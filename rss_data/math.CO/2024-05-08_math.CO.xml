      <title>Bivariate $P$- and $Q$-polynomial structures of the association schemes based on attenuated spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bivariate $P$- and $Q$-polynomial structures of association schemes based on attenuated spaces are examined using recurrence and difference relations of the bivariate polynomials which form the eigenvalues of the scheme. These bispectral properties are obtained from contiguity relations of univariate dual $q$-Hahn and affine $q$-Krawtchouk polynomials. The bispectral algebra associated to the bivariate polynomials is investigated, as well as the subconstituent algebra of the schemes. The properties of the schemes are compared to those of the non-binary Johnson schemes through a limit.</description>

      <title>Excluding a clique or a biclique in graphs of bounded induced matching treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $\mathcal{T}$ is a tree decomposition of a graph $G$, we write $\mu(\mathcal{T})$ for the maximum size of an induced matching in $G$ all of whose edges intersect one bag of $\mathcal{T}$. The induced matching treewidth of a graph $G$ is the minimum value of $\mu(\mathcal{T})$ over all tree decompositions $\mathcal{T}$ of~$G$. Classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth admit polynomial-time algorithms for a number of problems, including INDEPENDENT SET, $k$-COLORING, ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL, and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. In this paper, we focus on structural properties of such classes.
  First, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed biclique as an induced subgraph have bounded tree-independence number, which is another well-studied parameter defined in terms of tree decompositions. This sufficient condition about excluding a biclique is also necessary, as bicliques have unbounded tree-independence number. Second, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed clique have bounded chromatic number. That is, classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth are $\chi$-bounded. Our results confirm two conjectures from a recent manuscript of Lima et al. [arXiv 2024].</description>

      <title>Additive triples in groups of odd prime order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. For nontrivial proper subsets $A,B$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of cardinality $s,t$, respectively, we count the number $r(A,B,B)$ of additive triples, namely elements of the form $(a, b, a+b)$ in $A \times B \times B$. For given $s,t$, what is the spectrum of possible values for $r(A,B,B)$? In the special case $A=B$, the additive triple is called a Schur triple. Various authors have given bounds on the number $r(A,A,A)$ of Schur triples, and shown that the lower and upper bound can each be attained by a set $A$ that is an interval of $s$ consecutive elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. However, there are values of $p,s$ for which not every value between the lower and upper bounds is attainable. We consider here the general case where $A,B$ can be distinct. We use Pollard's generalization of the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem to derive bounds on the number $r(A,B,B)$ of additive triples. In contrast to the case $A=B$, we show that every value of $r(A,B,B)$ from the lower bound to the upper bound is attainable: each such value can be attained when $B$ is an interval of $t$ consecutive elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between random $d$-hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the size of the largest common induced subgraph of two independent random uniform $d$-hypergraphs of different sizes with $d\geq 3$. More precisely, its distribution is asymptotically concentrated on two points, and we obtain as a consequence a phase transition for the inclusion of the smallest hypergraph in the largest one. This generalizes to uniform random $d$-hypergraphs the results of Chatterjee and Diaconis for uniform random graphs.
  Our proofs rely on the first and second moment methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-centred regular graphs which are Ollivier-Ricci Bonnet-Myers sharp have been completely classified. When the conditions of self-centeredness and regularity are removed it is an open problem on what the classification is. We present a complete classification of Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs with a diameter 2 and show that there exists Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs of diameter 3, 4 and 6 that belong to a family of graphs called symmetrical antitees.</description>

      <title>Degree sequence condition for Hamiltonicity in tough graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing both Dirac's condition and Ore's condition for Hamilton cycles, Chvatal in 1972 established a degree sequence condition for the existence of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. Hoang in 1995 generalized Chvatal's degree sequence condition for 1-tough graphs and conjectured a t-tough analogue for any positive integer t at least 1. Hoang in the same paper verified his conjecture for t at most 3 and recently Hoang and Robin arXiv:2303.03479v2 verified the conjecture for t = 4. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for all t at least 4.</description>

      <title>Tilings of Flat Tori by Congruent Hexagons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex hexagons that can tile the plane have been classified into three types. For the generic cases (not necessarily convex) of the three types and two other special cases, we classify tilings of the plane under the assumption that all vertices have degree $3$. Then we use the classification to describe the corresponding hexagonal tilings of flat tori and their moduli spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the $e$-positivity of spider graphs of the form $S(4m+2,\, 2m,\, 1)$, which was conjectured by Aliniaeifard, Wang and van Willigenburg. A key to our proof is the $e_I$-expansion formula of the chromatic symmetric function of paths due to Shareshian and Wachs, where the symbol~$I$ indicates integer compositions rather than partitions. Following the strategy of the divide-and-conquer technique, we pick out one or two positive $e_J$-terms for each negative $e_I$-term in an $e$-expression for the spiders, where $J$ are selected to be distinct compositions obtained by rearranging the parts of $I$.</description>

      <title>On vector parking functions and q-analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2000, it was demonstrated that the set of $x$-parking functions of length $n$, where $x$=($a,b,...,b$) $\in \mathbbm{N}^n$, is equivalent to the set of rooted multicolored forests on [$n$]=\{1,...,$n$\}. In 2020, Yue Cai and Catherine H. Yan systematically investigated the properties of rational parking functions. Subsequently, a series of Context-free grammars possessing the requisite property were introduced by William Y.C. Chen and Harold R.L. Yang in 2021. %An Abelian-type identity is derived from a comparable methodology and grammatical framework. %Leveraging a comparable methodology and grammatical framework, an Abelian-type identity is derived herein. In this paper, I discuss generalized parking functions in terms of grammars. The primary result is to obtain the q-analogue about the number of '1's in certain vector parking functions with the assistance of grammars.</description>

      <title>On linear-combinatorial problems associated with subspaces spanned by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete answer to the question about subspaces generated by $\{\pm 1\}$-vectors, which arose in the work of I.Kanter and H.Sompolinsky on associative memories, is given. More precisely, let vectors $v_1, \ldots , v_p,$ $p\leq n-1,$ be chosen at random uniformly and independently from $\{\pm 1\}^n \subset {\bf R}^n.$ Then the probability ${\mathbb P}(p, n)$ that $$span \ \langle v_1, \ldots , v_p \rangle \cap \left\{ \{\pm 1\}^n \setminus \{\pm v_1, \ldots , \pm v_p\}\right\} \ne \emptyset \ $$ is shown to be $$4{p \choose 3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n + O\left(\left(\frac{5}{8} + o_n(1)\right)^n\right) \quad \mbox{as} \quad n\to \infty,$$ where the constant implied by the $O$-notation does not depend on $p$. The main term in this estimate is the probability that some 3 vectors $v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, v_{j_3}$ of $v_j$, $j= 1, \ldots , p,$ have a linear combination that is a $\{\pm 1\}$-vector different from $\pm v_{j_1}, \pm v_{j_2}, \pm v_{j_3}. $</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-player game played on undirected graphs called Trail Trap, which is a variant of a game known as Partizan Edge Geography. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree, and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that Trail Trap is NP-hard, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$ as well as for disconnected graphs. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>Brooks-type colourings of digraphs in linear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brooks' Theorem is a fundamental result on graph colouring, stating that the chromatic number of a graph is almost always upper bounded by its maximal degree. Lov\'asz showed that such a colouring may then be computed in linear time when it exists. Many analogues are known for variants of (di)graph colouring, notably for list-colouring and partitions into subgraphs with prescribed degeneracy. One of the most general results of this kind is due to Borodin, Kostochka, and Toft, when asking for classes of colours to satisfy "variable degeneracy" constraints. An extension of this result to digraphs has recently been proposed by Bang-Jensen, Schweser, and Stiebitz, by considering colourings as partitions into "variable weakly degenerate" subdigraphs. Unlike earlier variants, there exists no linear-time algorithm to produce colourings for these generalisations.
  We introduce the notion of (variable) bidegeneracy for digraphs, capturing multiple (di)graph degeneracy variants. We define the corresponding concept of $F$-dicolouring, where $F = (f_1,...,f_s)$ is a vector of functions, and an $F$-dicolouring requires vertices coloured $i$ to induce a "strictly-$f_i$-bidegenerate" subdigraph. We prove an analogue of Brooks' theorem for $F$-dicolouring, generalising the result of Bang-Jensen et al., and earlier analogues in turn.
  Our new approach provides a linear-time algorithm that, given a digraph $D$, either produces an $F$-dicolouring of $D$, or correctly certifies that none exist. This yields the first linear-time algorithms to compute (di)colourings corresponding to the aforementioned generalisations of Brooks' theorem. In turn, it gives an unified framework to compute such colourings for various intermediate generalisations of Brooks' theorem such as list-(di)colouring and partitioning into (variable) degenerate sub(di)graphs.</description>

      <title>Understanding High-Order Network Structure using Permissible Walks on Attributed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs have been a recent focus of study in mathematical data science as a tool to understand complex networks with high-order connections. One question of particular relevance is how to leverage information carried in hypergraph attributions when doing walk-based techniques. In this work, we focus on a new generalization of a walk in a network that recovers previous approaches and allows for a description of permissible walks in hypergraphs. Permissible walk graphs are constructed by intersecting the attributed $s$-line graph of a hypergraph with a relation respecting graph. The attribution of the hypergraph's line graph commonly carries over information from categorical and temporal attributions of the original hypergraph. To demonstrate this approach on a temporally attributed example, we apply our framework to a Reddit data set composed of hyperedges as threads and authors as nodes where post times are tracked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field and let $E$ be the natural representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$. Given a vector space $V$, let $\Delta^{(2,1^{N-1})}V$ be the kernel of the multiplication map $\bigwedge^N V \otimes V \rightarrow \bigwedge^{N+1}V$. We construct an explicit $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-isomorphism $\mathrm{Sym}^{N-1}E \otimes \bigwedge^{N+1} \mathrm{Sym}^{d+1}E \cong \Delta^{(2,1^{N-1})} \mathrm{Sym}^d E$. This $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-isomorphism is a modular lift of the $q$-binomial identity $q^{\frac{N(N-1)}{2}}[N]_q \binom{d+1}{N+1}_q = s_{(2,1^{N-1})}(1,q,\ldots, q^d)$, where $s_{(2,1^{N-1})}$ is the Schur function for the partition $(2,1^{N-1})$. This identity, which follows from our main theorem, implies the existence of an isomorphism when $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of complex numbers but it is notable, and not typical of the general case, that there is an explicit isomorphism defined in a uniform way for any field.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the magnitude homology of a finite digraph $G$ as a certain subquotient of its path algebra. We use this to prove that the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group for any $\ell$, and to describe its rank. This allows us to give a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_2)$, equivalent to vanishing of ${\rm MH}_{2,\ell}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for $\ell&gt;2.$ Recall that a digraph is called diagonal, if its magnitude homology is concentrated in diagonal degrees. Using the condition $(\mathcal V_2),$ we show that the GLMY-fundamental group of a diagonal (undirected) graph is trivial. In other words, the two-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. Besides, we show that the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is quadratic for any $G.$ To obtain a source of examples of (non-)diagonal digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a simplicial complex $K$. For a combinatorial triangulation $K$ of a piecewise-linear manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a combinatorial triangulation of a closed piecewise-linear manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

Abstract: Much progress has been made on the problem of calculating $g(n)$ for various classes of integers $n$, where $g$ is the group-counting function. We approach the inverse problem of solving the equations $g(n) = 6$ and $g(n) = 7$ in $n$. The determination of $n$ for which $g(n) = k$ has been carried out by G. A.

      <title>Tropical Feichtner-Yuzvinsky and positivity criterion for fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Chow ring of any simplicial fan is isomorphic to the middle degree part of the tropical cohomology ring of its canonical compactification. Using this result, we prove a tropical analogue of Kleiman's criterion of ampleness for fans.
  In the case of tropical fans that are homology manifolds, we obtain an isomorphism between the Chow ring of the fan and the entire tropical cohomology of the canonical compactification. When applied to matroids, this provides a new representation of the Chow ring of a matroid as the cohomology ring of a projective tropical manifold.</description>

      <title>Relative Fractional Independence Number and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$, as $$\alpha^*(G|H)=\max_{W}\frac{\alpha(G\boxtimes W)}{\alpha(H\boxtimes W)},$$ where the maximum is taken over all graphs $W$, $G\boxtimes W$ is the strong product of $G$ and $W$, and $\alpha$ denotes the independence number. We give a non-trivial linear program to compute $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. We show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the zero-error Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the zero-error Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>

      <title>Cliquewidth and dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every poset with bounded cliquewidth and with sufficiently large dimension contains the standard example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. This applies in particular to posets whose cover graphs have bounded treewidth, as the cliquewidth of a poset is bounded in terms of the treewidth of the cover graph. For the latter posets, we prove a stronger statement: every such poset with sufficiently large dimension contains the Kelly example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. Using this result, we obtain a full characterization of the minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ such that posets with cover graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ have bounded dimension: they are exactly the classes excluding the cover graph of some Kelly example. Finally, we consider a variant of poset dimension called Boolean dimension, and we prove that posets with bounded cliquewidth have bounded Boolean dimension.
  The proofs rely on Colcombet's deterministic version of Simon's factorization theorem, which is a fundamental tool in formal language and automata theory, and which we believe deserves a wider recognition in structural and algorithmic graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A digraph $H$ is called ubiquitous if every digraph that contains arbitrarily many vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ also contains infinitely many vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. We study oriented double rays, that is, digraphs $H$ whose underlying undirected graphs are double rays. Calling a vertex of an oriented double ray a turn if it has in-degree or out-degree 2, we prove that an oriented double ray with at least one turn is ubiquitous if and only if it has a (finite) odd number of turns. It remains an open problem to determine whether the consistently oriented double ray is ubiquitous.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new signed elementary symmetric function expansion of the chromatic quasisymmetric function of any natural unit interval graph. We then use a sign-reversing involution to prove a new combinatorial formula for K-chains, which are graphs formed by joining cliques at single vertices. This formula immediately implies $e$-positivity and $e$-unimodality for K-chains. We also prove a version of our signed $e$-expansion for arbitrary graphs.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a pseudotree from the distance matrix of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices. The distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of the boundary of a graph $G$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$. Given a square matrix $\hat{B}$ of order $\kappa$, we prove under which conditions $\hat{B}$ is the distance matrix $\hat{D}_T$ of the set of leaves of a tree $T$, which is precisely its boundary. We show that if $G$ is either a tree or a unicyclic graph with girth $g\geq 5$ vertices, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of the boundary of $G$ and we also conjecture that this statement holds for every connected graph. Moreover, two algorithms for reconstructing a tree and a unicyclic graph from the distance matrix of their boundaries are given, whose time complexities in the worst case are, respectively, $O(\kappa n)$ and $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Diameter of the inversion graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\vec{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endvertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a labelled graph $G$, denoted by ${\mathcal{I}}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the labelled orientations of $G$ in which two labelled orientations $\vec{G}_1$ and $\vec{G}_2$ of $G$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\vec{G}_1$ into $\vec{G}_2$. In this paper, we study the inversion diameter of a graph which is the diameter of its inversion graph denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. We show that the inversion diameter is tied to the star chromatic number, the acyclic chromatic number and the oriented chromatic number. Thus a graph class has bounded inversion diameter if and only if it also has bounded star chromatic number, acyclic chromatic number and oriented chromatic number. We give some upper bounds on the inversion diameter of a graph $G$ contained in one of the following graph classes: planar graphs ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 12$), planar graphs of girth 8 ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 3$), graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2\Delta -1$), graphs with treewidth at mots $t$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2t$).
  We also show that determining the inversion diameter of a given graph is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of Farey words and their traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of 3-variable "Farey polynomials" that are closely connected with the geometry and topology of $3$-manifolds and orbifolds as they can be used to produce concrete realisations of the boundaries and local coordinates for one-complex-dimensional deformation spaces of Kleinian groups. As such, this family of polynomials has a number of quite remarkable properties. We study these polynomials from an abstract combinatorial viewpoint, including a recursive definition extending that which is known in the literature for the special case of manifolds, even beyond what the geometry predicts. We also present some intriguing examples and conjectures which we would like to bring to the attention of researchers interested in algebraic combinatorics and hypergeometric functions.
  The results in this paper additionally provide a practical approach to various classification problems for rank-two subgroups of PSL(2,C) since they, together with other recent work of the authors, make it possible to provide certificates that certain groups are discrete and free, and effective ways to identify relators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short topological proof of coherence for categorified non-symmetric operads by using the fact that the diagrams involved form the 1-skeleton of simply connected CW complexes. We also obtain a "one-step" topological proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem for symmetric monoidal categories, as suggested by Kapranov in 1993. Our analysis is based on a notion of combinatorial homotopy, which we further study in the special case of polyhedral complexes, leading to a second geometrical proof of coherence which is very close to Mac Lane's original argument. We use Morse theory to show that this second method is (strictly) less general than the first. We provide a detailed analysis of how both methods allow us to deduce these two categorical coherence results and discuss possible generalizations to higher categories.</description>

Abstract: We express correlators of the Jacobi $\beta$ ensemble in terms of (a special case of) $b$-Hurwitz numbers, a deformation of Hurwitz numbers recently introduced by Chapuy and Dolega. The proof relies on Kadell's generalization of the Selberg integral. The Laguerre limit is also considered. All the relevant $b$-Hurwitz numbers are interpreted (following Bonzom, Chapuy, and Dolega) in terms of colored monotone Hurwitz maps.</description>

      <title>A general formula for the index of depth stability of edge ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By a classical result of Brodmann, the function $\operatorname{depth} R/I^t$ is asymptotically a constant, i.e. there is a number $s$ such that $\operatorname{depth} R/I^t = \operatorname{depth} R/I^s$ for $t &gt; s$. One calls the smallest number $s$ with this property the index of depth stability of $I$ and denotes it by $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$. This invariant remains mysterious til now. The main result of this paper gives an explicit formula for $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ when $I$ is an arbitrary ideal generated by squarefree monomials of degree 2. That is the first general case where one can characterize $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ explicitly. The formula expresses $\operatorname{dstab}(I)$ in terms of the associated graph. The proof involves new techniques which relate different topics such as simplicial complexes, systems of linear inequalities, graph parallelizations, and ear decompositions. It provides an effective method for the study of powers of edge ideals.</description>

Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of quantum properties of finite graphs, namely, quantum asymmetry, quantum symmetry, and quantum isomorphism. We define the Schmidt alternative for a class of graphs, which reveals to be a useful tool for studying quantum symmetries of graphs. After showing that quantum isomorphic graphs have quantum isomorphic centers and connected components, we solve the aforementioned problems for the classes of cographs and forests. We also compute their quantum automorphism groups for the first time. In doing so, we extend to the noncommutative setting a theorem of Jordan. Using general results on $\mathcal F$-cographs, we extend the precedent results to $\mathcal G_5$-cographs and tree-cographs, two distinct strictly proper superclasses of cographs and forests respectively. Finally, we show that quantum isomorphic planar graphs are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds for Many Pivot Rules for the Simplex Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a pivot rule for the simplex method that guarantees a strongly polynomial run-time is a longstanding, fundamental open problem in the theory of linear programming. The leading pivot rule in theory is the shadow pivot rule, which solves a linear program by projecting the feasible region onto a polygon. It has been shown to perform in expected strongly polynomial time on uniformly random instances and in smoothed analysis. In practice, the pivot rule of choice is the steepest edge rule, which normalizes the set of improving neighbors and then chooses a maximally improving normalized neighbor. Exponential lower bounds are known for both rules in worst-case analysis. However, for the shadow simplex method, all exponential examples were only proven for one choice of projection, and for the steepest edge rule, the lower bounds were only proven for the Euclidean norm. In this work, we construct linear programs for which any choice of projection for shadow rule variants will lead to an exponential run-time and exponential examples for any choice of norm for a steepest edge variant.</description>

In this paper, we provide a description of the package $\texttt{PolyominoIdeals}$ for the computer algebra software $\texttt{Macaulay2}$. More precisely, this package provides some functions that allow to define the ideal $I_{\mathcal{P}}$ in $\texttt{Macaulay2}$ and to compute its algebraic invariants or verifying its algebraic properties. We explain the usage of these functions and also give some examples. Refer to the tool provided in $\textit{https://rizwan.phd/polyo/}$ to get easier the desired input data for $\texttt{Macaulay2}$.</description>

Abstract: The critical beta-splitting tree, introduced by Aldous, is a Markov branching phylogenetic tree of poly-logarithmic height. Recently, by a technical analysis, Aldous and Pittel proved, amongst other results, a central limit theorem for the height $H_n$ of a random leaf.
  We give an alternative proof, via contraction methods for random recursive structures. These techniques were developed by Neininger and R\"uschendorf, motivated by Pittel's article "Normal convergence problem? Two moments and a recurrence may be the clues." Aldous and Pittel estimated the first two moments of $H_n$, with great precision. We show that a limit theorem follows, and bound the distance from normality.</description>
