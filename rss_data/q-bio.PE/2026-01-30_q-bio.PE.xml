      <title>Long-term evolution of regulatory DNA sequences. Part 2: Theory and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promoters and enhancers are cis-regulatory elements (CREs), DNA sequences that bind transcription factor (TF) proteins to up- or down-regulate target genes. Decades-long efforts yielded TF-DNA interaction models that predict how strongly an individual TF binds arbitrary DNA sequences and how individual binding events on the CRE combine to affect gene expression. These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a "holy grail" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable? In this article, the second of a two-part series, we review the application of evolutionary concepts - epistasis, robustness, evolvability, tunability, plasticity, and bet-hedging - to the evolution of gene regulatory sequences. We then evaluate the potential for a unifying theory for the evolution of regulatory sequences, and identify key open challenges.</description>

      <title>Diversifying Toxicity Search in Large Language Models Through Speciation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary prompt search is a practical black-box approach for red teaming large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often collapse onto a small family of high-performing prompts, limiting coverage of distinct failure modes. We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.</description>

      <title>The quenched structured coalescent for diploid population models on finite graphs with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes both the mean-field model of Birkner et al. [\textit{Electron. J. Probab.} 23: 1-44 (2018)] and the haploid structured model of M\"{o}hle [\textit{Theor. Popul. Biol.} 2024 Apr:156:103-116]. We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\Psi$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments. Several examples are given and their quenched scaling limits established.</description>

      <title>Impact of behavioral heterogeneity on epidemic outcome and its mapping into effective network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human behavior plays a critical role in shaping epidemic trajectories. During health crises, people respond in diverse ways in terms of self-protection and adherence to recommended measures, largely reflecting differences in how individuals assess risk. This behavioral variability induces effective heterogeneity into key epidemic parameters, such as infectivity and susceptibility. We introduce a minimal extension of the susceptible-infected-removed~(SIR) model, denoted HeSIR, that captures these effects through a simple bimodal scheme, where individuals may have higher or lower transmission--related traits. We derive a closed-form expression for the epidemic threshold in terms of the model parameters, and the network's degree distribution and homophily, defined as the tendency of like--risk individuals to preferentially interact. We identify a resurgence regime just beyond the classical threshold, where the number of infected individuals may initially decline before surging into large-scale transmission. Through simulations on homogeneous and heterogeneous network topologies we corroborate the analytical results and highlight how variations in susceptibility and infectivity influence the epidemic dynamics. We further show that, under suitable assumptions, the HeSIR model maps onto a standard SIR process on an appropriately modified contact network, providing a unified interpretation in terms of structural connectivity. Our findings quantify the effect of heterogeneous behavioral responses, especially in the presence of homophily, and caution against underestimating epidemic potential in fragmented populations, which may undermine timely containment efforts. The results also extend to heterogeneity arising from biological or other non-behavioral sources.</description>

      <title>Kinetic formulation of compartmental epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic model that couples the movement of a population of individuals with the dynamics of a pathogen in the same population. We consider that transmission occurs when a susceptible and an infectious individual are sufficiently close for a sufficiently long time. We show that the model is formally compatible with the well-known SIRS model in mathematical epidemiology. Namely, after identifying an appropriate dimensionless variable and considering the limit when that variable is small, we introduce a partial differential equation model of advection-drift-diffusion type (mesoscopic model), which for spatially homogeneous solutions reduces to the SIRS model. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in appropriate spaces for particular instances of the model. We finish with some examples and discuss possible applications and generalisation of this modelling approach, linking kinetic models, evolutionary game theory, and mathematical epidemiology.</description>
