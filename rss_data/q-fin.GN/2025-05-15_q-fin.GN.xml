      <title>Choices or constraints: decoding financial empowerment among women entrepreneurs in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the empowerment of women entrepreneurs in the context of entrepreneurial financing in France. It explores the factors that allow some women entrepreneurs to access certain categories of external finance more easily. The theoretical framework used is based on the concept of empowerment, explored through its personal and relational dimensions. The study relies on a quantitative approach, using data from a representative of women entrepreneurs. The results show that the status of a founder affects access to external finance in different ways: it increases the chances of successful fundraising, but reduces the chances of obtaining bank finance. This finding highlights the importance of empowerment dynamics, which vary according to the type of financing. In addition, characteristics such as the presence of a spouse in the business, high income, membership of a professional network and the diversity of this network complete the analysis of inequalities in access. This study, the first of its kind in France, suggests ways of enriching our understanding of the diversity of situations experienced by female founders, thus helping to deconstruct the homogeneous image of women's entrepreneurship.</description>

      <title>Optimal Post-Hoc Theorizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many economic questions, the empirical results are not interesting unless they are strong. For these questions, theorizing before the results are known is not always optimal. Instead, the optimal sequencing of theory and empirics trades off a ``Darwinian Learning'' effect from theorizing first with a ``Statistical Learning'' effect from examining the data first. This short paper formalizes the tradeoff in a Bayesian model. In the modern era of mature economic theory and enormous datasets, I argue that post hoc theorizing is typically optimal.</description>
