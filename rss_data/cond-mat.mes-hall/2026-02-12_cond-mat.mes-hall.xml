      <title>Chiral states induced by symmetry-breaking in $\alpha-T_3$ lattices: Magnetic field effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $\alpha-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $\alpha$. The latter tunes the $\alpha-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($\alpha=0$) to a dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $\Delta(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $\Delta(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $\alpha$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $\alpha-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.</description>

      <title>Linear thermal noise induced by Berry curvature dipole in a four-terminal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we numerically investigate linear thermal noise in a four-terminal system with a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Moire driven edge reconstruction in Fractional quantum anomalous Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fractional edge modes in moire fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, focusing on the role of lattice momentum conservation and umklapp scattering. For the hierarchical nu=2/3 state, we show that, for a class of microscopic edge realizations, moire-enabled umklapp processes can stabilize the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point even in the absence of disorder.Our results illustrate how lattice momentum constraints can qualitatively reshape the interaction structure and low-energy behavior of fractional edge modes. The study of Umklapp processes in edge reconstruction serves as a crucial bridge to understanding thermal and electrical transport in the hierarchical fractional quantum anomalous Hall states found in lattice systems of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Dispersive detection of a charge qubit with a broadband high-impedance quantum-Hall plasmon resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ \nu e^2$ that can exceed 10 k$\Omega$ for the Landau-level filling factor $\nu \leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Quantum Point Contact in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moir\'e domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moir\'e domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moir\'e domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moir\'e domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moir\'e domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).</description>

      <title>Enhanced effective masses, spin-orbit polarization, and dispersion relations in 2D hole gases under strongly asymmetric confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion of Rashba-split heavy-hole subbands in GaAs two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is difficult to access experimentally because strong heavy-hole-light-hole mixing produces non-parabolicity and breaks the usual correspondence between carrier density and Fermi wave vector. Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B &lt; 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $\Delta_\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.</description>

      <title>Photon counting beyond the rotating-wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.</description>

      <title>Pseudorotation and N-body Forces in an Optical Matter System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.</description>

      <title>Floquet Control of Electron and Exciton Transport in Kekul\'e-Distorted Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekul\'e-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekul\'e distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekul\'e distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity-induced non-Hermitian skin effect from the breakdown of scale-free localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions, typically manifesting as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundaries. By bridging the boundaries with a tunable impurity bond, one can access intermediate regimes where scale-free localization (SFL) can emerge. Here, we investigate the competition between such boundary coupling and quasiperiodic disorder in a non-reciprocal lattice. Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A web of exact mappings from RK models to spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Atomically-sharp magnetic soliton in the square-net lattice EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors provide a unique materials platform in which long-range magnetic order coexists with strongly bound excitons. Because excitonic states and magnetic moments originate from the same electronic orbitals and are coupled through intrinsic exchange interactions, optical excitations in these systems exhibit pronounced sensitivity to magnetic order. Recent experiments have revealed unusually strong magneto-optical responses, as well as direct coupling between excitons and magnons, establishing new routes for controlling light-matter interactions with spin degrees of freedom. This Review surveys key developments in the field, focusing on representative material systems, experimental signatures of exciton-magnetism coupling, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe these phenomena. We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin.</description>

      <title>Antiferroaxial altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the N\'{e}el vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping N\'{e}el-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics in magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators: Low-power neuron-like activation and transmission suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators composed of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films coupled to CoFeB nanostripes. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we observe a systematic downshift of the spin-wave transmission gaps as the excitation power increases. This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption. Our results highlight magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators as compact low-power nonlinear elements for neuromorphic magnonic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Establishing the Magnetoelastic Origin of Spin-Wave Routing through Focused Ion Beam Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin waves are promising information carriers for analog and wave-based computing, requiring compact and precisely engineered scattering landscapes. Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation enables such control by locally modifying the spin-wave dispersion in yttrium iron garnet (YIG), yet the underlying crystallographic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating strain tensors derived from the experimental magnetoelastic field reproduce the characteristic non-monotonic wavelength behavior. These results establish a physical basis for FIB-engineered graded-index (GRIN) spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Growth and Transport Properties of InAsSb Nanoflags</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work reports, for the first time, the growth of high-quality free-standing InAsSb nanoflags and their electronic properties. Different growth conditions have been explored, and zinc-blende InAsSb nanoflags of various composition have been obtained. In particular, InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags are on average (2000+-180) nm long, (640+-50) nm wide, and (130+-30) nm thick. We show that these nanoflags have a Land\'e g-factor larger than InAs and InSb and a mobility comparable to those of the best performing InAs and InSb nanoflags. Besides, we show evidence for a surface Fermi level pinning in the conductance band of these InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags, similar to the well-known behavior of InAs. This promises to make InAsSb easy to couple to superconductors, while keeping or improving many of the features that make InSb an interesting material for quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved, in part due to the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without requiring a periodic moir\'e supercell. Our approach combines a momentum-space continuum model for both electronic and phononic structures with a generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory beyond the adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is strongly enhanced near the magic angle. The superconducting transition temperature induced by low-energy phonons peaks at $1.1^\circ$ around 1 K, and remains finite for a range of angles both below and above the magic angles. We predict that superconductivity persists up to $\sim 1.4^\circ$, where superconductivity has been recently observed despite the dispersive electronic bands. Beyond a large density of states, we identify a key condition for strong EPC: resonance between the electronic bandwidth and the dominant phonon frequencies. We also show that the EPC strength of a specific phonon corresponds to the modification of the moir\'e potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, which are experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Braid-Protected Unpaired Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies (dubbed nodal points in momentum space) play fundamental roles in understanding exotic properties of light and matter. In lattice systems, unpaired band-structure degeneracies are subject to well-established no-go (doubling) theorems that universally apply to both closed Hermitian systems and open non-Hermitian systems. However, the non-Abelian braid topology of non-Hermitian multi-band systems provides a loophole to these constraints. Here we successfully leverage this loophole in a non-Hermitian three-band system, implementing an unpaired third-order exceptional point (EP3), which manifests as a non-Abelian monopole. We explicitly demonstrate the intricate braiding topology and non-Abelian, path-dependent, fusion rules underlying the unpaired EP3. The experiment uses a new design of single-photon interferometry, enabling eigenstate and spectral resolutions for multi-band systems with widely tunable parameters. Thus, the union of state-of-the-art experiments, fundamental theory, and everyday concepts such as braids pave the way toward the highly exotic non-Abelian topology unique to non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Approach to Light-Induced Hall Transport in Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling real-space methodology to compute time-resolved electrical responses of materials driven far-from-equilibrium, with energy relaxation and disorder treated on equal footing. Applying this approach to AB-stacked (Bernal) bilayer graphene, driven by a circularly polarized optical pulse, we observe the generation of a finite Hall conductivity. This Hall signal oscillates during optical driving and remains sizable after the light is switched off before relaxing toward equilibrium. Remarkably, this dynamical Hall response is robust in the presence of realistic descriptions of disorder, suggesting that disorder and relaxation dynamics can be leveraged as design parameters rather than being limitations. More broadly, our new methodology enables the investigation of electrical responses in driven, complex disordered quantum materials and highlights how engineered energy transfer pathways can enable ultrafast optoelectronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity of semimetallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of $164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of graphite.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using realistic tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. We also analyze the spatial structure of the zero modes and the bulk gap closing through channel-resolved density profiles. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations based on the Binding energy and Bond Charge model and a modified version of it. The results indicate that the modified BBC potential decays in an exponential manner with distance, which suppresses electron electron interactions. The hopping integrals exhibit a pronounced decrease over distance and shift with parameter variation. A band gap opens once the parameter exceeds a certain threshold. The density of states shows a prominent peak near the Fermi level, whereas the low-energy region remains largely unchanged. The low energy helical wave functions in graphene display topological characteristics, including pseudospin momentum locking and a {\pi} Berry phase, resulting in distinctive transport properties. By avoiding the Coulomb singularity, the model offers valuable insights for the engineering of screening in two-dimensional systems and the design of topological devices.</description>

Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Coherence Protection for Mobile Spin Qubits in Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity</title>

Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement and control of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Moreover, we show that coherent displacive phononic excitations in tandem with electron-phonon coupling is a pathway to dynamically control phonon anharmonicity. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.</description>

      <title>Unconventional orbital currents and torques due to ferro-rotational orbital textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum transport has emerged as a promising route for manipulating magnetic devices, yet its generation has largely relied on the conventional orbital Hall effect. Here, we show that ferro-rotational order enables the electrical generation of unconventional orbital currents. These orbital currents represent the orbital counterparts of spin currents due to ferromagnetic order, but arise from rotation-induced symmetry breaking rather than time-reversal symmetry breaking or spin-orbit coupling. Using tight-binding models, we identify the underlying intrinsic, nonrelativistic mechanism categorized as an electric hexadecapole moment and corroborate our findings with first-principles calculations for the ferro-rotational material TiAu$_4$. We further show that these rotation-induced orbital currents lead to surface orbital accumulation and unconventional orbital torque in a ferro-rotational/ferromagnetic metallic bilayer, allowing deterministic field-free switching. Our findings unveil a novel pathway for generating orbital currents beyond the conventional orbital Hall effect, broadening the landscape of orbitronics research to include novel ferroic materials and higher-order electric multipoles.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, europium chalcogenides, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Our theory resolves a long-standing conceptual difficulty in defining orbital magnetization in superconducting systems, and measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct experimental test.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>
