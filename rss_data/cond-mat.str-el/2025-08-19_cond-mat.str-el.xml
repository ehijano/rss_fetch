      <title>Mn4Al11: A Half-Semimetal Candidate with Anomalous Electronic Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-semimetals, characterized by their spin-polarized electronic states, hold significant promise for spintronic applications but remain scarce due to stringent electronic and magnetic criteria. Through a combination of transport measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures. Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state.</description>

      <title>Off-Diagonal dipolar interactions in the mixed Ising--XY magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in the mixed-anisotropy magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$. Motivated by experimental observations showing an unexpectedly rapid suppression of the ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$ upon substitution of Ho by Er ions, we use Monte Carlo simulations incorporating off-diagonal dipolar terms to elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. Our results reveal that, unlike in the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it. This leads to a pronounced reduction of $T_c$, closely matching experimental data, thereby resolving discrepancies with mean-field predictions. The findings underscore the essential role of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in determining the magnetic properties of mixed-anisotropy dipolar systems.</description>

      <title>Charge-4$e$ Anyon Superconductor from Doping $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid can emerge in the SU($4$) Hubbard model on triangular lattice. A natural question then arises: What is the phase upon doping? In this work, we show the possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge $c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Transport evidence of current-induced nematic Dirac valleys in a parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst Effect and Its Implications for Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Kagome Metal ScV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order (CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism, and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral charge order remain possible.</description>

      <title>High-field NMR study of field-induced states in Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square cupola antiferromagnet Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$ exhibits the intriguing magnetoelectric responses arising from the consecutive change in the magnetic quadrupolar-type configuration of magnetic moments under external magnetic fields higher than 15 T. To clarify the high-field magnetic structures in Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$, an NMR measurement was performed in pulsed fields up to 32.2 T significantly extending the field range accessible by superconducting magnets. The double-peak structure of NMR spectra emerging above 29 T applied along the [001] direction evidences the successive magnetic transitions. The field dependence of NMR spectra was analyzed on the basis of cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to propose possible magnetic structures for the high-field magnetic states.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Interference in LiFeAs: Signature of Inelastic Tunneling through Spin Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample. Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization of Low-Rank Antisymmetric Product of Geminals Wavefunction Using the Direct Givens Rotation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous study, we proposed the low-rank antisymmetric product of geminals (APG) method, which reconstructs the wavefunction by extracting only the important eigenvalues from the APG wave function. However, its practical application was limited by the high computational cost from an orbital optimization process, making higher-rank calculations difficult. In this work, we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Control of magnetic transition, metal-semiconductor transition, and magnetic anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric monolayer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.</description>

      <title>Preparation of the single-spinon wave function in a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of single-spinon wave functions, relevant for one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin models, in a quantum computer. We adopt the recently proposed ansatz \cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a complex band analysis of one-dimensional (1D) square and high-root topological insulators (HRTIs). We show that edge-state bands of HRTIs are sliced sections of impurity bands of a uniform tight-binding chain. A simplified topological characterization of HRTIs with generalized boundary conditions is carried out based on the existence of edge-state bands in the infinite HRTI and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions. Edge states in finite or semi-infinite 1D HRTIs are shown to be a subset of evanescent states of the infinite system and mapped onto impurity states of the uniform chain with effective energy-dependent edge potentials. The latter result allows the determination of the edge state levels without needing the diagonalization of real space or bulk Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Enhancement of Electron-Phonon Interaction in 2H-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Resonant dynamics of spin cluster in a periodically driven one-dimensional Rydberg lattice</title>

Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</description>

      <title>Structural contribution to light-induced gap suppression in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>CoRuTiGe: A Possible Spin Gapless Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuTiGe, synthesized using the arc melting technique. Crystal structure analysis reveals a tetragonal structure at room temperature. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field indicate ferromagnetic nature with a saturation magnetization of 0.681 mB/f.u. at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility. Hall effect analysis reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in CoRuTiGe arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, a well-defined symmetric negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. These findings suggest that CoRuTiGe holds significant promise for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Fermi velocity and magic angle renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model. Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and $U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from $1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta&gt;\theta_{max}$, $T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For $\theta&lt;\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity evidence for quantum criticality in clean infinite-layer nickelate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\EuScript{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\EuScript{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\EuScript{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\EuScript{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\EuScript{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\EuScript{B}$ of $\EuScript{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\EuScript{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\EuScript{B}$ to $A^\EuScript{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\EuScript{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\EuScript{C}_A}$ where $\EuScript{C}=\EuScript{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\EuScript{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>

Abstract: We report the successful growth of highly textured thin films of (Fe,Ni)5GeTe2 two-dimensional ferromagnet on c-plane sapphire using pulsed laser deposition. Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction confirms preferential orientation along the (000l) direction, indicative of a high crystallographic texture. These films of van der Waals (vdW) type interplanar bonding exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature reaching = 495 K. Electrical transport measurements reveal a clear anomalous Hall effect, with an anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall angle (%) of = 20 ohm-1cm-1 and = 0.90, respectively. Furthermore, the magnetoresistance displays a pronounced dependence on film thickness, highlighting the tunability of spin-dependent transport in these vdW ferromagnetic thin films.</description>

      <title>Noise signatures of a charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dot in mesoscopic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on thermoelectric phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions of Wigner Crystal in Magnetic Field and Berry Curvature: Multi-Particle Tunneling through Complex Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$ problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature, multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.</description>

      <title>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Topological defect-mediated corner states and higher-order bulk topology in a two-dimensional crystalline insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report appearance of non-trivial zero energy corner modes in the form of topological defects (trimers) in a carefully designed 2D crystalline topological insulator. The proposed scenario is developed via an unconventional stacking of 1D topological atomic chains with crystalline mirror symmetry along the diagonal (y=x) line. Our analysis shows that by systematically varying the hopping parameters t (intra-chain), v (within the unit cell) and w (between the unit cells) the system exhibits more than one distinct non-trivial second order topological phases. These phases are distinguished by the zero energy corner modes. In one of these phases the system supports four zero modes. Two of them reside on the trimers and the rest on isolated sites situated at the corner along the diagonal line. However, in the second case, the zero modes on the isolated sites persist at the corners while the zero modes on the trimers vanish. A critical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states helps in investigating the topology of these phases via using winding numbers. Our work also shows the bulk-corner correspondence that exist between the invariants and the zero modes at the corners. With four zero modes at the corners and a winding number as 2, we conclude that the system has transformed into a second order topological insulator via tuning of the hopping amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

Abstract: Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Broken inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase in EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</description>

      <title>Anyon dispersion from non-uniform magnetic field on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. We parametrize the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R&gt;1$ ($R &lt; 1$), and show that, for our choice of field, any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes can be mapped \emph{exactly} to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons. Remarkably, such spatially varying potential is sufficient to generate dispersion for the anyons, which we compute exactly, up to an overall scaling constant. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of a logarithmic partition function to investigate quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of a partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moir\'e superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moir\'e Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Field-Tailoring Quantum Materials: Magneto-Synthesis of Metastable Metallic Phases in a Trimer Iridate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic and strongly paramagnetic metals in addition to electron skew scattering on impurities is determined by internal mechanism linked to the Berry curvature, a quantum-mechanical property of the electron states of a perfect crystal. Experimentally, however, it has been established that the Berry curvature does not play any role in the Hall resistance of the ferromagnet URhGe. URhGe is so called altermagnetic ferromagnet which crystal symmetry includes operation of time inversion only in combination with rotations and reflections. The explanation for strictly zero Berry curvature of electronic states in this material lies in the non-symmorphic symmetry of its crystal lattice.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully gapped and realizes a class-DIII topological superconductor, characterized by two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>

      <title>Composite Bosons Superposition Ansatz Approach to One-Dimensional Trapped Few-Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena, offering tunable interactions and diverse trapping geometries. In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dynamically tunable hydrodynamic transport in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</description>
