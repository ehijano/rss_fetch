      <title>Predicting the Unpredictable under Subjective Expected Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a decision maker who is unaware of objects to be sampled and thus cannot form beliefs about the occurrence of particular objects. Ex ante she can form beliefs about the occurrence of novelty and the frequencies of yet to be known objects. Conditional on any sampled objects, she can also form beliefs about the next object being novel or being one of the previously sampled objects. We characterize behaviorally such beliefs under subjective expected utility. In doing so, we relate "reverse" Bayesianism, a central property in the literature on decision making under growing awareness, with exchangeable random partitions, the central property in the literature on the discovery of species problem and mutations in statistics, combinatorial probability theory, and population genetics. Partition exchangeable beliefs do not necessarily satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism. Yet, the most prominent models of exchangeable random partitions, the model by De Morgan (1838), the one parameter model of Ewens (1972), and the two parameter model of Pitman (1995) and Zabell (1997), do satisfy "reverse" Bayesianism.</description>

      <title>Optimistic and pessimistic approaches for cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative game theory aims to study how to divide a joint value created by a set of players. These games are often studied through the characteristic function form with transferable utility, which represents the value obtainable by each coalition. In the presence of externalities, there are many ways to define this value. Various models that account for different levels of player cooperation and the influence of external players on coalition value have been studied. Although there are different approaches, typically, the optimistic and pessimistic approaches provide sufficient insights into strategic interactions. This paper clarifies the interpretation of these approaches by providing a unified framework. We show that making sure that no coalition receives more than their (optimistic) upper bounds is always at least as difficult as guaranteeing their (pessimistic) lower bounds. We also show that if externalities are negative, providing these guarantees is always feasible. Then, we explore applications and show how our findings can be applied to derive results from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>A Continuous-Time Stochastic Model of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level and Consistency of Its Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper tests the validity of the critique of the fiscal theory of the price level. A stochastic general equilibrium model with continuous time is constructed. An active fiscal policy and a passive monetary policy have been set. Monetary policy manages the interest rate through the Taylor rule. The stochastic default factor in the special form is introduced. A complete definite system of equations is obtained for the detection of equilibrium. It is asserted that the peculiarities of the approach to modeling are of critical importance for verifying the presence of certain hypotheses and formulating conclusions. The results of this work are in support of the fiscal theory of the price level.</description>

      <title>Final Topology for Preference Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.02357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say a model is continuous in utilities (resp., preferences) if small perturbations of utility functions (resp., preferences) generate small changes in the model's outputs. While similar, these two questions are different. They are only equivalent when the following two sets are isomorphic: the set of continuous mappings from preferences to the model's outputs, and the set of continuous mappings from utilities to the model's outputs. In this paper, we study the topology for preference spaces defined by such an isomorphism. This study is practically significant, as continuity analysis is predominantly conducted through utility functions, rather than the underlying preference space. Our findings enable researchers to infer continuity in utility as indicative of continuity in underlying preferences.</description>

      <title>Choice and Attention across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study how past and future choices are linked in the framework of attention. Attention cannot be observed but past choices are necessarily considered in future decisions. This link connects two types of rationality violations, counterfactual and realized, where the former results from inattention and the latter fully pins down preferences. Results show that the necessary traces of limited attention lie within choice sequences because they enable and compel a decision maker to correct their "mistakes". The framework accommodates different attention structures and extends to framing, introducing choice sequences as an important channel to formulate, identify, and scrutinize limited attention.</description>

      <title>Exploration and Incentivizing Participation in Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06191v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Participation incentives a well-known issue inhibiting clinical trials. We frame this issue as a non-standard exploration-exploitation tradeoff: the trial would like to explore as uniformly as possible, whereas each patient prefers "exploitation", i.e., treatments that seem best. We incentivize participation by leveraging information asymmetry between the trial and the patients. We measure statistical performance via worst-case estimation error under adversarially generated outcomes, a standard objective for clinical trials. We obtain a near-optimal solution in terms of this objective: an incentive-compatible mechanism with a particular guarantee, and a nearly matching impossibility result for any incentive-compatible mechanism. Our results extend to heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>Refined Characterizations of Approval-based Committee Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In approval-based committee (ABC) elections, the goal is to select a fixed-size subset of the candidates, a so-called committee, based on the voters' approval ballots over the candidates. One of the most popular classes of ABC voting rules are ABC scoring rules, which have recently been characterized by Lackner and Skowron (2021). However, this characterization relies on a model where the output is a ranking of committees instead of a set of winning committees and no full characterization of ABC scoring rules exists in the latter standard setting. We address this issue by characterizing two important subclasses of ABC scoring rules in the standard ABC election model, thereby both extending the result of Lackner and Skowron (2021) to the standard setting and refining it to subclasses. In more detail, by relying on a consistency axiom for variable electorates, we characterize (i) the prominent class of Thiele rules and (ii) a new class of ABC voting rules called ballot size weighted approval voting. Based on these theorems, we also infer characterizations of three well-known ABC voting rules, namely multi-winner approval voting, proportional approval voting, and satisfaction approval voting.</description>
