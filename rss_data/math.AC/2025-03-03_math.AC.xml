      <title>Tangent Cones of Bresinsky and Arslan Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Apery tables for the numerical semigroups given by Bresinsky and Arslan. Using the Apery tables we write the tangent cones of the Bresinsky and Arsalan curves at the origin. Further, we calculate Hilbert series of the tangent cone of the Bresinsky and Arslan curves. We prove that both classes of the curve have Cohen- Macaulay tangent cone.</description>

      <title>A Fr\"{o}berg type theorem for higher secant complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the celebrated Fr\"{o}berg's theorem to embedded joins of copies of a simplicial complex, namely higher secant complexes to the simplicial complex, in terms of property $N_{q+1,p}$ due to Green and Lazarsfeld. Furthermore, we investigate combinatorial phenomena parallel to geometric ones observed for higher secant varieties of minimal degree.</description>

      <title>Fundamental algebraic sets and locally unit-additive rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be thought of as a statement about the real numbers as a space, considered as an algebraic set over the real numbers as a field. In this paper, I introduce what it means for an algebraic set or affine variety over a field to be fundamental, in a way that encompasses the classical case. I also introduce the related concept of local fundamentality and develop its behavior. On the algebraic side, I introduce the notions of locally, geometrically, and generically unit-additive rings, thus complementing unit-additivity as previously defined by myself and Jay Shapiro. I extend a number of results from the previous joint paper to local unit-additivity. I show that an affine variety is (locally) fundamental if and only if its coordinate ring is (locally) unit-additive. To do so, I first prove a theorem showing that there are many equivalent definitions of local unit-additivity. Illustrative examples are sprinkled throughout.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Multigraded Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multigraded Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of a module $M$ over the total coordinate ring $S$ of a smooth projective toric variety $X$ is a region $\operatorname{reg} M \subset \operatorname{Pic} X$ invariant under translation by the nef cone $\operatorname{Nef} X$. We prove that the multigraded regularity of a finitely generated faithful module is contained in a translate of $\operatorname{Nef} X$ determined by the degrees of the generators of $M$, and thus contains only finitely many minimal elements. We show that this condition can fail even for cyclic modules if $M$ has torsion and the rank of the Picard group is at least two.
  As an application, we exhibit asymptotic bounds for the multigraded regularity of powers of ideals. For $I$ an ideal in $S$, we bound $\operatorname{reg}(I^n)$ by proving that it contains a translate of $\operatorname{reg} S$ and is contained in a translate of $\operatorname{Nef} X$, where each bound translates by a fixed vector as $n$ increases.</description>

      <title>When do pseudo-Gorenstein rings become Gorenstein?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Cohen--Macaulay positively graded ring $R$, we say that $R$ is pseudo-Gorenstein if its leading coefficient is 1. In this paper, we study the relationship between canonical trace and pseudo-Gorensteinness for a graded ring. In particular, we show that if a nearly Gorenstein graded domain satisfies certain mild assumptions and is pseudo-Gorenstein, then it is necessarily Gorenstein. As an application, we clarify the relationships among nearly Gorensteinness, almost Gorensteinness, and levelness, which generalize the notion of Gorensteinness, in the context of standard graded domains. Moreover, we give a method for constructing quasi-Gorenstein rings by taking a Veronese subalgebra of certain Noetherian graded rings.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory for Finite Cluster Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Stanley-Reisner rings associated to cluster complexes for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras of geometric and finite cluster type. In particular, we show that in the skew-symmetric case, these cluster complexes are unobstructed, generalizing a result of Ilten and Christophersen in the $A_n$ case.
  We also study the connection between cluster algebras with universal coefficients and cluster complexes. We show that for a full rank positively graded cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ with universal coefficients may be recovered as the universal family over a partial closure of a torus orbit in a multigraded Hilbert scheme. Likewise, we show that under suitable hypotheses, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ may be recovered as the coordinate ring for a certain torus-invariant semiuniversal deformation of the Stanley-Reisner ring of the cluster complex.
  We apply these results to show that for any cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, $\mathcal{A}$ is Gorenstein, and $\mathcal{A}$ is unobstructed if it is skew-symmetric. Moreover, if $\mathcal{A}$ has enough frozen variables then it has no non-trivial torus-invariant deformations. We also study the Gr\"obner theory of the ideal of relations among cluster and frozen variables of $\mathcal{A}$. As a byproduct we generalize previous results in this setting obtained by Bossinger, Mohammadi and N\'ajera Ch\'avez for Grassmannians of planes and $\text{Gr}(3,6)$.</description>

      <title>On Matrix Algebras Isomorphic to Finite Fields and Planar Dembowski-Ostrom Monomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $n$ a positive integer. As the first main result, we present a deterministic algorithm for deciding whether the matrix algebra $\mathbb{F}_p[A_1,\dots,A_t]$ with $A_1,\dots,A_t \in \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}_p)$ is a finite field, performing at most $\mathcal{O}(tn^6\log(p))$ elementary operations in $\mathbb{F}_p$. In the affirmative case, the algorithm returns a defining element $a$ so that $\mathbb{F}_p[A_1,\dots,A_t] = \mathbb{F}_p[a]$.
  We then study an invariant for the extended-affine equivalence of Dembowski-Ostrom (DO) polynomials. More precisely, for a DO polynomial $g \in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}[x]$, we associate to $g$ a set of $n \times n$ matrices with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$, denoted $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$, that stays invariant up to matrix similarity when applying extended-affine equivalence transformations to $g$. In the case where $g$ is a planar DO polynomial, $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ is the set of quotients $XY^{-1}$ with $Y \neq 0,X$ being elements from the spread set of the corresponding commutative presemifield, and $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ forms a field of order $p^n$ if and only if $g$ is equivalent to the planar monomial $x^2$, i.e., if and only if the commutative presemifield associated to $g$ is isotopic to a finite field.
  As the second main result, we analyze the structure of $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ for all planar DO monomials, i.e., for commutative presemifields of odd order being isotopic to a finite field or a commutative twisted field. More precisely, for $g$ being equivalent to a planar DO monomial, we show that every non-zero element $X \in \mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ generates a field $\mathbb{F}_p[X] \subseteq \mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ and $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ contains the field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Bases in a Family of Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ that are bases is asymptotic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}(1-2^{-j}) \approx 0.29$ as $d \to \infty$. It is natural to ask whether there exists a (large) subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ such that the proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ that are bases is (asymptotically) greater than this number. As well as being a natural question in its own right, this would imply better lower bounds on the Tur\'an densities of certain hypercubes and `daisy' hypergraphs.
  We give a negative answer to the above question. More generally, we obtain an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the proportion of linearly independent $r$-element subsets of a (large) family of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$, for $r \leq d$. This bound follows from an exact result concerning the probability of obtaining a linearly independent sequence when we randomly sample $r$ elements with replacement from our family of vectors: we show that this probability, for any family of vectors, is at most what it is when the family is the whole space $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$. Our results also go through when $\mathbb{F}_2$ is replaced by $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$.</description>
