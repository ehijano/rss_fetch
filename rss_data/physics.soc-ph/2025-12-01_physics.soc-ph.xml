      <title>The Problem of Civil and Criminal Identification -- Bayesian Networks Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA evidence use in problems of civil and criminal identification is becoming greater. The necessity of evaluating the weight of that evidence may be accomplished using one of the most known powerful tools: the Bayesian networks. In the current paper this will be illustrated through the presentation of a civil identification problem and of a criminal identification problem.</description>

      <title>CompARE: A Computational framework for Airborne Respiratory disease Evaluation integrating flow physics and human behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The risk of indoor airborne transmission among co-located individuals is generally non-uniform, which remains a critical challenge for public health modelling. Thus, we present CompARE, an integrated risk assessment framework for indoor airborne disease transmission that reveals a striking bimodal distribution of infection risk driven by airflow dynamics and human behavior. Combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), machine learning (ML), and agent-based modeling (ABM), our model captures the complex interplay between aerosol transport, human mobility, and environmental context. Based on a prototypical childcare center, our approach quantifies how incorporation of ABM can unveil significantly different infection risk profiles across agents, with more than two-fold change in risk of infection between the individuals with the lowest and highest risks in more than 90% of cases, despite all individuals being in the same overall environment. We found that infection risk distributions can exhibit not only a striking bimodal pattern in certain activities but also exponential decay and fat-tailed behavior in others. Specifically, we identify low-risk modes arising from source containment, as well as high-risk tails from prolonged close contact. Our approach enables near-real-time scenario analysis and provides policy-relevant quantitative insights into how ventilation design, spatial layout, and social distancing policies can mitigate transmission risk. These findings challenge simple distance-based heuristics and support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions in high-occupancy indoor settings.</description>

      <title>NetworkGames: Simulating Cooperation in Network Games with Personality-driven LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a novel opportunity to build high-fidelity agent-based models for simulating complex social systems. However, the behavior of these LLM-based agents in game-theoretic network games remains surprisingly unexplored. In this work, we introduce "NetworkGames," a novel simulation framework designed to investigate how network topology and agent personality jointly shape the evolution of cooperation in network games. We instantiate a population of LLM agents, each endowed with a distinct personality from the MBTI taxonomy, and situate them in various network structures (e.g., small-world and scale-free). Through extensive simulations of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we first establish a baseline dyadic interaction matrix, revealing nuanced cooperative preferences between all 16 personality pairs. We then demonstrate that macro-level cooperative outcomes are not predictable from dyadic interactions alone; they are co-determined by the network's connectivity and the spatial distribution of personalities. For instance, we find that small-world networks are detrimental to cooperation, while strategically placing pro-social personalities in hub positions within scale-free networks can significantly promote cooperative behavior. Our findings offer significant implications for designing healthier online social environments and forecasting collective behavior. We open-source our framework to foster further research in network game simulations.</description>

      <title>Edge-based reputation promotes cooperation in simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists is a central challenge in the evolutionary dynamics of social and biological systems. Most prior studies have examined cooperation through pairwise interactions, yet real-world interactions often involve groups and higher-order structures. Reputation is a key mechanism for guiding strategic behavior in such contexts, but its role in higher-order networks remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce an edge-based reputation mechanism, incorporating both direct and indirect reputation, to investigate the evolution of cooperation in simplicial complexes. Our results show that coupling reputation mechanisms with higher-order network structures strongly promotes cooperation, with direct reputation exerting a stronger influence than indirect reputation. Moreover, we reveal a nonlinear interplay between network topology and reputation mechanisms, highlighting how multi-level structures shape collective outcomes. These findings provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding cooperation in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Can industrial overcapacity enable seasonal flexibility in electricity use? A case study of aluminum smelting in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many countries, declining demand in energy-intensive industries (EIIs) such as cement, steel, and aluminum is leading to industrial overcapacity. Although overcapacity is traditionally seen as problematic, it could unlock EIIs' flexibility in electricity use. Using China's aluminum smelting sector as a case, we evaluate the system-level cost-benefit of retaining EII overcapacity for flexible electricity use in decarbonized systems. We find that overcapacity enables smelters to adopt a seasonal operation paradigm, ceasing production during winter load peaks driven by heating electrification and renewable seasonality. In a 2050-net-zero scenario, this paradigm reduces China's electricity-system investment and operating costs by 15-72 billion CNY per year (8-34% of the industry's product value), enough to offset the costs of maintaining overcapacity and product storage. Seasonal operation also cuts workforce fluctuations across aluminum smelting and thermal-power sectors by up to 62%, potentially mitigating socio-economic disruptions from industrial restructuring and the energy transition.</description>

      <title>The impact of anticonformity on the diffusion of innovation -- insights from the q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticonformity, behaving in deliberate opposition to the group of influence, has long been recognized as a distinct social response, differing both from conformity and from independence. While often treated as a source of noise or contrarianism, anticonformity can play a constructive role in social dynamics by counterbalancing majority pressure and influencing collective outcomes. Recently, it was shown in laboratory experiments that evaluation may induce strategic anticonformity when rewards are anticipated. Moreover, using agent-based modeling, it has been demonstrated that anticonformity can depolarize highly polarized social groups and prevent social hysteresis. These findings encouraged us to extend the q-voter model with asymmetric independence, an agent-based model of the diffusion of innovation, by introducing anticonformity, so that agents can act independently, follow the group, or oppose it. Using a mean-field approximation (MFA), we investigate how these behavioral tendencies influence the diffusion of innovation. Our results show that anticonformists can accelerate early adoption and enable successful diffusion even in cases where diffusion would otherwise fail. The model exhibits two stable adoption levels separated by an unstable branch, giving rise to hysteresis and a critical mass effect. We also demonstrate that increasing independence lowers the threshold of anticonformity needed for widespread adoption. These results highlight how anticonformist behavior can facilitate innovation diffusion, with practical implications for decision-makers and policy design.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Spatial and Demographic Scales of Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities around the world exhibit residential segregation along ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, and other social divides. As high-resolution demographic and spatial data become widely available, decomposable measures have become essential tools for understanding the multi-scale structure of segregation. In this paper, we introduce a framework that quantifies how much segregation is expressed at different spatial and demographic scales. Extending existing spatial decompositions, our approach also measures the internal segregation of broad demographic groups, enabling a joint assessment of geographic and demographic structure. We illustrate the usefulness of this framework with a case study of ethnic residential segregation in England and Wales. Our methods provide a flexible, general tool for identifying the scales at which segregation operates and for guiding multi-scale models of urban systems.</description>

      <title>Who will import hydrogen in 2050? Global assessment with China and US case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses the global hydrogen import potential in 2050 by looking at the renewable hydrogen production potential in prospective import-oriented countries. Renewable energy potentials calculated with a GIS based model and 2050 primary energy consumption projections are used to identify candidate importers by comparing it with expected demand. Two approaches are applied: (1) a meta-analysis of literature on hydrogen production potential and demand for the identified countries, and (2) detailed regional analyses for the United States and China. The results suggest limited prospects for a fully global hydrogen market, although certain countries, such as Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, are likely to remain net importers. By contrast, many Asian countries have enough renewable resources to decarbonise their energy systems. China and the United States may follow divergent pathways: while the United States is well placed to meet its overall demand, using its own resources, it can still benefit from regional connections with neighbouring countries. China is facing strong demand in its eastern regions, so it may source cost-effective renewable hydrogen from foreign countries instead of relying solely on domestic production. Overall, the findings suggest that hydrogen trade will likely remain regionally concentrated, shaped by the interplay of renewable resource distribution, energy demand, other available hydrogen production pathways, and infrastructure constraints.</description>

      <title>Multilayer network science: theory, methods, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer network science has emerged as a central framework for analysing interconnected and interdependent complex systems. Its relevance has grown substantially with the increasing availability of rich, heterogeneous data, which makes it possible to uncover and exploit the inherently multilayered organisation of many real-world networks. In this review, we summarise recent developments in the field. On the theoretical and methodological front, we outline core concepts and survey advances in community detection, dynamical processes, temporal networks, higher-order interactions, and machine-learning-based approaches. On the application side, we discuss progress across diverse domains, including interdependent infrastructures, spreading dynamics, computational social science, economic and financial systems, ecological and climate networks, science-of-science studies, network medicine, and network neuroscience. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the need for standardized datasets and software, deeper integration of temporal and higher-order structures, and a transition toward genuinely predictive models of complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants.</description>

      <title>Displacement and disconnection: the impact of violence on migration networks and highway traffic in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how violence affects migration flows and, crucially, how it reshapes the strength of migration networks -- measured by the intensity of migration between areas, accounting for the fact that some routes become more prominent or fade over time -- an aspect traditional studies overlook. Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</description>

      <title>Collective communication in a transparent world: Phase transitions in a many-body Potts model and social-quantum duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digitally connected societies approach a \enquote{transparent} regime where all agents can interact without geographic or social barriers -- a limit realized by complete graph topologies. We solve exactly a $q$-state Potts model with many-body interactions on this geometry, modeling agents from $q$ distinct communities. Analyzing the illustrative case of competing pairwise and three-body couplings, we identify three key phases in the thermodynamic limit: democratic (all communities equal), marginalized ($q-1$ communities surviving), and consensus (one dominant group). For two-community systems, we identify a special coupling regime where interaction energies cancel, yielding purely entropy-driven dynamics -- a statistical physics representation of atomized societies without structured influence. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these phases and reveal metastable switching dynamics in finite systems. Furthermore, we establish an exact correspondence between this social model and mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin systems with quadratic and cubic Casimir interactions, revealing a \enquote{social-quantum} duality. This duality enables quantitative classification of social structures via Young diagrams and reinterprets quantum symmetry breaking as opinion stratification, bridging statistical sociology and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Recurrent visitations expose the paradox of human mobility in the 15-Minute City vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the transition towards sustainability and equity, proximity-centred planning has been adopted in cities worldwide. Exemplified by the 15-Minute City (15mC), this emerging planning paradigm assumes that proximate amenity translates into localised utilisation, yet evidence on actual mobility behaviour remains limited. We advance a behaviourally grounded assessment by introducing the \textit{K-Visitation} framework, which identifies the minimal set of distinct visitations needed to cover essential amenities under two orderings: one based on observed visitation frequency ($K_{\text{freq}}$), and the other based on proximity to home ($K_{\text{dist}}$). Applying it to an 18-month, anonymised mobility data from Finland containing 720 thousand users, we directly compared local mobility potentials with recurrent destination choices, revealing a paradox of human mobility within the 15mC framework. A clear misalignment is observed between proximity and recurrent behaviour, most pronounced in urban cores--areas boast with amenities and traditionally viewed as ideal settings for local living--where residents voluntarily overshoot nearest options, while peripheral routines remain more locally constrained. The paradox further revealed asymmetric functions influences, as compared with everyday amenities, individual travels significantly further for to encounter specialised functions. Furthermore, the social consequences of localism are spatially contingent: increased reliance on local options reduces experienced segregation in central districts but can exacerbate it elsewhere. Our findings stress that proximity is necessary but insufficient for achieving the proximity living ideal; implementation of the 15mC should be behaviourally informed and place-sensitive, coupling abundant local provision of routine needs with access enhancement to specialised amenities to avoid unintended equity trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Empirical validation of the polarization transition in a double-random field model of elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model bipartisan elections where voters are exposed to two forces: local homophilic interactions and external influence from two political campaigns. The model is mathematically equivalent to the random field Ising model with a bimodal field. When both parties exceed a critical campaign spending, the system undergoes a phase transition to a highly polarized state where homophilic influence becomes negligible, and election outcomes mirror the proportion of voters aligned with each campaign, independent of total spending. The model predicts a hysteresis region, where the election results are not determined by campaign spending but by incumbency. Calibrating the model with historical data from US House elections between 1980 and 2020, we find the critical campaign spending to be $\sim 1.8$ million USD. Campaigns exceeding critical expenditures increased in 2018 and 2020, suggesting a boost in political polarization.</description>

Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Opinion Dynamics with Application to Vaccine Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18166</link>

Abstract: Public health outcomes can be heavily influenced by the landscape of public opinion; hence, it is important to understand how that landscape changes over time. For one, opinions on public health issues are responsive to official pronouncements, whether from the governmental or professional medical establishments. Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of "influencers" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>
