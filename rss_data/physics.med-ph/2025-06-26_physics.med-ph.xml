      <title>Neural networks for the prediction of peel force for skin adhesive interface using FEM simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches. Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM), though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material design.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Radiotherapy Treatment Planning with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations, necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage, physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in RT planning.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 2. Phase-contrast tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, quantitative aspects of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging (PBI) were investigated using theoretical and numerical approaches, as well as experimental two-dimensional PBI images collected with plane monochromatic X-rays at a synchrotron beamline. In this second part, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution and contrast are studied in connection with the radiation dose in three-dimensional PBI images of breast tissue samples obtained using propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PB-CT) with energy-integrating and photon-counting detectors. The analysis is based on the theory of PBI and PB-CT using the homogeneous Transport of Intensity equation (Paganin's method). A biomedical image quality characteristic, suitable for quantitative assessment of X-ray images of biological samples, is introduced and applied. The key factors leading to high values of the biomedical imaging quality in PBI and to relatively low values of the same quality metric in CT imaging are identified and discussed in detail. This study is aimed primarily at developing tools for quantitative assessment and optimization of medical PB-CT imaging, initially at synchrotron facilities, with the prospect of subsequent transfer of the technology to medical clinics.</description>

      <title>Do cell culturing influence the radiosensitizing effect of gold nanoparticles part 2: scrutinizing the methodology producing recent evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When irradiation is performed with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a different shape of cells in suspension or adherent to walls may result in different probability of cell survival. In a recent study, differences of up to a factor of 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells. The present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup and the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model for cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near the surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in dose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells deeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam dimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon interactions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a factor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose in voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the local effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions from a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an overestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival rate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation, for which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by more than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The results show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the concentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles and thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction in cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the LEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Point Cloud Diffusion Model for Deformable Liver Motion Tracking Via a Single Arbitrarily-Angled X-ray Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformable liver motion tracking using a single X-ray projection enables real-time motion monitoring and treatment intervention. We introduce a conditional point cloud diffusion model-based framework for accurate and robust liver motion tracking from arbitrarily angled single X-ray projections (PCD-Liver), which estimates volumetric liver motion by solving deformable vector fields (DVFs) of a prior liver surface point cloud based on a single X-ray image. The model is patient-specific and consists of two main components: a rigid alignment model to estimate the liver's overall shifts and a conditional point cloud diffusion model that further corrects for liver surface deformations. Conditioned on motion-encoded features extracted from a single X-ray projection via a geometry-informed feature pooling layer, the diffusion model iteratively solves detailed liver surface DVFs in a projection angle-agnostic manner. The liver surface motion estimated by PCD-Liver serves as a boundary condition for a U-Net-based biomechanical model to infer internal liver motion and localize liver tumors. A dataset of ten liver cancer patients was used for evaluation. The accuracy of liver point cloud motion estimation was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), while liver tumor localization error was quantified using center-of-mass error (COME). The mean (standard deviation) RMSE, HD95, and COME of the prior liver or tumor before motion estimation were 8.82(3.58) mm, 10.84(4.55) mm, and 9.72(4.34) mm, respectively. After PCD-Liver motion estimation, the corresponding values improved to 3.63(1.88) mm, 4.29(1.75) mm, and 3.46(2.15) mm. Under highly noisy conditions, PCD-Liver maintained stable performance. This study presents an accurate and robust framework for deformable liver motion estimation and tumor localization in image-guided radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\sigma$-LEM) to predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that the number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume $V_{\mathrm{NP}} \propto R^{3}$ and that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally distributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as $D_{\text{enh}} = D_{0} \exp(\sigma Z)$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width $\sigma = \sqrt{2 \ln(1 + Kc)}$.
  By assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between survival and dose can be derived for each voxel. Although there is no closed form for the log-normal distribution, averaging over the entire domain using first and second order moments leads to three possible closed forms: a variance-only one, a mixed-term one, where simultaneous hits from enhancement and baseline can occur, and a second-order model, accurate to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{3})$. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration, mid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.
  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results, irradiated with a 100 kVp x-ray beam, taken from a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data, with deviations within acceptable limits, but presents significant changes to the results obtained with the LEM. In particular, results seem to indicate that dose enhancement is mostly $\alpha$-driven. These findings are further developed in the manuscript.
  The theoretical framework presented here collapses radiobiological outcomes to two experimentally controllable variables, beam quality, in the term $K_c$, and intracellular concentration $c$, while retaining mechanistic fidelity. Additional tests should be made to further confirm the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>The role of dendritic spines in water exchange measurements with diffusion MRI: Time-Dependent Single Diffusion Encoding MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) with single diffusion encoding (SDE) probes water dynamics in biological tissues, but signal interpretation depends on microstructure. While prior work focused on restricted/hindered diffusion and membrane permeation, diffusion-mediated exchange between dendritic shafts and spines in gray matter (GM) remains understudied. We hypothesize that impermeable spiny dendrites produce time-dependent SDE signals mimicking permeative exchange and investigate how spine density biases exchange time estimates.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and narrow escape theory, we quantify spine-shaft exchange times (3-26 ms), matching cortical permeative exchange estimates. A modified two-compartment Karger model characterizes time-dependent SDE signals but yields biased exchange estimates, reflecting spine volume fraction rather than morphology. Unaccounted diffusion-mediated exchange introduces up to 80% bias in NEXI/SMEX model estimates. We propose an extended three-compartment Karger model incorporating both diffusion-mediated (spine-shaft) and permeative (intra-extracellular) exchange. However, this model cannot uniquely separate membrane permeability from spine volume effects.
  Our findings emphasize that dendritic spines should be considered in SDE-based exchange studies and caution against attributing exchange solely to permeability. Advanced methods are needed to disentangle these mechanisms in GM.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which are translated into a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. Using a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma -- to the characteristics of the evolving signal. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>
