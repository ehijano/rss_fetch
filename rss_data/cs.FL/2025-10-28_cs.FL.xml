      <title>Synthesis of State-Attack Strategies for Anonymity and Opacity Violation in Discrete Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attacks, including the manipulation of sensor readings and the modification of actuator commands, pose a significant challenge to the security and privacy of automated systems. This paper considers discrete event systems that can be modeled with nondeterministic finite state automata that are susceptible to state attacks. A state attack allows an intruder to learn whether or not the current state of a system falls into certain subsets of states. The intruder has a limited total number of state attacks at its disposal, but can launch state attacks at arbitrary instants of its choosing. We are interested on violations of current-state anonymity (resp. opacity), i.e., situations where the intruder, based on the sequence of observations generated by the system and the outcome of any performed state attacks, can ascertain the exact current state of the system (resp. that the current state of the system definitely resides in a subset of secret states). When the system violates current-state anonymity (resp. opacity) under a bounded number of state attacks, a subsequent question is whether the intruder can design an attack strategy such that anonymity-violating (resp. opacity-violating) situations will always be reached. In this latter case, we also design an attack strategy that guarantees that the system will reach a violating situation regardless of system actions. We provide pertinent complexity analysis of the corresponding verification algorithms and examples to illustrate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI and the Chomsky Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of enumerating the answers to a query formulated in monadic second order logic (MSO) over an unranked forest F that is compressed by a straight-line program (SLP) D. Our main result states that this can be done after O(|D|) preprocessing and with output-linear delay (in data complexity). This is a substantial improvement over the previously known algorithms for MSO-evaluation over trees, since the compressed size |D| might be much smaller than (or even logarithmic in) the actual data size |F|, and there are linear time SLP-compressors that yield very good compressions on practical inputs. In particular, this also constitutes a meta-theorem in the field of algorithmics on SLP-compressed inputs: all enumeration problems on trees or strings that can be formulated in MSO-logic can be solved with linear preprocessing and output-linear delay, even if the inputs are compressed by SLPs. We also show that our approach can support vertex relabelling updates in time that is logarithmic in the uncompressed data. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Closure of Matrix Sets Recognized by 1-VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known how to compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated monoid of matrices and, more generally, of a set of matrices specified by a regular language. This result was recently used to give a procedure to compute all polynomial invariants of a given affine program. Decidability of the more general problem of computing all polynomial invariants of affine programs with recursive procedure calls remains open. Mathematically speaking, the core challenge is to compute the Zariski closure of a set of matrices defined by a context-free language. In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides: Towards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of sets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by one-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper subclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem becomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free languages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical tools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite monoids of matrices.</description>

      <title>Formal Analysis of the Contract Automata Runtime Environment with Uppaal: Modelling, Verification and Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a distributed middleware application called contract automata runtime environment (CARE) has been introduced to realise service applications specified using a dialect of finite-state automata. In this paper, we detail the formal modelling, verification and testing of CARE. We provide a formalisation as a network of stochastic timed automata. The model is verified against the desired properties with the tool Uppaal, utilising exhaustive and statistical model checking techniques. Abstract tests are generated from the Uppaal models that are concretised for testing CARE. This research emphasises the advantages of employing formal modelling, verification and testing processes to enhance the dependability of an open-source distributed application. We discuss the methodology used for modelling the application and generating concrete tests from the abstract model, addressing the issues that have been identified and fixed.</description>

      <title>Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</description>
