      <title>On the Novel Superfluidity in the Second Layer of $^4$He on Graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for a new type of superfluid phase in second-layer $^4$He on graphite has been obtained from simultaneous measurements of torsional-oscillator response and heat-capacity on exactly the same sample down to 30 mK, which resolve substrate-related uncertainties in the previous studies. The new phase hosts both superfluidity and enhanced viscoelasticity, and is stable over a finite density interval, strongly supporting the proposed superfluid liquid-crystal hypothesis. A random-Josephson-network analysis shows that the widely reported log-$T$ dependence of the superfluid density is likely due to substrate imperfections.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of excitons and carriers in mixed-cation MA$_{x}$FA$_{1-x}$PbI$_{3}$ perovskite crystals: alloy fluctuations probed by optical orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spin orientation measured by time-resolved photoluminescence provides a powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics of excitons and charge carriers in perovskite semiconductors. The impact of alloy fluctuations on the spin dynamics of mixed-cation \MAFAPI{} perovskite single crystals is studied here experimentally. The optical orientation is measured under nonresonant excitation for crystals with $x = 0.1$, $0.4$, and $0.8$ at cryogenic temperatures and compared with data on \MAPI{} crystals. The high degree of exciton optical orientation of $75-80$\% for $x = 0.1$ and $0.8$ reduces to about 60\% for $x = 0.4$. A similar trend is observed for the carrier spin optical orientation. This behavior is attributed to enhanced scattering of free excitons and carriers in the alloys with increased compositional and structural disorder. From the Larmor spin precession measured from spin dynamics in an external magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry, the electron and hole $g$-factors are evaluated. Their dependence on the band gap energy in \MAFAPI{} crystals follows the universal trend previously established for lead halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue that the scattering dynamics can be probed experimentally with a real-time measurement protocol using inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. Our work introduces a systematic way to determine the many-body effective theory for edge states in topological magnon insulators.</description>

      <title>Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and show its optimality for observables with a large trace-norm, including Pauli and local observables, closing a gap in the literature. For these observables, ORM admits an efficient implementation with Clifford circuits. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows. Additionally, we introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for multiple low-rank non-linear observables, reducing circuit complexities in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.</description>
