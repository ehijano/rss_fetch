      <title>Inverse Kinematics for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator Using Comprehensive Gr\"obner Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments.</description>

      <title>An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.</description>

      <title>Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.</description>

      <title>ViSymRe: Vision-guided Multimodal Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting simple mathematical expression from an observational dataset to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core objectives of artificial intelligence (AI). This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.</description>

      <title>APEX$^2$: Adaptive and Extreme Summarization for Personalized Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts, serve various applications. Recently, personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) have emerged as a solution to optimize storage costs by customizing their content to align with users' specific interests within particular domains. In the real world, on one hand, user queries and their underlying interests are inherently evolving, requiring PKGs to adapt continuously; on the other hand, the summarization is constantly expected to be as small as possible in terms of storage cost. However, the existing PKG summarization methods implicitly assume that the user's interests are constant and do not shift. Furthermore, when the size constraint of PKG is extremely small, the existing methods cannot distinguish which facts are more of immediate interest and guarantee the utility of the summarized PKG. To address these limitations, we propose APEX$^2$, a highly scalable PKG summarization framework designed with robust theoretical guarantees to excel in adaptive summarization tasks with extremely small size constraints. To be specific, after constructing an initial PKG, APEX$^2$ continuously tracks the interest shift and adjusts the previous summary. We evaluate APEX$^2$ under an evolving query setting on benchmark KGs containing up to 12 million triples, summarizing with compression ratios $\leq 0.1\%$. The experiments show that APEX outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both query-answering accuracy and efficiency.

      <title>Dynamic Symbolic Execution for Semantic Difference Analysis of Component and Connector Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of model-driven development, ensuring the correctness and consistency of evolving models is paramount. This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</description>
