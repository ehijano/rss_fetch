      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation for a Dynamic Metasurface Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most use cases of reconfigurable antennas require an accurate forward model mapping configuration to radiated field (and reflections at feeds). Emerging dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) confront the conventional approach of extracting such a model from a numerical simulation with multiple challenges. First, the cost of accurately simulating an intricate and electrically large DMA architecture might be prohibitive. Second, the model-reality mismatch due to fabrication inaccuracies might be substantial, especially at higher frequencies and for DMA architectures leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) to maximize their tunability. These considerations motivate an experimental parameter estimation for DMA forward models. The main challenge lies in the forward model's non-linearity due to inter-element MC. Multiport network theory (MNT) can accurately capture MC but the MC parameters cannot be measured directly. In this article, we demonstrate the experimental estimation of a high-accuracy proxy MNT model for a 19-GHz DMA with 7 feeds and 96 elements, where all feeds and elements are strongly coupled via a chaotic cavity. For a given DMA configuration and excitation, our proxy MNT model predicts the reflected field at the feeds and the radiated field with accuracies of 40.3 dB and 37.7 dB, respectively. A simpler, MC-unaware benchmark model only achieves 2.6 dB and 3.3 dB, respectively. We systematically examine the influence of the number of feeds and measured DMA configurations on the model accuracy, motivating the inclusion of "auxiliary calibration feeds" to facilitate the parameter estimation when the intended DMA operation is limited to a single feed. Finally, we measure DMA configurations optimized based on our proxy MNT model.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Octave Bandwidth Rectifier for Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents the design and implementation of a compact high-efficiency octave microwave rectifier. A key highlight is the novel segmented impedance matching method, a unique approach that expands the rectifier bandwidth. The diode reactance is initially regulated by a series short-ended microstrip line. Impedance-compensated structures, characterized by varying admittance properties across an extensive frequency range, partition the operating frequency band into two segments based on the input impedance, thereby minimizing impedance variation. Ultimately, the input impedance is matched by a novel triple-band matching network. An octave rectifier was fabricated and measured. Results demonstrate that the rectifier achieves over 50% efficiency over 1.3-2.55 GHz fractional bandwidth 64.9% at 0-dBm RF input power. Even with a decrease in input power to -10 dBm, the rectifier maintains over 30% efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Fusion Graph Network for 3D Strain Field Prediction in Solid Rocket Motor Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local high strain in solid rocket motor grains is a primary cause of structural failure. However, traditional numerical simulations are computationally expensive, and existing surrogate models cannot explicitly establish geometric models and accurately capture high-strain regions. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive graph network, GrainGNet, which employs an adaptive pooling dynamic node selection mechanism to effectively preserve the key mechanical features of structurally critical regions, while concurrently utilising feature fusion to transmit deep features and enhance the model's representational capacity. In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety.</description>

      <title>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</description>

      <title>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</description>

      <title>Toward reducing the formation temperature of diopside via wet-chemical synthesis routes using chloride precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Stacking Optimization Using Dirichlet's Process (SoDip): Towards Accelerated Design for Graft Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.</description>

      <title>Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir &gt; U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Like Environmental Enhancement of Classical Antennas: Self and Transfer Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental 'range boosts' in wireless links are often explained through radiation-pattern intuition, yet the underlying physics is more cleanly captured by two environment-controlled quantities: radiative damping of the radiator and \emph{channel coupling} between transmitter and receiver. Building from a dyadic-Green-function current--field formulation, we introduce an operational two-factor description of Purcell-like behavior for classical antennas. A \emph{self} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in radiative damping under an explicit excitation convention, while a \emph{transfer} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in Tx--Rx coupling. We provide measurement-aware extraction workflows (VNA $S_{11}\!\rightarrow Z_{\mathrm{in}}$ with efficiency and realized-gain accounting; link-test normalization to isolate $F_{\mathrm{tr}}$) and falsification diagnostics that prevent conflating true radiative enhancement with mismatch or added absorption. Finally, we translate self/transfer modifications into link-budget and range scalings and illustrate the framework across practical environments from VHF to mmWave, including platforms/ground planes, body proximity, field-expedient environmental radiators, terrain and passive redirection, tunnel/canyon confinement, and engineered scattering environments such as reflectarrays, metasurfaces, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS).</description>

      <title>Operational entanglement of collective quantum modes at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be fragile at ambient temperature and over macroscopic distances, where thermal noise and dissipation are expected to rapidly suppress nonclassical correlations. Here we show that this intuition fails for collective quantum modes whose dynamics is governed by reduced open-system channels rather than by microscopic thermal equilibrium. For two spatially separated collective modes, we derive an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, valid in the symmetric resonant limit. From this result we obtain an explicit minimum collective fluctuation amplitude, expressed entirely in measurable noise, bandwidth, dissipation, and distance-dependent coupling parameters, required to sustain steady-state entanglement at finite temperature. We further show that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, so the steady state remains phase symmetric and does not collapse to a classical mean-field despite macroscopic signal amplitudes. Stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, together with matched classical correlated-noise null models analyzed through an identical pipeline, confirm that entanglement witnesses are violated only in the quantum regime. Our results establish a minimal, platform-independent framework connecting collective-mode dynamics, noise injection, distance, and operational certification of macroscopic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Architecture of Living Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.
  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.</description>

      <title>Full-bandwidth, continuous, and grayscale 3D nanolithography via line-illumination temporal focusing of ultrafast lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving fast and continuous fabrication of large-scale complex 3D structures is key to unlocking industrial-scale adoption of two-photon lithography (TPL). Despite substantial improvement in peak optical patterning rates enabled by recent parallel exposure strategies, the practical fabrication rate of TPL for large structures remains low. This gap is primarily attributed to the mismatched bandwidth among toolpath generation, data transferring, and laser patterning, and the stop-and-go operation for part stitching etc. Here, we present a line-illumination temporal focusing TPL (Line-TF TPL) solution that, for the first time, demonstrates true continuous 3D nanolithography with full-bandwidth data streaming, grayscale voxel tuning, and cost-effective large-scale fabrication capability. To achieve the goal, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to temporally focus femtosecond laser pulses into a programmable line with enhanced 3D resolution, pixel-level grayscale control, and a high-refresh rate (&gt;10 kHz), realizing continuous fabrication at a hardware-limited maximum rate. Specifically, we fabricated centimeter-scale 3D structures with sub-diffraction features down to 75 nm laterally and 99 nm axially. Our method eliminates stitching defects by continuous scanning and grayscale stitching; and provides real-time pattern streaming at a bandwidth that is one order of magnitude higher than previous TPL systems. The line-scanning strategy also substantially lowers the pulse-energy requirement, hence the cost for parallel TPL; and maximizes the machine uptime through continuous operation, both of which are critical metrics for industrialization. Finally, we demonstrated centimeter-scale artworks, fine 3D features, and complex miniaturized optics, revealing the Line-TF TPL's large-scale application potential in photonic packaging, metamaterial discovery, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Superconductor Shift Registers with Energy Dissipation Below Landauer's Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs.</description>

      <title>A NEAT Approach to Evolving Neural-Network-based Optimization of Chiral Photonic Metasurfaces: Application of a Neuro-Evolution Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of chiral metasurfaces with tailored optical properties remains a central challenge in nanophotonics due to the highly nonlinear relationship between geometry and chiroptical response. Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Exploring phase transitions and thermal dynamics in nanoconfined liquid crystals using liquid-phase TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoconfined liquid crystals (LCs) and their nanocomposites are driving the next generation of photonic applications. Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research.</description>

      <title>High-resolution 3D-printed plastic scintillators with tertiary dye</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing offers efficient production of plastic scintillators with nontrivial geometries using vat polymerization, allowing fabrication of geometries which would be difficult or even impossible to produce using conventional subtractive manufacturing. This work presents a novel photocurable scintillator formula that includes coumarin 450 as a tertiary dye to enable high-resolution 3D printing via the manipulation of the 405 nm cure light. Bulk photocured and 3D printed (with and without tertiary dye) samples were compared through observational assessment and spectral response. All samples showed pulse shape discrimination between neutron and gamma events. Inclusion of the tertiary dye has minimal impact on emission spectrum and light output, but significant impact on print resolution as shown by comparison of printed high-complexity geometries and feature resolution test objects. With the use of a cure-limiting dye, unsupported features, such as freestanding pillars, were resolvable down to 0.7 mm. Even finer resolution at or below 0.1 mm was achieved in fully supported, integrated structures printed with off-the-shelf 405 nm desktop 3D printer. Scintillators demonstrated a light output up to 50% of EJ-200 with a PSD figure of merit up to 1.35 at 0.9-1.1 MeVee.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Device and Circuit Modeling: A Case Study of NeuroSPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.</description>

      <title>Stark Tuning and Charge State Control in Individual Telecom C-Band Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>
