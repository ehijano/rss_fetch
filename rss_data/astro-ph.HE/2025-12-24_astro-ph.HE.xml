      <title>New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the Energy Spectrum of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Using Pierre Auger Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct the energy spectrum of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays using the publicly released Pierre Auger Observatory data set. Since event-level Monte Carlo truth information is not included in the open data, we develop a consistent procedure to regenerate a pseudo-Monte Carlo sample directly from the published quantities: the registered event counts $N$, the unfolded spectrum $N_\mathrm{corr}$, and the detector response matrix $R_{ij}$ from the Auger 2020 spectrum data analysis. Using the row-normalized response matrix and the published unfolded spectrum as a truth prior, we construct an absolute-level migration matrix and generate the event-by-event truth and reconstructed-level pairs by drawing from a two-dimensional probability distribution function. The resulting sample statistically replicates the detector response properties of the Pierre Auger Surface Detector. This pseudo-MC sample allows for the application of classical unfolding techniques (bin-by-bin and iterative Bayesian unfolding via RooUnfold) as well as a machine-learning-based unfolding using OmniFold. We demonstrate that using such publicly available information this approach allows the full unfolding procedure.</description>

      <title>Double-hump spectrum, pulse profile dip, and pulsed fraction spectra from the low-accretion regime in the X-ray pulsar MAXI J0655-013</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting X-ray pulsars (XRPs) undergo different physical regimes depending on the mass accretion rate. Recent observations have shown a dramatic change in the emission properties of this class of sources observed at low luminosity. We explore the timing and spectral properties of the XRP MAXI J0655-013 observed in the low-luminosity regime (about 5x$10^{33}$ erg/s) to witness the corresponding spectral shape and pulse profiles. We employ recent $XMM$ and $NuSTAR$ pointed observations of the MAXI J0655-013 X-ray activity during the low-luminosity stage. We explore several spectral models to fit the data and test theoretical expectations of the dramatic transition of the spectral shape. We study the pulsating nature of the source and find a phase-connected timing solution. We explore the energy-resolved pulse profiles and the derived energy-dependence of different pulsed fraction estimators ($PF_{minmax}$ and $PF_{rms}$). We also obtain $NuSTAR$ pulsed fraction spectra (PFS) at different luminosity regimes. MAXI J0655-013 spectrum is well fitted by a double Comptonization model, in agreement with recent observational results and theoretical expectations that explain the observed spectrum as being composed of two distinct bumps, each dominated by different polarization modes. We measure a spin period of $1081.86\pm0.02$ s, consistent with the source spinning-up compared to previous observations, yielding an upper limit for the magnetic field strength of B&lt;9x$10^{13}$ G. The pulse profiles show a single broad peak interrupted by a sharp dip that coincides with an increase in the hardness ratio. For the low-luminosity observation, the $PF_{minmax}$ increases with energy up to $\sim100\%$ in the 10-30 keV band, while the $PF_{rms}$ remains steady at $\sim60\%$. The PFS obtained at high luminosity shows evidence of an iron $K\alpha$ emission line but no indications of a cyclotron line.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on the cold equation of state of the strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, the only experimental access to the properties of cold, dense strongly interacting matter is provided by astrophysical observations. Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Accretion through a Multiwavelength Lens: Searching for Counterparts of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) represent the closest and most accessible laboratories to study sustained super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects. Over the past decade, the discoveries of coherent pulsations in a few ULXs has proved that these systems can be powered by accreting neutron stars, while the most luminous and distant ones remain strong candidates for hosting intermediate-mass black holes. Despite the increasing number of available X-ray data and the significant progress in theoretical modeling and simulations, our understanding of ULXs remains incomplete. Key open questions include the nature and mass distribution of the compact objects, the type of the donor stars, the geometry of the accretion disc and its contribution to the observed broadband emission, the mechanisms responsible for the wide spectral and temporal phenomenology, the duration of the super-Eddington accretion phase and its feedback on the host-galaxy environment. Future ground-based facilities will play a crucial role in addressing these issues.</description>

      <title>The Indian Pulsar Timing Array Data Release 2: II. Customised Single-Pulsar Noise Analysis and Noise Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of customised single-pulsar noise analysis of 27 millisecond pulsars from the second data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA-DR2). We model various stochastic noise sources present in the dataset using stationary Gaussian processes and estimate the noise budget of the InPTA-DR2 using Bayesian inference, involving model selection, Fourier harmonics selection, and parameter estimation for each pulsar. We check the efficacy of our noise characterisation by performing the Anderson-Darling test for Gaussianity on the noise-subtracted residuals. We find that all 11 pulsars with time baseline $\lesssim2.5\,\text{yr}$ show Gaussian residuals and do not have evidence for any red noise process in the optimal model, except for PSR J1944$+$0907, which shows presence of DM noise. PSRs J0437$-$4715, J1909$-$3744 and J1939$+$2134 show preference for the most complicated noise model, having achromatic and chromatic red noise processes. Only 4 out of 15 pulsars with time baseline $\gtrsim2.5\,\text{yr}$ show significant non-Gaussianity in noise-subtracted residuals. We suspect that this may require more advanced methods to model noise processes properly. A comparative study of six pulsars with data removed near solar conjunctions showed deviations from the parameter estimates obtained with the original dataset, indicating potential bias in red noise processes due to unmodeled solar-wind effects. The results presented in this work remain broadly consistent with the InPTA-DR1 noise budget, with better constraints obtained on noise processes for several pulsars and support for achromatic red noise in PSR J1012$+$5307 due to the extended time baseline.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of PUEO to Cosmogenic Neutrinos and Exotic Physics Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several observatories designed to detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos are planned for the next decade. The most imminent of these is the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO), a long-duration balloon-based experiment that will provide unprecedented sensitivity to neutrinos with energies in the range of ~ 1 - 1000 EeV. In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a constraint on the speed of sound, $c_s^2$, derived from relativistic kinetic theory and show how it can be expressed in terms of the average sound speed, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle$. This reformulation highlights the interplay between instantaneous and integrated stiffness of the equation of state and allows the kinetic-theory bound to be visualized as a restriction in the $c_s^2$-$\langle c_s^2 \rangle $ plane.</description>

      <title>SN 2025ogs: A Spectroscopically-Normal Type Ia Supernova at z = 2 as a Benchmark for Redshift Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a revolutionary measurement of the Universe's expansion kinematics, driven by dark matter and dark energy, out to $z \approx 3$. The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe ($z \gtrsim 1.5$), with its effects becoming more easily distinguishable from dark energy variation at increasing redshift. We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at $z = 2.05 \pm 0.01$. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color ($B - V = -0.27 \pm 0.06$ mag) and a moderately fast decline ($\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.55 \pm 0.15$ mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in $1.0\sigma$ agreement with a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&amp;K, O I $\lambda7774$, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-$z$ SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at $z \approx 2$, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model anisotropic neutron stars using three distinct prescriptions for pressure anisotropy, the Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and Covariant models, and three equations of state with different particle compositions, each described by a piecewise polytropic parametrization with continuous sound speed. The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state.</description>

      <title>Stable mass transfer in massive binaries leading to merging black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of massive binary systems in the universe is evidently unsuited to produce merging binary black holes. However, several narrow evolutionary paths of isolated massive binaries towards this goal have recently been identified. Due to the high degree of simplification and assumptions applied in previous modelling of these paths, conclusions remained vague so far. For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10--25$M_\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Formation of an optically thick shocked shell in the very fast nova V1674 Herculis: the origin of superbrightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V1674 Her is the fastest ($t_2\sim 1$ day) classical nova in our Galaxy and its absolute $V$ peak of $M_{V,\rm max}\sim -10.2$ is one magnitude brighter than typical very fast novae. Such a nova is sometimes called a superbright nova. Using our fully self-consistent nova outburst model combined with the optically thick winds on a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) with a mass accretion rate of $1\times 10^{-11} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we have clarified that a strong reverse shock arises $0.3$ days after the outburst, which is just after the maximum expansion of the WD photosphere. The shocked shell is optically thick and expanding with the velocity of $\sim 3500$ km~s$^{-1}$. Its $V$ brightness reaches maximum of $M_{V,\rm max}=-10.2$ when the shocked shell expands to $R_{\rm shell}\sim 300 ~R_\odot$ on day $\sim 0.7$. After that, the shocked shell turns to optically thin and becomes fainter than the brightness of free-free emission from the nova wind. In chronological order, the optical brightness of free-free emission reaches maximum of $M_V=-9$ on day 0.3. However, it is overtaken on day 0.5--0.7 by the $\sim$1 mag brighter luminosity of the optically thick shocked shell. The GeV gamma-ray flux reaches maximum on day 0.4 because the gamma-rays are emitted by the shock that arises on day 0.3. Our model consistently explains both the superbrightness and chronological order that the gamma-ray peak precedes substantially before the optical $V$ peak. We also present a similar light curve model for another superbright nova V1500 Cyg.</description>

      <title>A Young Supernova Selection Pipeline For The LSST Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early-time spectroscopy of supernovae (SNe), acquired within days of explosion, yields crucial insights into their outermost ejecta layers, facilitating the study of their environments, progenitor systems, and explosion mechanisms. Recent efforts in early discovery and follow-up of SNe have shown the potential insights that can be gained from early-time spectra. Surveys such as the Time-Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES), conducted with the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), will provide spectroscopic follow-up of transients discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Current simulations indicate that early-time spectroscopic studies conducted with TiDES data will be limited by the current SN selection criteria. To enhance early-time SN spectroscopic studies from TiDES-like surveys, we propose a set of selection criteria focusing on young SNe (YSNe), which we define as SNe prior to -10 days before peak brightness. Utilising the Zwicky Transient Facility transient alerts, we developed criteria to select YSNe while minimising the sample's contamination rate to 23 percent. The developed criteria were applied to LSST simulations, yielding a sample of 694 Deep Drilling Field survey SNe and 56,260 Wide Fast Deep survey SNe for follow-up. We demonstrate that our criteria enables the selection of SNe at early-times, enhancing future early-time spectroscopic SN studies from TiDES-like surveys. Finally, we investigated 4MOST-like observing strategies to increase the sample of spectroscopically observed YSNe. We propose that a 4MOST-like observing strategy that follows LSST with a delay of 3 days is optimal for a TiDES-like SN survey in terms of the number of classifiable spectra obtained, while a 1 day delay is most optimal for enhancing the early-time science in conjunction with our YSN selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring Precession Modulates Repeated Lensing of Continues Gravitational Wave Source from AGN Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) offers a novel observational channel that complements traditional electromagnetic approaches and provides unique insights into the astrophysical environments of GW sources. In this work, we investigate the repeated lensing of continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on the imprint of SMBH spin via the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect. Although typically weak and challenging to observe, the spin-induced precession of source orbits can accumulate over time, thereby modulating the lensing geometry. Such modulations influence the magnification, duration, and waveform structure of each repeated lensing event, and enhance the overall probability of lensing occurrences. Using matched filtering, we demonstrate that spin-dependent signatures may be detectable, suggesting that lensed CW signals could serve as an indirect probe of SMBH spin in AGNs.</description>

      <title>Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB20240114A showed an exceptionally high burst rate. During a continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width. Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The explosion jets of the core-collapse supernova remnant Circinus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the recently analyzed opposite rings in the Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant resulted from a pair of opposite jets at the final phases of the jet-driven explosion process of the progenitor of Cir X-1. We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary system Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus Loop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets associated with the explosion process, within the framework of the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1, which we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar core, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The Cir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop and to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1. Based on these similarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the Cir X-1 nebula, consistent with an earlier claim regarding the formation of the blowout of the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM is a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants.</description>

      <title>Hurst Index of Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves and Its Statistical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines. In this work, we analyze a sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and moderate positive correlations with peak photon flux proxies (P_{pk1}--P_{pk3}). In contrast, correlations between the Hurst index and standard spectral parameters (including the low-energy index \alpha) are weak in our sample. We do not find a clear monotonic weakening of the correlation strength from 64 ms to 1024 ms peak-flux measures; rather, the correlation coefficients for P_{pk1}--P_{pk3} are comparable within uncertainties. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.</description>

      <title>Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22843v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</description>

      <title>A fast powerful X-ray transient from possible tidal disruption of a white dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be torn apart by strong tidal forces, producing electromagnetic flares. To date, more than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, each involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH, sustaining the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs), which are the most prevalent compact stars and a million times denser--and therefore tougher--than gaseous stars, can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2--10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are considered to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast and luminous X-ray transient EP250702a detected by Einstein Probe. Its one-day-long X-ray peak as luminous as 10^(47-49) erg/s showed strong recurrent flares with hard spectra extending to several tens of MeV gamma-rays, as detected by Fermi/GBM and Konus-Wind, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet's X-ray dropped sharply from 3 x 10^49 erg/s to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days (10 days in the source rest frame). These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving over an unprecedentedly short timescale, indicating the disruption of a WD by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting an extreme super-Eddington luminosity, which possibly originates from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window for investigating the elusive IMBHs and their surrounding stellar environments, and they are prime sources of gravitational waves in the band of space-based interferometers.</description>

Abstract: We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available to the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the pair number density, the average energy per pair, and the pair energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>
