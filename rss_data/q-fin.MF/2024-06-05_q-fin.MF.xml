      <title>Mean field equilibrium asset pricing model with habit formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an asset pricing model in an incomplete market involving a large number of heterogeneous agents based on the mean field game theory. In the model, we incorporate habit formation in consumption preferences, which has been widely used to explain various phenomena in financial economics. In order to characterize the market-clearing equilibrium, we derive a quadratic-growth mean field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) and study its well-posedness and asymptotic behavior in the large population limit. Additionally, we introduce an exponential quadratic Gaussian reformulation of the asset pricing model, in which the solution is obtained in a semi-analytic form.</description>

      <title>Pricing and calibration in the 4-factor path-dependent volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the path-dependent volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023), where the instantaneous volatility is a linear combination of a weighted sum of past returns and the square root of a weighted sum of past squared returns. We discuss the influence of an additional parameter that unlocks enough volatility on the upside to reproduce the implied volatility smiles of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options. This PDV model, motivated by empirical studies, comes with computational challenges, especially in relation to VIX options pricing and calibration. We propose an accurate neural network approximation of the VIX which leverages on the Markovianity of the 4-factor version of the model. The VIX is learned as a function of the Markovian factors and the model parameters. We use this approximation to tackle the joint calibration of S&amp;P 500 and VIX options.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Broker Performance Evaluation through Intraday Modeling of Execution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimizing execution costs for large orders is a fundamental challenge in finance. Firms often depend on brokers to manage their trades due to limited internal resources for optimizing trading strategies. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of broker execution algorithms using trading data. We focus on two primary cost components: a linear cost that quantifies short-term execution quality and a quadratic cost associated with the price impact of trades. Using a model with transient price impact, we derive analytical formulas for estimating these costs. Furthermore, we enhance estimation accuracy by introducing novel methods such as weighting price changes based on their expected impact content. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimating both linear and impact costs, providing a robust and efficient framework for selecting the most cost-effective brokers.</description>
