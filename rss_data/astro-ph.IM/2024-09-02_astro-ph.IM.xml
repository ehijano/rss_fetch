      <title>A false positive transit candidate for EPIC 211101996 from K2 and TESS data identified as background eclipsing binary Gaia DR3 66767847894609792</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transiting planets around young stars are hard to find due to the enhanced stellar activity. Only a few transiting planets have been detected around stars younger than 100 Myr. We initially detected a transit-like signal in the K2 light curve of a very cool M dwarf star (EPIC 211101996) in the Pleiades open cluster, with an estimated age of about 100 Myr. Our detailed analysis of the per-pixel light curves, detrending with the W\={o}tan software and transit search with the Transit Least Squares algorithm showed that the source of the signal is a contaminant source (Gaia DR3 66767847894609792) 20" west of the target. The V-like shape of its phase-folded light curve and eclipse depth of ~15% suggest that it is a grazing eclipsing binary. The contaminant has hitherto been listed as a single star, which we now identify as an eclipsing stellar binary with a period of about 6 days.</description>

      <title>HighSpec: A High-Resolution Spectrograph for the MAST Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the updated design of HighSpec, a high-resolution $\mathcal{R} \sim 20,000$ spectrograph designed for the Multi Aperture Spectroscopic Telescope (MAST). HighSpec offers three observing modes centered at the Ca II H&amp;K, Mg b triplet, and H$\alpha$ lines. Each mode is supported by a highly optimized ion-etched grating, contributing to an exceptional instrument peak efficiency of $\gtrsim85\%$ for the two latter bands ($\gtrsim55\%$ for the Ca II H&amp;K band). Optimizing throughput over wavelength coverage ($\Delta \lambda=10-17$ nm), HighSpec enables the precise measurement of spectral lines from faint targets. This approach is especially relevant for stellar object studies, specifically of WDs, which are intrinsically faint and have few spectroscopic lines. Each observing mode was tailored to target spectral features essential for WD research. Its integration with MAST, an array of 20 custom-designed telescopes that can function as a single large telescope (equivalent to a $2.7$ m telescope in collecting area) or multiplexing over the entire sky, provides unique adaptability for extensive and effective spectroscopic campaigns. Currently in its final assembly and testing stages, HighSpec's on-sky commissioning is scheduled for 2025.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: MISTHIC simulation pipeline for the high contrast mode of MICADO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Python pipeline that was developed to simulate the high contrast mode images of the MICADO instrument. This mode will comprise three classical Lyot coronagraphs with different occulting spot sizes, one vector apodized phase plate, and two sparse aperture masks. One critical aspect of these modes lies in their sensitivity to aberrations, requiring careful integration of non common path aberrations, as well as turbulent adaptive optics (AO) residuals. Besides, they will be operated following a specific observing strategy based on pupil tracking mode. For these reasons, we have developed the MICADO SimulaTor for HIgh Contrast (MISTHIC) pipeline to simulate realistic image cubes and derive the expected performance of these modes. Several sources of aberrations can be included: turbulent AO residuals, but also static or rotating aberrations, amplitude aberrations, simple Zernike screens... Including MICADO's specific features, such as the absence of atmospheric dispersion prior to the coronagraphic focal plane mask, our intent is to make this pipeline available to the community. This tool can be used to prepare scientific observations with the high contrast mode of MICADO, by predicting the performance to be expected within the most realistic assumptions.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: Sparse Aperture Masks, design and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MICADO, the European Extremely Large Telescope first light imager will feature a dedicated high contrast imaging mode specifically designed for observing and characterizing exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Two sparse aperture masks (SAM) will be included, consisting of opaque masks with a set of holes arranged in a non-redundant configuration. Pupil masking transforms a monolithic telescope into an interferometer, with the aim of recovering spatial information down to the diffraction limit of the telescope and below, even in the presence of residual aberrations, such as turbulent AO residuals, and non common path aberrations. On the ELT, SAM will enable the detection of features down to 3.3mas in the J band, 12mas in the K band. Two designs have been chosen and will be reviewed, with complementarity in terms of sensitivity and spatial frequency coverage for image reconstruction. In this contribution, the technical choices will be detailed, such as the hole diameter and arrangement, given the technical constraints such as spectral filter bandwidths, detector dimensions, sampling, read-out-noise and frame rate. We will also report on simulations performed to assess the expected capabilities of this mode, with application examples of close companion detection and contrast curves.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Triggering: A Novel Event-Level Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale cosmic-ray detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) are pushing the boundaries of our ability to identify air shower events. Existing trigger schemes rely solely on the timing of signals detected by individual antennas, which brings many challenges in distinguishing true air shower signals from background. This work explores novel event-level radio trigger methods specifically designed for GRAND, but also applicable to other systems, such as the Radio Detector (RD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. In addition to an upgraded plane wave front reconstruction technique, we introduce orthogonal and complementary approaches that analyze the radio-emission footprint, the spatial distribution of signal strength across triggered antennas, to refine event selection. We test our methods on mock data sets constructed with simulated showers and real background noise measured with the GRAND prototype, to assess the performance potential in terms of sensitivity and background rejection in GRAND. Our preliminary results are a first step to identifying the most discriminating radio signal features at event-level, and optimizing the techniques for future implementation on experimental data.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Radio Emission of Inclined Air Showers in the 50-200 MHz Frequency Band for GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a distributed, sparse ground antenna array designed to detect the radio emission from highly inclined extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere. We use CoREAS air-shower simulations to adapt an existing signal model of the radio emission of inclined showers to the 50-200 MHz frequency band GRAND is sensitive to. The model uses a parameterisation of the charge excess emission to isolate the geomagnetic component. By fitting a one-dimensional lateral distribution function to the geomagnetic energy fluence of a shower, we reconstruct its radiation energy. This work details the signal model and the intrinsic event reconstruction of our method, as well as the adaptations to the new frequency band. This work is part of the NUTRIG project.</description>

      <title>An enhanced version of the Gaia map of the brightness of the natural sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GAia Map of the Brightness Of the Natural Sky (GAMBONS) is a model to map the natural night brightness of the sky in cloudless and moonless nights. It computes the star radiance from the photometric data in Gaia and Hipparcos catalogues, adding the contributions of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic light, zodiacal light and airglow, and taking into account the effects of atmospheric attenuation and scattering. The model allows computing the natural sky brightness in any given photometric band for a ground-based observer, if appropriate transformations from the Gaia bands are available. In this work we present the most recent improvements of the model, including the use of Gaia EDR3 data, the inclusion of a wide set of photometric bands and the derivation of additional sky brightness indicators, as the horizontal irradiance and the average hemispheric radiance</description>

      <title>Near-Real Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval from Precise Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology to generate low-latency, high spatio-temporal resolution thermospheric density estimates using publicly available Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft ephemerides. This provides a means of generating density estimates that can be used in a data-assimilative context by the satellite operations and thermosphere communities. It also contributes to the data base of high-resolution density estimates during geomagnetic storms -- which remains one of the major gaps for the development and benchmarking of density models. Using accelerometer-derived densities from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) spacecraft as truth, our method surpasses Energy Dissipation Rate-Type density retrieval techniques and three widely used operational density models in terms of accuracy: EDR (103.37%), JB2008 (85.43%), DTM2000 (52.73%), and NRLMSISE-00 (12.31%). We demonstrate the robustness of our methodology during a critical time for spacecraft operators -- attempting to operate in the presence of geomagnetic storms, by reconstructing density profiles along the orbits of three LEO satellites during 80 geomagnetic storms. These profiles exhibit high spatial and temporal resolution compared to three operational thermospheric models, highlighting the operational applicability and potential for their use in model validation. Our findings suggest that the increasing availability of precise orbit determination data offers a valuable, yet underutilized, resource that could provide a significant improvement to data assimilative thermospheric models, ultimately enhancing both spacecraft operations and thermospheric modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Maven: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Supernova Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common setting in astronomy is the availability of a small number of high-quality observations, and larger amounts of either lower-quality observations or synthetic data from simplified models. Time-domain astrophysics is a canonical example of this imbalance, with the number of supernovae observed photometrically outpacing the number observed spectroscopically by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time, no data-driven models exist to understand these photometric and spectroscopic observables in a common context. Contrastive learning objectives, which have grown in popularity for aligning distinct data modalities in a shared embedding space, provide a potential solution to extract information from these modalities. We present Maven, the first foundation model for supernova science. To construct Maven, we first pre-train our model to align photometry and spectroscopy from 0.5M synthetic supernovae using a constrastive objective. We then fine-tune the model on 4,702 observed supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Maven reaches state-of-the-art performance on both classification and redshift estimation, despite the embeddings not being explicitly optimized for these tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that pre-training with synthetic data improves overall performance. In the upcoming era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Maven serves as a Rosetta Stone for leveraging large, unlabeled and multimodal time-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>gaspery: Optimized Scheduling of Radial Velocity Follow-Up Observations for Active Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) follow-up is a critical complement of transiting exoplanet surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), both for validating discoveries of exoplanets and measuring their masses. Stellar activity introduces challenges to interpreting these measurements because the noise from the host star, which is often correlated in time, can result in high RV uncertainty. A robust understanding of stellar activity and how its timescales interact with the observing cadence can optimize limited RV resources. For this reason, in the era of over-subscribed, high-precision RV measurements, folding stellar activity timescales into the scheduling of observation campaigns is ideal. We present gaspery, an open-source code implementation to enable the optimization of RV observing strategies. Gaspery employs a generalized formulation of the Fisher Information for RV time series that also incorporates information about stellar correlated noise. We show that the information contained in an observing strategy can be significantly affected by beat frequencies between the orbital period of the planet, the stellar rotation period, and the observation epochs. We investigate how the follow-up observing strategy will affect the resulting radial velocity uncertainty, as a function of stellar properties such as the spot decay timescale and rotation period. We then describe two example use cases for gaspery: 1) calculating the minimum number of observations to reach an uncertainty tolerance in a correlated noise regime and 2) finding an optimal strategy given a fixed observing budget. Finally, we outline a prescription for selecting an observing strategy that is generalizable to different targets.</description>

      <title>Exploring mass measurements of supermassive black holes in AGN using GAMA photometry and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of massive photometric surveys, we explore several approaches to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) from optical ground-based imaging, in each case comparing to the independent SMBH mass measurement obtained from spectroscopic data. We select a case-study sample of 28 type 1 AGN hosted by nearby galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We perform multi-component spectral decomposition, extract the AGN component and calculate the SMBH mass from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line width and luminosity. The photometric $g$ and $i$ band data is decomposed into AGN+spheroid(+disc)(+bar) components with careful surface brightness fitting. From these, the SMBH mass is estimated using its relation with the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius (both used for the first time on ground-based optical imaging of AGN); and the more widely used scaling relations based on bulge or galaxy stellar mass. We find no correlation between the H$\alpha$-derived SMBH masses and those based on the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius, despite these being the most direct methods involving only one scaling relation. The bulge or galaxy stellar mass based methods both yield significant correlations, although with considerable scatter and, in the latter case, a systematic offset. We provide possible explanations for this and discuss the requirements, advantages and drawbacks of each method. These considerations will be useful to optimise stategies for upcoming high quality ground-based and space-borne sky surveys to estimate SMBH masses in large numbers of AGN.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Telluric Features and Stellar Variability with StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant barrier to achieving the radial velocity (RV) measurement accuracy and precision required to characterize terrestrial mass exoplanets is the existence of time-variable features in the measured spectra, from both telluric absorption and stellar variability, which affect measured line shapes and can cause apparent RV shifts. Reaching the desired accuracy using traditional techniques often requires avoiding lines contaminated by stellar variability and/or changing tellurics, and thus discarding a large fraction of the spectrum, lowering precision. New data-driven methods can help achieve extremely precise and accurate RVs by enabling the use of a larger fraction of the available data. While there exist methods for modeling telluric features or the stellar variability individually, there is a need for additional tools that are capable of modeling them simultaneously at the spectral level. Here we present StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for measuring Doppler shifts and creating data-driven models (with fast, physically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable spectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum, while accounting for the wavelength-dependent instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate SSOF's state-of-the-art performance on data from the NEID RV spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope for multiple stars. We show SSOF's, ability to accurately identify and characterize spectral variability and provide $\sim$2-6x smaller photon-limited errors over the NEID CCF-based pipeline and match the performance of SERVAL, a leading template-based pipeline, using only observed EPRV spectra.</description>

Abstract: Understanding space weather is vital for the protection of our terrestrial and space infrastructure. In order to predict space weather accurately, large amounts of data are required, particularly in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum. An exquisite source of information for such data is provided by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), which has been gathering solar measurements for the past 13 years. However, after a malfunction in 2014 affecting the onboard Multiple EUV Grating Spectrograph A (MEGS-A) instrument, the scientific output in terms of EUV measurements has been significantly degraded. Building upon existing research, we propose to utilize deep learning for the virtualization of the defective instrument. Our architecture features a linear component and a convolutional neural network (CNN) -- with EfficientNet as a backbone. The architecture utilizes as input grayscale images of the Sun at multiple frequencies -- provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) -- as well as solar magnetograms produced by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Our findings highlight how AIA data are all that is needed for accurate predictions of solar irradiance. Additionally, our model constitutes an improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art in the field, further promoting the idea of deep learning as a viable option for the virtualization of scientific instruments.</description>

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of autonomous radio-detection units to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to discover them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Presently, three prototype GRAND radio arrays are in operation: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nancay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the design of the radio-detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a look at the first data collected by GRANDProto13, the first phase of GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend establishing the Dedicated International Accelerator Laboratory for Space Travel related radiation research (DIAL-ST) to advance this field and evaluate protective biological pathways through particle accelerator experiments simulating cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>AI in Space for Scientific Missions: Strategies for Minimizing Neural-Network Model Upload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize space exploration by delegating several spacecraft decisions to an onboard AI instead of relying on ground control and predefined procedures. It is likely that there will be an AI/ML Processing Unit onboard the spacecraft running an inference engine. The neural-network will have pre-installed parameters that can be updated onboard by uploading, by telecommands, parameters obtained by training on the ground. However, satellite uplinks have limited bandwidth and transmissions can be costly. Furthermore, a mission operating with a suboptimal neural network will miss out on valuable scientific data. Smaller networks can thereby decrease the uplink cost, while increasing the value of the scientific data that is downloaded. In this work, we evaluate and discuss the use of reduced-precision and bare-minimum neural networks to reduce the time for upload. As an example of an AI use case, we focus on the NASA's Magnetosperic MultiScale (MMS) mission. We show how an AI onboard could be used in the Earth's magnetosphere to classify data to selectively downlink higher value data or to recognize a region-of-interest to trigger a burst-mode, collecting data at a high-rate. Using a simple filtering scheme and algorithm, we show how the start and end of a region-of-interest can be detected in on a stream of classifications. To provide the classifications, we use an established Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to an accuracy &gt;94%. We also show how the network can be reduced to a single linear layer and trained to the same accuracy as the established CNN. Thereby, reducing the overall size of the model by up to 98.9%. We further show how each network can be reduced by up to 75% of its original size, by using lower-precision formats to represent the network parameters, with a change in accuracy of less than 0.6 percentage points.</description>
