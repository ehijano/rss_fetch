      <title>Orbital Anatomy of Self-Interaction in Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interaction is a fundamental flaw of practical Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS DFT) approximations responsible for numerous qualitative and even catastrophic shortcomings. Whereas self-interaction is easy to characterize in one-electron systems, its orbital-dependent nature makes it difficult to uniquely define and decompose it and other components of the KS energy into orbital components. By starting from the orthogonal Hartree ansatz as the exchange-free self-interaction-free model, it is possible to uniquely define self-interaction and genuine exchange total energies as well as their decomposition into orbital contributions. Using Edmiston-Ruedenberg orbitals as a close numerical surrogate of the Hartree orbitals we investigate the accuracy of genuine exchange energies predicted by several levels of Jacob's ladder of functionals and their Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction corrected counterparts. Among several notable insights provided by the per-orbital breakdown of the KS energies the key is the delicate cancellation of errors between core and valence orbitals that belies the remarkable accuracy of many functionals (particularly, GGAs). Disruption of the cancellation by the PZ correction accounts for its relatively modest impact on GGAs and other semilocal functionals.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of Internal Coordinates Interpolation into the Freezing String Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved method for determining guess structures for transition state searches by incorporating internal coordinates interpolation into the freezing string method (FSM). We test our method on over 40 reactions across 3 benchmark datasets covering a diverse set of chemical reactions. Our results show that incorporation of internal coordinates interpolation improves the computational efficiency of the FSM by enabling the use of larger interpolation step sizes and fewer optimization steps per cycle while maintaining 100% success rate on benchmark chemical reaction test cases including systems where previous attempts based on linear synchronous transit interpolation have failed. We provide an open-source Python implementation of the FSM, in addition to the reactant, product, transition state structures of all reactions studied.</description>

      <title>Selected multi-criteria decision-making methods and their applications to product and system design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization has found numerous applications in engineering, particularly since 1960s. Many optimization applications in engineering have more than one objective (or performance criterion). Such applications require multi-objective (or multi-criteria) optimization (MOO or MCO). Spurred by this and development of techniques for handling multiple objectives, MOO has found many applications in engineering in the last two decades. Optimization of an application for more than one objective gives a set of optimal solutions (known as non-dominated or Pareto-optimal solutions), which are equally good in the sense that no objective can be further improved without resulting in deterioration of at least one other objective. MOO in engineering has mainly focused on development of a model for the application, formulation of the MOO problem and solution of the formulated problem to find Pareto-optimal solutions. However, for completion of MOO, one more step is required to choose one of these optimal solutions for implementation.</description>

      <title>ReactAIvate: A Deep Learning Approach to Predicting Reaction Mechanisms and Unmasking Reactivity Hotspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chemical reaction mechanism (CRM) is a sequence of molecular-level events involving bond-breaking/forming processes, generating transient intermediates along the reaction pathway as reactants transform into products. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial for designing and discovering new reactions. One of the currently available methods to probe CRMs is quantum mechanical (QM) computations. The resource-intensive nature of QM methods and the scarcity of mechanism-based datasets motivated us to develop reliable ML models for predicting mechanisms. In this study, we created a comprehensive dataset with seven distinct classes, each representing uniquely characterized elementary steps. Subsequently, we developed an interpretable attention-based GNN that achieved near-unity and 96% accuracy, respectively for reaction step classification and the prediction of reactive atoms in each such step, capturing interactions between the broader reaction context and local active regions. The near-perfect classification enables accurate prediction of both individual events and the entire CRM, mitigating potential drawbacks of Seq2Seq approaches, where a wrongly predicted character leads to incoherent CRM identification. In addition to interpretability, our model adeptly identifies key atom(s) even from out-of-distribution classes. This generalizabilty allows for the inclusion of new reaction types in a modular fashion, thus will be of value to experts for understanding the reactivity of new molecules.</description>

      <title>Atomic Decompositions of Periodic Electronic-Structure Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theory for partitioning simulations of periodic and solid-state systems into physically sound atomic contributions at the level of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Our theory is based on spatially localized linear combinations of crystalline Gaussian-type orbitals and, as such, capable of exposing local features within periodic electronic structures in a more intuitive and robust manner than alternatives based on the spatial distribution of atomic basis functions alone. Early decomposed cohesive energies of both molecular polymers and different crystalline polymorphs demonstrate how the atomic properties yielded by our theory convincingly align with the expected charge polarization in these systems, also whenever partial charges and Madelung energies may lend themselves somewhat ambiguous to interpretation.</description>

      <title>Two-electron two-nucleus effective Hamiltonian and the spin diffusion barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) involves a polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to hyperfine coupled nuclei and can increase the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by several orders of magnitude. The hyperfine coupling is considered to suppress nuclear dipolar flip-flop transitions, hindering the transport of nuclear hyperpolarization into the bulk (''spin-diffusion barrier''). Possible polarization-transfer pathways leading to DNP and subsequent spin diffusion between hypershifted nuclei in a two-electron two-nucleus four-spin system are investigated. The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applied to characterize transitions that are only possible as second-order effects. An energy-conserving electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop is identified, which combines an electron dipolar with a nuclear dipolar flip-flop process, describing spin diffusion close to electrons. The relevance of this process is supported by two-compartment model fits of HypRes-on experimental data. This suggests that all nuclear spins can contribute to the hyperpolarization of the bulk and the concept of a spin-diffusion barrier has to be reconsidered for samples with significant electron and nuclear dipolar couplings.</description>

      <title>Unified Implementation of Relativistic Wave Function Methods: 4C-iCIPT2 as a Showcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In parallel to the unified construction of relativistic Hamiltonians based solely on physical arguments [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 084111 (2024)], a unified implementation of relativistic wave function methods is achieved here via programming techniques (e.g., template metaprogramming and polymorphism in C++). That is, once the code for constructing the Hamiltonian matrix is made ready, all the rest can be generated automatically from existing templates used for the nonrelativistic counterparts. This is facilitated by breaking a second-quantized relativistic Hamiltonian down to diagrams that are topologically the same as those required for computing the basic coupling coefficients between spin-free configuration state functions (CSF). Moreover, both time reversal and binary double point group symmetries can readily be incorporated into molecular integrals and Hamiltonian matrix elements. The latter can first be evaluated in the space of (randomly selected) spin-dependent determinants and then transformed to that of spin-dependent CSFs, thanks to simple relations in between. As a showcase, we consider here the no-pair four-component relativistic iterative configuration interaction with selection and perturbation correction (4C-iCIPT2), which is a natural extension of the spin-free iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17, 949 (2021)], and can provide near-exact numerical results within the manifold of positive energy states (PES), as demonstrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach to Design Multi-Tubular Packed-Bed Membrane Reactor in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethylene is a crucial chemical in manufacturing numerous consumer products. In recent years, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) technique has garnered significant interest as a means for ethylene production due to its high ethylene selectivity and energy efficiency, the availability of ethane as a feedstock, and catalysts that can improve the performance of the process. This work delves into determining the optimal operating conditions for the ODHE process within a multi-tubular packed-bed membrane reactor by formulating and resolving multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems. The elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method is employed in conjunction with three different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods: (i) technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), (ii) preference ranking on the basis of ideal-average distance (PROBID), and (iii) simple additive weighting (SAW), to solve the MOO problems, obtain the optimal Pareto frontier, and recommend one solution for ultimate implementation. Through this approach, this work elucidates the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, deepens the comprehension of their interrelationships, and underscores the effects of decision variables on the optimization objectives. Consequently, this work provides practitioners with the insights needed for informed decision-making in the ODHE process operation.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Inner and Outer-Sphere Hot Electron Transfer in Au/p-GaN Photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring nonequilibrium hot carriers from plasmonic metal nanostructures is a dynamic field in optoelectronics, driving photochemical reactions such as solar fuel generation. The hot carrier injection mechanism and the reaction rate are highly impacted by the metal/molecule interaction. However, determining the primary type of the reaction and thus the injection mechanism of the hot carriers has remained elusive. In this work, we reveal an electron injection mechanism deviating from a purely outersphere process for the reduction of ferricyanide redox molecule in a gold/p-type gallium nitride (Au/p- GaN) photocathode system. Combining our experimental approach with ab initio simulations, we discover that the efficient inner-sphere transfer of low-energy electrons leads to a continuous enhancement in the photocathode device performance in the interband regime. These findings provide important mechanistic insights, showing our methodology as a powerful tool for analyzing and engineering hot-carrier-driven processes in plasmonic photocatalytic systems and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exciting DeePMD: Learning excited state energies, forces, and non-adiabatic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the DeePMD neural network architecture to predict electronic structure properties necessary to perform non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. While learning the excited state energies and forces follows a straightforward extension of the DeePMD approach for ground-state energies and forces, how to learn the map between the non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACV) and the local chemical environment descriptors of DeePMD is less trivial. Most implementations of machine-learning-based non-adiabatic dynamics inherently approximate the NACVs, with an underlying assumption that the energy-difference-scaled NACVs are conservative fields. We overcome this approximation, implementing the method recently introduced by Richardson [J. Chem. Phys. 158 011102 (2023)], which learns the symmetric dyad of the energy-difference-scaled NACV. The efficiency and accuracy of our neural network architecture is demonstrated through the example of the methaniminium cation CH$_2$NH$_2^+$.</description>

      <title>Introducing GPU-acceleration into the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of GPU4PySCF, a module that provides GPU acceleration of methods in PySCF. As a core functionality, this provides a GPU implementation of two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) for contracted basis sets comprising up to g functions using Rys quadrature. As an illustration of how this can accelerate a quantum chemistry workflow, we describe how to use the ERIs efficiently in the integral-direct Hartree-Fock Fock build and nuclear gradient construction. Benchmark calculations show a significant speedup of two orders of magnitude with respect to the multi-threaded CPU Hartree-Fock code of PySCF, and performance comparable to other GPU-accelerated quantum chemical packages including GAMESS and QUICK on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction and its various reduced ones as well as the relativistic corrections. Examples are such as the electron-phonon interaction, the Heisenberg exchange spin interaction, the superexchange interaction, the van der Waals interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, the Breit interaction, {\it etc}. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical or chemical properties of the matters or the biological activity of the living organisms on Earth at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Coulomb interaction relevant Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Simulation and Modeling of Complex Systems using Dynamical Graph Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dynamical Graph Grammar (DGG) formalism can describe complex system dynamics with graphs that are mapped into a master equation. An exact stochastic simulation algorithm may be used, but it is slow for large systems. To overcome this problem, an approximate spatial stochastic/deterministic simulation algorithm, which uses spatial decomposition of the system's time-evolution operator through an expanded cell complex (ECC), was previously developed and implemented for a cortical microtubule array (CMA) model. Here, computational efficiency is improved at the cost of introducing errors confined to interactions between adjacent subdomains of different dimensions, realized as some events occurring out of order. A rule instances to domains mapping function $\phi$, ensures the errors are local. This approach has been further refined and generalized in this work. Additional efficiency is achieved by maintaining an incrementally updated match data structure for all possible rule matches. The API has been redesigned to support DGG rules in general, rather than for one specific model. To demonstrate these improvements in the algorithm, we have developed the Dynamical Graph Grammar Modeling Library (DGGML) and a DGG model for the periclinal face of the plant cell CMA. This model explores the effects of face shape and boundary conditions on local and global alignment. For a rectangular face, different boundary conditions reorient the array between the long and short axes. The periclinal CMA DGG demonstrates the flexibility and utility of DGGML, and these new methods highlight DGGs' potential for testing, screening, or generating hypotheses to explain emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Pole Analysis of the Inter-Replica Correlation Function in a Two-Replica System as a Binary Mixture: Mean Overlap in the Cluster Glass Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the cluster glass phase of ultrasoft particles, we examine an annealed two-replica system endowed with an attractive inter-replica field similar to that of a binary symmetric electrolyte. Leveraging this analogy, we conduct pole analysis on the total correlation functions in the two-replica system where the inter-replica field will eventually be switched off. By synthesizing discussions grounded in the pole analysis with a hierarchical view of the free-energy landscape, we derive an analytical form of the mean overlap between two replicas within the mean field approximation of the Gaussian core model. This formula elucidates novel numerical findings observed in the cluster glass phase.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Matrix Product State Ansatz with Tests on Transcorrelated Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\rm H_2$, $\rm H_4$, and $\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory on Lane Formation in Electric-Field-Driven Ionic Mixtures: Flow-Kernel-Based Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated non-equilibrium ordering in driven colloidal suspensions: with increasing driving force, a uniform colloidal mixture transforms into a locally demixed state characterized by the lane formation or the emergence of strongly anisotropic stripe-like domains. Theoretically, we have found that a linear stability analysis of density dynamics can explain the non-equilibrium ordering by adding a non-trivial advection term. This advection arises from fluctuating flows due to non-Coulombic interactions associated with oppositely driven migrations. Recent studies based on the dynamical density functional theory (DFT) without multiplicative noise have introduced the flow kernel for providing a general description of the fluctuating velocity. Here, we assess and extend the above deterministic DFT by treating electric-field-driven binary ionic mixtures as the primitive model. First, we develop the stochastic DFT with multiplicative noise for the laning phenomena. The stochastic DFT considering the fluctuating flows allows us to determine correlation functions in a steady state. In particular, asymptotic analysis on the stationary charge-charge correlation function reveals that the above dispersion relation for linear stability analysis is equivalent to the pole equation for determining the oscillatory wavelength of charge--charge correlations. Next, the appearance of stripe-like domains is demonstrated not only by using the pole equation but also by performing the 2D inverse Fourier transform of the charge--charge correlation function without the premise of anisotropic homogeneity in the electric field direction.</description>

      <title>Flow Perturbation to Accelerate Unbiased Sampling of Boltzmann distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have been employed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution, but their application to high-dimensional systems is hindered by the significant computational cost of obtaining the Jacobian of the flow. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic Cartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is the largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative models.</description>

      <title>Long-Short-Range Message-Passing: A Physics-Informed Framework to Capture Non-Local Interaction for Scalable Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational simulation of chemical and biological systems using ab initio molecular dynamics has been a challenge over decades. Researchers have attempted to address the problem with machine learning and fragmentation-based methods. However, the two approaches fail to give a satisfactory description of long-range and many-body interactions, respectively. Inspired by fragmentation-based methods, we propose the Long-Short-Range Message-Passing (LSR-MP) framework as a generalization of the existing equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) with the intent to incorporate long-range interactions efficiently and effectively. We apply the LSR-MP framework to the recently proposed ViSNet and demonstrate the state-of-the-art results with up to 40% MAE reduction for molecules in MD22 and Chignolin datasets. Consistent improvements to various EGNNs will also be discussed to illustrate the general applicability and robustness of our LSR-MP framework. The code for our experiments and trained model weights could be found at https://github.com/liyy2/LSR-MP.</description>

Abstract: In this work we examine the nucleation from NaCl aqueous solutions within nano-confined environments, employing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations integrated with machine learning-derived reaction coordinates. Through our simulations, we successfully induce phase transitions between solid, liquid, and a hydrated phase, typically observed at lower temperatures in bulk environments. Interestingly, nano-confinement serves to stabilize the solid phase and elevate melting points. Our simulations explain these findings by underscoring the significant role of water, alongside ion aggregation and subtle, anistropic dielectric behavior, in driving nucleation within nano-constrained environments. This letter thus provides a framework for sampling, analyzing and understanding nucleation processes under nano-confinement.</description>

      <title>Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas from energy storage to solvents, where they have been touted as ``designer solvents'' as they can be mixed to precisely tailor the physiochemical properties. As using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to simulate ILs is still relatively unexplored, several questions need to be answered to see if MLIPs can be transformative for ILs. Since ILs are often not pure, but are either mixed together or contain additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be compositionally transferable, i.e., the MLIP can be applied to mixtures of ions not directly trained on, whilst only being trained on a few mixtures of the same ions. We also investigate the accuracy of MLIPs for a novel IL, which we experimentally synthesize and characterize. Our MLIP trained on $\sim$200 DFT frames is in reasonable agreement with our experiments and DFT.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Donnan equilibrium in charged slit-pores from a hybrid nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics / Monte Carlo method with ions and solvent exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion partitioning between different compartments (\emph{e.g.} a porous material and a bulk solution reservoir), known as Donnan equilibrium, plays a fundamental role in various contexts such as energy, environment, or water treatment. The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation, capturing the thermal motion of the ions with mean-field electrostatic interactions, is practically useful to understand and predict ion partitioning, despite its limited applicability to conditions of low salt concentrations and surface charge densities. Here, we investigate the Donnan equilibrium of coarse-grained dilute electrolytes confined in charged slit-pores in equilibrium with a reservoir of ions and solvent. We introduce and use an extension to confined systems of a recently developed hybrid nonequilibrium molecular dynamics / grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation method ("H4D"), which enhances the efficiency of solvent and ion-pair exchange via a fourth spatial dimension. We show that the validity range of linearized PB theory to predict the Donnan equilibrium of dilute electrolytes can be extended to highly charged pores, by simply considering \textit{renormalized} surface charge densities. We compare with simulations of implicit solvent models of electrolytes and show that in the low salt concentrations and thin electric double layer limit considered here, an explicit solvent has a limited effect on the Donnan equilibrium and that the main limitations of the analytical predictions are not due to the breakdown of the mean-field description, but rather to the charge renormalization approximation, because it only focuses on the behavior far from the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamic bounds on logical circuit operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Binless Multidimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Binless Multidimensional Thermodynamic Integration (BMTI) method for nonparametric, robust, and data-efficient density estimation. BMTI estimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density differences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences are integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a maximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a multidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique developed in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis, estimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an explicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning, but rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly associated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively reconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The method is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets, where it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on realistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.</description>
