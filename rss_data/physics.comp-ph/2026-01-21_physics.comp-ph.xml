      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.</description>

      <title>Level set-based topology optimization of micropolar solids under thermo-mechanical loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel level set-based topology optimization for micropolar solids subjected to thermo-mechanical loading. To capture the size effects, we have incorporated the microstructural length-scale information into the level set-based topology optimization method by adopting a micropolar theory. The proposed non-local topology optimization method can provide accurate topology optimization for size-dependent solids under thermo-mechanical loading. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a few representative two-dimensional benchmark problems. The numerical results reveal the substantial influence of underlying micro-structures, incorporated in the model through micropolar parameters, and temperature on topology optimization, highlighting the necessity of the proposed thermo-mechanical micropolar formulation for materials with pronounced non-local effects. For the numerical implementation of the proposed model, we have used open-source finite element libraries, \texttt{Gridap.jl}, and \texttt{GridapTopOpt.jl}, available in Julia, to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the reported computational results.</description>

      <title>Pad\'e Approximation and Partition Function Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fisher zeros play a central role in the theoretical understanding of phase transitions. However, their computation requires knowledge of the density of states, which limits their practical applicability. Alternative approaches based on the Energy Probability Distribution (EPD) and Moment Generating Function (MGF) alleviate the computational cost but suffer from convergence issues in the two-dimensional \textbf{anisotropic Heisenberg} model (XY model). In this work, we introduce a Pad\'e approximation to systematically reduces the number of zeros required in the Fisher, EPD, and MGF formulations without loss of accuracy. Moreover, since the Fisher zeros formulation does not rely on a convergence algorithm, their combination with a Pad\'e approximation enables a reliable analysis of the XY model while significantly reducing computational cost. Applications to the two-dimensional Ising and XY models demonstrate substantial reductions in polynomial degree and computation time while preserving accurate estimates of the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Efficient O(N^1.5) Electronic Structure Computation of Million-Atom Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of quantum phenomena in complex materials such as moir\'e superlattices is limited by the O(N^3) scaling of conventional electronic structure methods. Here we introduce a high-performance tight-binding framework that reduces the complexity to O(N^1.5) by transforming the Hamiltonian into a real symmetric form and combining Sylvester's inertia law with LDL decomposition. This approach enables efficient band structure calculations for large systems: solving magic angle twisted bilayer graphene in minutes on a laptop and scaling to 1.5 million atoms within days on a workstation. We apply it to the previously inaccessible ultra-low twist-angle regime (less than 0.16 degree) with mechanical strain relaxation and find robust flat bands persisting down to 0.09 degree. Our framework bridges density functional theory accuracy with large-scale quantum simulation, opening a route to systematic data-driven exploration of mesoscale quantum materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent letter [T. D. K\"uhne, M. Krack, F. Mohamed and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 066401 (2007)], we outlined a new Car-Parrinello-like approach to Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. Here, we provide a guide to performing actual calculations using our method and demonstrate this on liquid water at ambient conditions. We do not go into methodological details beyond those necessary for applying this approach, but focus on practical details pertinent to our particular implementation within the CP2K/Quickstep code [T. D. K\"uhne et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)].</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Bifurcation Analysis of the Hindmarsh-Rose Neuron Model with Blue-Sky Catastrophe under Magnetic Field Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic-field-induced feedback on the dynamics of a Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model exhibiting a blue-sky catastrophe. By introducing a magnetic flux variable that couples nonlinearly to the membrane potential, we demonstrate that electromagnetic effects profoundly reshape neuronal firing patterns and bifurcation structure. Interspike-interval bifurcation analysis reveals a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic coupling strength, with weak coupling preserving regular spiking and bursting, intermediate coupling promoting chaotic bursting, and strong coupling yielding structured irregular dynamics. These transitions are quantitatively characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent computed via the Wolf algorithm and supported by Poincar\'e sections and time-series analysis. Our results establish electromagnetic feedback as a robust and tunable mechanism for controlling instability and chaos in slow-fast neuronal systems.</description>

      <title>Refined Gradient-Based Temperature Optimization for the Replica-Exchange Monte-Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The replica-exchange Monte-Carlo (RXMC) method is a powerful Markov-chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling from multi-modal distributions, which are challenging for conventional methods. The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space. Furthermore, our proposed method offers a significant advantage over recently proposed policy gradient method that require careful hyperparameter tuning, while simultaneously preventing the constraint violations that destabilize optimization.</description>

      <title>Efficient local classification of parity-based material topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>An efficient treatment of heat-flux boundary conditions in GSIS for rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat-flux boundary conditions are challenging to implement efficiently in rarefied gas flow simulations because the wall-reflected gas temperature and density must be determined dynamically during the computation. This paper aims to tackle this problem within the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved deterministically in an outer loop and macroscopic synthetic equations are solved in an inner loop. To avoid kinetic-macroscopic boundary-flux mismatch and the resulting convergence bottlenecks, for the macroscopic boundary flux at every inner iteration, the incident increment is estimated using a Maxwellian distribution, and then the reflected contribution is obtained by boundary conditions consistent with those in the kinetic solver. In addition to retaining the fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, the proposed method significantly reduces the iterations required to determine the wall-reflected gas parameters. Numerical simulations of rarefied gas flows in and around a 3D nozzle, a 2D adiabatic cylinder, and a 2D annular heat-transfer configuration show good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, while achieving substantial efficiency gains over conventional iterative schemes.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based optimization of exact stochastic kinetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al. PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $\alpha&lt;1$ R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled two-phase flow and surfactant/PFAS transport in porous media with angular pores: From pore-scale physics to Darcy-scale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media are central to many natural and engineering applications. Surfactants alter two-phase flow by modifying interfacial tension and wettability, while two-phase flow controls surfactant transport pathways and interfacial adsorption. These coupled processes are commonly modeled using Darcy-type two-phase flow equations combined with advection--dispersion--adsorption transport equations, with capillary pressure--saturation relationships scaled by the Leverett $J$-function. However, the Leverett $J$-function idealizes porous media as bundles of cylindrical tubes and decouples interfacial tension and wettability, limiting its ability to represent angular pore geometries and interfacial tension--wettability coupling effects. We present a modeling framework that explicitly incorporates pore angularity and interfacial tension--wettability coupling into Darcy-scale surfactant-laden flow and transport models. Two-phase flow properties are derived for angular pores, upscaled across pore size distributions, and formulated as explicit and closed-form expressions. These upscaled relationships are integrated into a coupled flow--transport model to simulate transient two-phase flow and surfactant transport. Results reveal a nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependence of two-phase flow properties on pore angularity, pore size distribution, and interfacial tension. Example simulations of water flow and PFAS migration in unsaturated soils indicate that surfactant-induced flow effects on PFAS leaching are generally minor under typical conditions, whereas pore angularity strongly controls water flow, interfacial area, and PFAS retention. Overall, the proposed framework provides a more physically grounded approach for modeling two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP-PAW is a combined electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics code to perform mixed quantum and classical simulations of atomistic condensed phase systems, such as solids, liquids, and molecular systems. As the name suggests, the CP-PAW code unifies the all-electron projector augmented-wave method with the Car-Parrinello approach to determine not only the electronic and nuclear ground state of condensed matter, but also to study their properties and dynamics. In addition to briefly outlining the underlying theory, the focus will be on unique aspects of CP-PAW and how to correctly employ them as a user. How to install CP-PAW using the new build system will also be briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Implicit Finite Difference Solvers Implemented in JAX for Shock Wave Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock dynamics and nonlinear wave propagation are fundamental to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and high-speed flow modeling. In this study, we developed explicit and implicit finite-difference solvers for the one-dimensional Burgers viscous equation to model shock formation, propagation, and dissipation. The governing equation, which incorporates convective and diffusive effects, serves as a simplified analogue of the Navier-Stokes equations. Using the Finite-JAX framework, each solver is implemented with upwind and central finite-difference schemes for the convective and diffusive terms, respectively. Time integration is performed using explicit forward Euler and implicit backward-time central space (BTCS) schemes under periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Stability is ensured by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) criteria for the convective and diffusive components. Numerical experiments quantify the accuracy, convergence, and real-time performance of JAX across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, demonstrating that JAX maintains fidelity while achieving portability. The results show that the explicit scheme captures impact accurately under strict time-step constraints, while the implicit formulation provides greater stability and accuracy at a higher computational cost. Taken together, these results establish a reproducible dataset for benchmarking CFD solvers and training machine learning models for nonlinear transport and impact-driven phenomena. Our new implementation of FiniteJAX enhances the portability, scalability, and performance of solvers based on the JAX framework developed by Google DeepMind.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $^7$Be Weak and Radiative Transition Rates in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Implications for the Primordial Lithium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li.</description>

      <title>Unified multifractal description of longitudinal and transverse intermittency in fully developed turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale intermittency is a defining feature of fully developed fluid turbulence, marked by rare and extreme fluctuations of velocity increments and gradients that defy mean-field descriptions. Existing multifractal descriptions of intermittency focus primarily on longitudinal increments and gradients, despite mounting evidence that transverse components exhibit distinct and stronger intermittency. Here, we develop a unified multifractal framework that jointly prescribes longitudinal and transverse velocity increments, and extends to gradients. We derive explicit relations linking inertial-range scaling exponents of structure functions to moments of velocity gradients in dissipation range. Our results reveal that longitudinal gradient scaling is solely prescribed by longitudinal structure functions, as traditionally expected; however, transverse gradient scaling is prescribed by mixed longitudinal-transverse structure functions. Validation with high-resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence, at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to $1300$ demonstrates excellent agreement, paving way for a more complete and predictive description of intermittency faithful to the underlying turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Reorienting off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB) via Minimum Mode Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel spatial discretization technique for the reliable and efficient simulation of magnetization dynamics governed by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation. The overall discretization error is systematically decomposed into temporal and spatial components. The spatial error analysis is conducted by formulating the LL equation within the framework of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) method.

      <title>Multiscale Prediction of Polymer Relaxation Dynamics via Computational and Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</description>

      <title>Learning time-dependent and integro-differential collision operators from plasma phase space data using differentiable simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional and stochastic wave-particle dynamics in plasmas far from equilibrium are complex, temporally evolving, stochastic processes which are challenging to model. In this work, we extend previous methods coupling differentiable kinetic simulators and plasma phase space diagnostics to learn collision operators that account for time-varying background distributions. We also introduce a more general integro-differentiable operator formulation to probe relevant terms in the collision operator. To validate the proposed methodology we use data generated by self-consistent electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations. We show that both approaches recover operators that can accurately reproduce the plasma phase space dynamics while being more accurate than estimates based on particle track statistics. These results further demonstrate the potential of using differentiable simulators to infer collision operators for scenarios where no closed form solution exists or deviations from existing theory are expected.</description>

      <title>BladeSDF : Unconditional and Conditional Generative Modeling of Representative Blade Geometries Using Signed Distance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has emerged as a transformative paradigm in engineering design, enabling automated synthesis and reconstruction of complex 3D geometries while preserving feasibility and performance relevance. This paper introduces a domain-specific implicit generative framework for turbine blade geometry using DeepSDF, addressing critical gaps in performance-aware modeling and manufacturable design generation. The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs. By integrating constraints, objectives, and performance metrics, this approach advances beyond traditional 2D-guided or unconstrained 3D pipelines, offering a practical and interpretable solution for data-driven turbine blade modeling and concept generation.</description>

      <title>Improving the local solution of the DG predictor of the ADER-DG method for solving systems of ordinary differential equations and its applicability to systems of differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved local numerical solution for the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor for solving the initial value problem for a first-order ODE system is proposed. The improved local numerical solution demonstrates convergence orders of one higher than the convergence order of the local numerical solution of the original ADER-DG numerical method and has the property of continuity at grid nodes. Rigorous proofs of the approximation orders of the local numerical solution and the improved local numerical solution are presented. Obtaining the proposed improved local numerical solution does not require significant changes to the structure of the ADER-DG numerical method. Therefore, all conclusions regarding the convergence orders of the numerical solution at grid nodes, the resulting superconvergence, and the high stability of the ADER-DG numerical method remain unchanged. A wide range of applications of the ADER-DG numerical method is presented for solving specific initial value problems for ODE systems for a wide range of polynomial degrees. The obtained results provide strong confirmation for the developed rigorous theory. The improved local numerical solution is shown to exhibit both higher accuracy and improved smoothness and point-wise comparability. Empirical convergence orders of all individual numerical solutions were calculated for a wide range of error norms, which well agree with the expected convergence orders. The rigorous proof, based on the $\epsilon$-embedding method, of the applicability of the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor to solving DAE systems is presents.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate two characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is the one best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a finite element method (FEM) framework enhanced by an operator-adapted wavelet decomposition algorithm designed for the efficient analysis of multiscale electromagnetic problems. Usual adaptive FEM approaches, while capable of achieving the desired accuracy without requiring a complete re-meshing of the computational domain, inherently couple different resolution levels. This coupling requires recomputation of coarser-level solutions whenever finer details are added to improve accuracy, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Our proposed method addresses this issue by decoupling resolution levels. This feature enables independent computations at each scale that can be incorporated into the solutions to improve accuracy whenever needed, without requiring re-computation of coarser-level solutions. The main algorithm is hierarchical, constructing solutions from finest to coarser levels through a series of sparse matrix-vector multiplications. Due to its sparse nature, the overall computational complexity of the algorithm is nearly linear. Moreover, Krylov subspace iterative solvers are employed to solve the final linear equations, with ILU preconditioners that enhance solver convergence and maintain overall computational efficiency. The numerical experiments presented in this article verify the high precision and nearly linear computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Memorization in Autoregressive Deep Learning: Or, Examining Temporal Decay of Gradient Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights regarding the design of improved surrogates.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product-state-based band-Lanczos solver for quantum cluster approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present matrix-product state (MPS) based band Lanczos method as solver for quantum cluster methods such as the variational cluster approximation. While a na\"ive implementation of MPS as cluster solver would barely improve its range of applicability, we show that our approach makes it possible to treat cluster geometries well beyond the reach of exact diagonalization methods. The key modifications we introduce are a continuous energy truncation combined with a convergence criterion that is more robust against approximation errors introduced by the MPS representation and provides a bound to deviations in the resulting Green's function. The potential of the resulting cluster solver is demonstrated by computing the self-energy functional for the single-band Hubbard model at half filling in the strongly correlated regime, on different cluster geometries. Here, we find that only when treating large cluster sizes, observables can be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, which we demonstrate at the example of the staggered magnetization. Treating clusters sizes with up to $6\times 6$ sites we obtain significant improvement over the extrapolation accessible with exact diagonalization solvers when comparing to quantum Monte Carlo results. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the MPS cluster solver to more complex models by calculating spectral properties as relevant for the electron-doped cuprate CaCuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>High-precision and low-depth quantum algorithm design for eigenstate problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g. time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians' eigenstate properties is $\tilde{O} (\log \varepsilon^{-1})$, which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision $\varepsilon$. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count (CNOT and non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2,000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates, and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale quantum many-body systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding strongly correlated physics. However, two fundamental problems, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Recurrent convolutional neural networks for modeling non-adiabatic dynamics of quantum-classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolution neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolution (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. We apply our RNN approach to learn the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model after an interaction quench. For shallow quenches (small changes in electron-lattice coupling), the deterministic dynamics can be accurately captured using a single-CNN-based recurrent network. In contrast, deep quenches induce chaotic evolution, making long-term trajectory prediction significantly more challenging. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the PARC-CNN architecture can effectively learn the statistical climate of the Holstein model under deep-quench conditions.</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train/matrix product state (MPS) representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the MPS representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing MPS in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical and computational framework to model the dynamics of open lipid bilayer membranes interacting with ambient Stokes flow. The model explicitly couples the three-dimensional viscous fluid, the two-dimensional membrane surface, and its one-dimensional free edge. We develop an axisymmetric hybrid BEM-FEM method that solves the problem with an effective one-dimensional formulation. A key component is a local mesh refinement strategy designed to accurately resolve singularities and boundary layers originating at the membrane edge. Several numerical examples are provided to showcase its ability to capture intricate edge dynamics and multiscale fluid-membrane coupling.</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which require a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is unclear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, as measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no comprehensive analysis of how the TT representation affects the turbulent properties has yet been carried out. We fill this gap by analyzing TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and generate 3D snapshots with turbulent-like features. Specifically, we first investigate the effect of TT compression on key turbulence signatures, such as the energy spectrum, the PDF of velocity increments, and flatness. Second, we extend the 2D TT-solver introduced in [1] to a 3D cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. We use it to simulate the incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics at $Re_{\lambda}=315$ for a total of 9-10 Kolmogorov turnover times, showcasing the numerical stability of the TT-solver in fully developed turbulent regimes. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to synthesize artificial snapshots that exhibit turbulent-like features, with a logarithmic cost in the mesh size. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of the TT representation to capture the characteristic features of turbulence. This offers a powerful quantum-inspired toolkit for the computational treatment of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations of a thermal Couette flow and a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review and study the correspondence between discrete lattice/chain models of interacting particles and their continuous counterparts represented by partial differential equations. We study the correspondence problem for nearest neighbour interaction lattice models as well as for multiple-neighbour interaction lattice models, and we gradually proceed from infinite lattices to periodic lattices and finally to finite lattices with fixed ends/zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.</description>
