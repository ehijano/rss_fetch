      <title>The center-symmetric Landau gauge meets the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lattice implementation of the recently introduced center-symmetric Landau gauge is discussed and its predictions confronted with numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the link average and the link correlators computed in that gauge are order parameters of the confinement-deconfinement transition at nonzero temperature. Strictly speaking, this requires a specific treatment of the Gribov copies that we discuss in detail. The numerical simulations comply with the theoretical predictions for the link average computed below and above the deconfinement temperature. Our results show that, within appropriately chosen gauges, one can construct local order parameters for center symmetry, as proxies for the non-local Polyakov loop.</description>

      <title>Axion QED as a Lattice Gauge Theory and Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-invertible symmetry associated with chiral symmetry in axion quantum electrodynamics (QED) using the modified Villain formulation. In axion QED, it is known that naive magnetic objects such as 't Hooft loops and axion strings lose their gauge invariance due to the violation of the Bianchi identity for the field strength of the photon or "field strength" of the axion. First, we construct the action of axion QED on the square lattice, which is more intricate than its counterpart in the continuum theory. We then observe the breaking of gauge invariance. Subsequently, we construct gauge-invariant magnetic objects by introducing new degrees of freedom localized at the positions of the magnetic objects. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the response of the magnetic objects under the action of the non-invertible symmetry operator constructed in Ref. [1]. In this analysis, we employ a method different from the so-called half-space gauging, which is the standard method to study non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, illustrating their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of pseudo-scalar mesons through the QCD chiral crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarise recent progress towards the non-perturbative determination of thermal spectral functions for pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD by exploiting constraints imposed by micro-causality at finite temperature. For temperatures not much above the vacuum particle mass, continuous contributions from scattering, Landau damping and collective excitations are found to be negligible. This allows for a quantitative description of spatial and temporal lattice correlators in terms of thermoparticles, i.e.~vacuum excitations modified by medium effects, with resonance-like structures persisting for a range above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light-flavor diquarks in the inverse matrix method of QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reexamines the spectroscopic parameters of light-flavor diquarks within the framework of quantum chromodynamics sum rules (QCDSR) using the inverse matrix method. Conventional QCDSR analyses are based on assumptions such as quark-hadron duality and continuum models, which introduce a degree of systematic uncertainty. The inverse matrix method circumvents these assumptions by reformulating the problem as an inverse integral equation and expanding the unknown spectral density using orthogonal Laguerre polynomials. This method allows for a direct determination of spectral densities, thereby enhancing the precision of predictions regarding resonance masses and decay constants. By employing this methodology with regard to light-flavor diquarks ($sq$ and $ud$), it is possible to extract the associated masses and decay constants. The results indicate that the masses of diquarks with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 0^-$ are nearly degenerate. We compare our results regarding masses and decay constants with those of other theoretical predictions, which could prove a useful complementary tool in interpretation. Our results are consistent with those in the literature and can be shown as evidence for the consistency of the method. The results achieved in this study highlight the potential of the inverse matrix method as a robust tool for exploring nonperturbative QCD phenomena and elucidating the internal structure of exotic hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be faster than linear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-charmonium interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a realistic lattice QCD study on low-energy $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions based on (2+1) flavor configurations with nearly physical pion mass $m_\pi=146$ MeV. The interactions, extracted from the spacetime correlations of nucleon and charmonium system by using the HAL QCD method, are found to be attractive in all distances and possess a characteristic long-range tail consistent with the two-pion exchange potential. The resulting $S$-wave scattering lengths are $0.30(2)\left(^{+0}_{-2}\right)$ fm, $0.38(4)\left(^{+0}_{-3}\right)$ fm, and $0.21(2)\left(^{+0}_{-1}\right)$ fm for spin-$3/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N$-$J/\psi$, and spin-$1/2$ $N$-$\eta_c$, respectively. Our results are orders of magnitude larger than those from the photoproduction experiments assuming the vector meson dominance. Our findings may provide deeper understanding of the nonperturbative QCD phenomena ranging from the origin of nucleon mass to the in-medium $J/\psi$ mass modification as well as the properties of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Toward inclusive observables with staggered quarks: the smeared $R$~ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusive hadronic observables are ubiquitous in particle and nuclear physics. Computation of these observables using lattice QCD is challenging due the presence of a difficult inverse problem. As a stepping stone to more complicated observables, we report on progress to compute the smeared $R$~ratio with staggered quarks using the spectral reconstruction algorithm of Hansen, Lupo, and Tantalo. We compare staggered-quark results on two ensembles to domain-wall results on a single ensemble and to the Bernecker-Meyer parameterization. This work utilizes two ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration using highly improved staggered quarks and one ensemble generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration using domain-wall quarks. Possible strategies for controlling opposite-parity effects associated with staggered quarks are discussed.</description>

      <title>Winding number on 3D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple numerical method which computes an approximate value of the winding number of a mapping from 3D torus~$T^3$ to the unitary group~$U(N)$, when $T^3$ is approximated by discrete lattice points. Our method consists of a ``tree-level improved'' discretization of the winding number and the gradient flow associated with an ``over-improved'' lattice action. By employing a one-parameter family of mappings from $T^3$ to $SU(2)$ with known winding numbers, we demonstrate that the method works quite well even for coarse lattices, reproducing integer winding numbers in a good accuracy. Our method can trivially be generalized to the case of higher-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV, with the errors being only statistical. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>
