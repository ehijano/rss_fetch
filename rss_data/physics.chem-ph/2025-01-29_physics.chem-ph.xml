      <title>Symmetry- and Gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process Regression for the Active Learning of Potential Energy Surfaces in Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical investigation of gas adsorption, storage, separation, diffusion and related transport processes in porous materials relies on a detailed knowledge of the potential energy surface of molecules in a stationary environment. In this article, a new algorithm is presented, specifically developed for gas transport phenomena, which allows for a highly cost-effective determination of molecular potential energy surfaces. It is based on a symmetry-enhanced version of Gaussian Process Regression with embedded gradient information and employs an active learning strategy to keep the number of single point evaluations as low as possible. The performance of the algorithm is tested for a selection of gas sieving scenarios on porous, N-functionalized graphene and for the intermolecular interaction of CH$_4$ and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>Excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics in explicit solvent using machine learned interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state nonadiabatic simulations with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) are essential to understand photoinduced processes in explicit environments. However, the high computational cost of the underlying quantum chemical calculations limits its application in combination with trajectory surface hopping methods. Here, we use FieldSchNet, a machine-learned interatomic potential capable of incorporating electric field effects into the electronic states, to replace traditional QM/MM electrostatic embedding with its ML/MM counterpart for nonadiabatic excited state trajectories. The developed method is applied to furan in water, including five coupled singlet states. Our results demonstrate that with sufficiently curated training data, the ML/MM model reproduces the electronic kinetics and structural rearrangements of QM/MM surface hopping reference simulations. Furthermore, we identify performance metrics that provide robust and interpretable validation of model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Excited State Absorption: Reference Oscillator Strengths, Wavefunction and TD-DFT Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state absorption (ESA) corresponds to the transition between two electronic excited states and is a fundamental process for probing and understanding light-matter interactions. Accurate modeling of ESA is indeed often required to interpret time-resolved experiments. In this contribution, we present a dataset of 53 ESA oscillator strengths in three different gauges and the associated vertical transition energies between 71 excited states of 23 small- and medium-sized molecules from the QUEST database. The reference values were obtained within the quadratic-response (QR) CC3 formalism using eight different Dunning basis sets. We found that the d-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is always adequate while its more compact double-$\zeta$ counterpart, d-aug-cc-pVDZ, performs well in most applications. These QR-CC3 data allow us to assess the performance of QR-TDDFT, with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, using a panel of global and range-separated hybrids (B3LYP, BH{\&amp;}HLYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP33, and LC-BLYP47), as well as several lower-order wavefunction methods, i.e., QR-CCSD, QR-CC2, EOM-CCSD, ISR-ADC(2), and ISR-ADC(3). We show that QR-TDDFT delivers acceptable errors for ESA oscillator strengths, with CAM-B3LYP showing particular promise, especially for the largest molecules of our set. We also find that ISR-ADC(3) exhibits excellent performance</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Temperature and Density Discontinuities for Phase-Change Heat Transfer With Non-condensable Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent prior work, the author derived interfacial mass and heat flux conditions for phase-change processes. The mass flux condition is identical to the Schrage equation, but the additional heat flux expression enables one to couple the interface to the continua in both the liquid and the vapor phases and compute the interfacial temperature and density discontinuities. However, questions exist on how to treat phase change heat transfer in the presence of non-condensable gases. In this work, the author shows that the same set of interfacial conditions can be used to account for the presence of non-condensable gases. Although the mass flux of non-condensable gas is zero, their presence impacts the heat transfer. For evaporation, when the presence of the non-condensable gas is small, temperature and density discontinuities persist across the interface, as well as inverted temperature distributions. For condensation, however, no temperature inversion happens in the presence of a small amount of non-condensable gas and the interfacial temperature jump is significantly smaller. When a large amount of non-condensable gas is present, such as for evaporation into and condensation from air, the temperature discontinuities at the interface are significantly smaller and no temperature inversion happens. For evaporation driven purely by humidity difference, temperature inversion and discontinuity still exist. Results from this work will benefit the modeling of phase change processes in the presence of non-condensable gases, evaporative cooling in air, air-gap distillation, atmospheric water harvesting, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <title>Combining Hammett $\sigma$ constants for $\Delta$-machine learning and catalyst discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz to model relative substrate binding within homogenous organometallic catalysis, assigning $\sigma$ and $\rho$ to ligands and metals, respectively. Implementing an additive combination (c) rule for obtaining $\sigma$ constants for any ligand pair combination results in a cHIP model that enhances data efficiency in computational ligand tuning. We show its usefulness (i) as a baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning (ML), and (ii) to identify novel catalyst candidates via volcano plots. After testing the combination rule on Hammett constants previously published in the literature, we have generated numerical evidence for the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) C-C cross-coupling reaction using two synthetic datasets of metallic catalysts (including (10) and (11)-metals Ni, Pd, Pt, and Cu, Ag, Au as well as 96 ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes, phosphines, or pyridines). When used as a baseline, $\Delta$-ML prediction errors of relative binding decrease systematically with training set size and reach chemical accuracy ($\sim$1 kcal/mol) for 20k training instances. Employing the individual ligand constants obtained from cHIP, we report relative substrate binding for a novel dataset consisting of 720 catalysts (not part of training data), of which 145 fall into the most promising range on the volcano plot accounting for oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination steps. Multiple Ni-based catalysts, e.g. Aphos-Ni-P($t$-Bu)$_3$, are included among these promising candidates, potentially offering dramatic cost savings in experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dance of Molecules: Ro-Vibrational Dynamics of Molecules under Intense Illumination at Complex Plasmonic Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum dynamics of strongly coupled molecule-cavity systems remains a significant challenge in molecular polaritonics. This work develops a comprehensive self-consistent model simulating electromagnetic interactions of diatomic molecules with quantum ro-vibrational degrees of freedom in resonant optical cavities. The approach employs an efficient numerical methodology to solve coupled Schrodinger-Maxwell equations in real space-time, enabling three-dimensional simulations through a novel molecular mapping technique. The study investigates relaxation dynamics of an ensemble of molecules following intense resonant pump excitation in Fabry-Perot cavities and at three-dimensional plasmonic metasurfaces. The simulations reveal dramatically modified relaxation pathways inside cavities compared to free space, characterized by persistent molecular alignment arising from cavity-induced rotational pumping. They also indicate the presence of a previously unreported relaxation stabilization mechanism driven by dephasing of the collective molecular-cavity mode. Additionally, the study demonstrates that strong molecular coupling significantly modifies the circular dichroism spectra of chiral metasurfaces, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. This approach, which is mathematically equivalent to finding the first moment of the Fourier series of the mass density, suffers from some numerical error. Here, we discuss this inaccuracy and propose an extension that overcomes it, enabling improved accuracy across computational simulation.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 6,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the failure of equipartition for the p-V behavior of liquid water and the hydration free energy components of a small protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model of water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fs to ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we extend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous protein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein BBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration time-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus barostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensure consistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning alleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step used with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations, and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also seen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the $NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution to the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These contributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fs to $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals contribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free energy reported for this protein.</description>
