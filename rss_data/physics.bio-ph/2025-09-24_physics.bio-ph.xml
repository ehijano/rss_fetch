      <title>Evolution of phenocopying in a dynamical model of developmental trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary emergent metabolic interactions in cell cultures: A Statistical Mechanics point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell cultures exhibit rich and complex behaviors driven by dynamic metabolic interactions among cells. In this work, we present a model that captures these interactions through a framework inspired by statistical mechanics. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a population of cells arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, where each cell is characterized by fluxes of three reactions: glucose consumption ($g$), respiration ($r$), and waste production/absorption ($w$). The system minimizes an energy function influenced by competitive ($J_g &gt; 0$) and cooperative ($J_w &lt; 0$) couplings between cells. Our results reveal three distinct phases: a competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics, we demonstrate how initially non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to heterogeneous cultures sustained by cross-feeding. These findings are further supported by analytical solutions derived using mean-field approximations. The model provides insights into how environmental constraints and stochastic fluctuations shape community structures, offering a versatile approach to study several emergent phenomena in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamicasome: a molecular dynamics-guided and AI-driven pathogenicity prediction catalogue for all genetic mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.</description>

      <title>Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Microcanonical Histogram Analysis and Application to Peptide Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach designed to directly estimate microcanonical quantities from energy histograms is proposed, which enables the immediate systematic identification and classification of phase transitions in physical systems of any size by means of the recently introduced generalized microcanonical inflection-point analysis method. The application to the aggregation problem of GNNQQNY heptapeptides, for which the entire transition sequence is revealed, shows the power of this promising method.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>PTM-Psi on the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed an advanced computational framework to accelerate the study of the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structures and interactions (PTM-Psi) using asynchronous, loosely coupled workflows on the Azure Quantum Elements Cloud platform. We seamlessly integrate emerging cloud computing assets that further expand the scope and capability of PTM-Psi Python package by refactoring it into a cloud-compatible library. We employed a "workflow of workflows" approach wherein a parent workflow spawns one or more child workflows, managing them, and acting on their results. This approach enabled us to optimize resource allocation according to each workflow's needs, and allowed us to use the cloud heterogeneous architecture for the computational investigation of a combinatorial explosion of thiol protein PTMs on an exemplary protein megacomplex critical to the Calvin-Benson cycle of light-dependent sugar production in cyanobacteria. With PTM-Psi on the cloud, we transformed the pipeline for the thiol PTM analysis to achieve high throughput by leveraging the strengths of the cloud service. \ptmpsi\ on the cloud reduces operational complexity and lowers entry barriers to data interpretation with structural modeling for a redox proteomics mass spectrometry specialist.</description>

      <title>Entropic Clustering of Stickers Induces Aging in Biocondensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as aging.The emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.</description>
