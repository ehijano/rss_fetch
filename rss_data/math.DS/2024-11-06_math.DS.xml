      <title>Dynamics near homoclinic orbits to a saddle in four-dimensional systems with a first integral and a discrete symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariant 4-dimensional system of ODEs with a smooth first integral $H$ and a saddle equilibrium state $O$. We assume that there exists a transverse homoclinic orbit $\Gamma$ to $O$ that approaches $O$ along the nonleading directions. Suppose $H(O) = c$. In \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(c)$ was described. In particular, some criteria for the existence of the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of $\Gamma$ were given. In the current paper, we describe the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(h)$ for $h\neq c$ close to $c$. We prove that when $h &lt; c$, there exists a unique saddle periodic orbit in each level set $H^{-1}(h)$, and the forward (resp. backward) orbit of any point off the stable (resp. unstable) invariant manifold of this periodic orbit leaves a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We further show that when $h &gt; c$, the forward and backward orbits of any point in $H^{-1}(h)$ near $\Gamma$ leave a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We also prove analogous results for the scenario where two transverse homoclinics to $O$ (homoclinic figure-eight) exist. The results of this paper, together with \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, give a full description of the dynamics in a small open neighborhood of $\Gamma$ (and a small open neighborhood of a homoclinic figure-eight).</description>

      <title>Parabolic saddles and Newhouse domains in Celestial Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 70s McGehee introduced a compactification of the phase space of the restricted 3-body problem by gluing a manifold of periodic orbits "at infinity". Although from the dynamical point of view these periodic orbits are parabolic (the linearization of the Poincar\'{e} map is the identity matrix), one of them, denoted here by $O$, possesses stable and unstable manifolds which, moreover, separate the regions of bounded and unbounded motion.
  This observation prompted the investigation of the homoclinic picture associated to $O$, starting with the work of Alekseev and Moser. We continue this research and extend, to this degenerate setting, some classical results in the theory of homoclinic bifurcations. More concretely, we prove that there exist Newhouse domains $\mathcal N$ in parameter space (the ratio of masses of the bodies) and residual subsets $\mathcal R\subset \mathcal N$ for which the homoclinic class of $O$ has maximal Hausdorff dimension and is accumulated by generic elliptic periodic orbits.
  One of the main consequences of our work is the fact that, for a (locally) topologically large set of parameters of the restricted 3-body problem the union of its elliptic islands forms an unbounded subset of the phase space and, moreover, the closure of the set of generic elliptic periodic orbits contains hyperbolic sets with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to maximal. Other instances of the restricted $n$-body problem such as the Sitnikov problem and the case $n=4$ are also considered.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Stability, Bifurcation, and Chaos in Generalized Mackey-Glass Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mackey-Glass equation arises in the leukemia model. We generalize this equation to include fractional-order derivatives in two directions. The first generalization contains one whereas the second contains two fractional derivatives. Such generalizations improve the model because the nonlocal operators viz. fractional derivatives are more suitable for the natural systems. We present the detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of the proposed models. We observe stable orbits, periodic oscillations, and chaos in these models. The parameter space is divided into a variety of regions, viz. stable region (delay independent), unstable region, single stable region, and stability/instability switch. Furthermore, we propose a control method for chaos in these general equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Poincar\'e-Dulac singularities of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the analytic classification of a class of nilpotent singularities of holomorphic foliations in $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$, those exhibiting a Poincar\'e-Dulac type singularity in their reduction process. This analytic classification is based in the holonomy of a certain component of the exceptional divisor. Finally, as a consequence, we show that these singularities exhibit a formal analytic rigidity.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Star Motifs: Network Response to Link Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding efficient modifications to improve network functionality is a fundamental problem of scientific and industrial interest. We study the response of network dynamics against link modifications on a weakly connected directed graph consisting of two strongly connected components: an undirected star and an undirected cycle. We assume that there are directed edges starting from the cycle and ending at the star (master-slave formalism). We modify the graph by adding directed edges of arbitrarily large weights starting from the star and ending at the cycle (opposite direction of the cutset). We provide criteria (based on the sizes of the star and cycle, the coupling structure, and the weights of cutset and modification edges) that determine how the modification affects the spectral gap of the Laplacian matrix. We apply our approach to understand the modifications that either enhance or hinder synchronization in networks of chaotic Lorenz systems as well as R\"ossler. Our results show that the hindrance of collective dynamics due to link additions is not atypical as previously anticipated by modification analysis and thus allows for better control of collective properties.</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approaching the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</description>

      <title>Perfect kernel of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the space of subgroups of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS groups), that is, groups acting cocompactly on an oriented tree without inversion and with infinite cyclic vertex and edge stabilizers. Our results generalize the study of Baumslag-Solitar groups in [CGLMS22]. Given a GBS group G defined by a graph of groups whose existence is given by Bass-Serre theory, we associate to any subgroup of G an integer, which is a generalization of the phenotype defined in [CGLMS22]. This quantity is invariant under conjugation and allows us to decompose the perfect kernel of G into pieces which are invariant under conjugation and on which G acts highly topologically transitively. To achieve this, we interpret graphs of subgroups of G as "blown up and shrunk" Schreier graphs of transitive actions of G. We also describe the topology of the pieces which appear in the decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\lambda&gt;2$, we construct a substitution on an infinite alphabet which gives rise to a substitution tiling with inflation factor $\lambda$. In particular, we obtain the first class of examples of substitutive systems with transcendental inflation factors that possess usual dynamical properties enjoyed by primitive substitutions on finite alphabets. We show that both the associated subshift and tiling dynamical systems are strictly ergodic, which is related to the quasicompactness of the underlying substitution operator. We also provide an explicit substitution with transcendental inflation factor $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism and Perturbation Formulae for Quenched Random Open Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quenched thermodynamic formalism for open random dynamical systems generated by finitely branched, piecewise-monotone mappings of the interval. The openness refers to the presence of holes in the interval, which terminate trajectories once they enter. Our random driving is generated by an invertible, ergodic, measure-preserving transformation on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathscr{F},m)$. For each $\omega$ we associate a piecewise-monotone, surjective map $T_\omega$ and a hole $H_\omega\subset [0,1]$; the map and the hole generate the corresponding open transfer operator. In the first chapter we prove, for a contracting potential, that there exists a unique random conformal measure $\nu_\omega$ supported on the survivor set. We also prove the existence of a unique random invariant density $\phi_\omega$. These provide an ergodic random invariant measure $\mu=\nu \phi$ supported on the global survivor set. Further, we prove quasi-compactness of the transfer operator cocycle and exponential decay of correlations for $\mu$. The escape rate of $\nu$ is given by the difference of the expected pressures for the closed and open random systems. Finally, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the surviving set is equal to the unique zero of the expected pressure function for almost every fiber. In the second chapter we consider quasi-compact linear operator cocycles and their small perturbations. We prove an abstract fiberwise first-order formula for the leading Lyapunov multipliers. Our new machinery is deployed to create a spectral approach for a quenched extreme value theory that considers random dynamics and random observations. Finally, we prove quenched statistical limit theorems for random equilibrium states arising from contracting potentials. We illustrate the above theory with a variety of examples.</description>

      <title>Equivariance and partial observations in Koopman operator theory for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become an essential tool for data-driven analysis, prediction and control of complex systems. The main reason is the enormous potential of identifying linear function space representations of nonlinear dynamics from measurements. This equally applies to ordinary, stochastic, and partial differential equations (PDEs). Until now, with a few exceptions only, the PDE case is mostly treated rather superficially, and the specific structure of the underlying dynamics is largely ignored. In this paper, we show that symmetries in the system dynamics can be carried over to the Koopman operator, which allows us to significantly increase the model efficacy. Moreover, the situation where we only have access to partial observations (i.e., measurements, as is very common for experimental data) has not been treated to its full extent, either. Moreover, we address the highly-relevant case where we cannot measure the full state, where alternative approaches (e.g., delay coordinates) have to be considered. We derive rigorous statements on the required number of observables in this situation, based on embedding theory. We present numerical evidence using various numerical examples including the wave equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

Abstract: In this article we discuss the requirements needed in order to characterise the solution space of perturbed linear integro-differential Volterra convolution equations. We highlight in general how the pointwise behaviour of perturbation functions does not necessarily propagate through to the solution which the classical literature seems to suggest. To illustrate this general idea we show the Ces\`aro mean of the solution can converge even in cases when the Ces\`aro mean of the perturbation function diverges. Furthermore we provide a characterisation of when such convergence takes place and explicitly identify the limit in terms of the problem data. Additionally we prove how all results can also be applied to perturbed linear functional differential equations.</description>
