      <title>Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Characterizing far from equilibrium states of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the mathematical toolbox of the inverse scattering transform to study quantitatively the number of solitons in far from equilibrium one-dimensional systems described by the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We present a simple method to identify the discrete eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum and provide a extensive benchmark of its efficiency. Our method can be applied in principle to all physical systems described by the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation and allows to identify the solitons velocity distribution in numerical simulations and possibly experiments.</description>

      <title>Remote Nucleation and Stationary Domain Walls via Transition Waves in Tristable Magnetoelastic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a magnetoelastic lattice in which a localized external magnetic field, generated by an assembly of fixed magnets, tunes the potential landscape to create monostable, bistable, and tristable configurations. Focusing on the tristable potential, we numerically and experimentally confirm the existence of three distinct types of transition waves, each characterized by unique amplitudes and velocities, and establish a scaling law that governs their behavior. We also examine how these transition waves interact with the system's finite boundaries. Furthermore, by adjusting the potential symmetry through the localized external field, we investigate wave collision dynamics. In lattices with asymmetric potentials, the collision of similar transition waves leads to the remote nucleation of a third phase. In symmetric potentials, the collision of dissimilar transition waves results in the formation of a stationary domain wall, with its width tuned by the shape of the tristable potential well.</description>

      <title>Spiral waves speed up cell cycle oscillations in the frog cytoplasm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiral waves are a well-known phenomenon in excitable media, playing critical roles in biological systems such as cardiac tissues, where they are involved in arrhythmias, and in slime molds, where they guide collective cell migration. However, their presence in the cytoplasm of cells has not been reported to date. In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus laevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find that the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle nearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that this behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by time-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly observed target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights into their dynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Single and merger soliton dynamics in scalar field dark matter with and without self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI and make our amended code public. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and postmerger objects, and fit them to analytical functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of postmergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as postmergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</description>

      <title>Energy Scalability Limits of Dissipative Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>
