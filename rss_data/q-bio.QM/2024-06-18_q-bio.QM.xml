      <title>Horizon-wise Learning Paradigm Promotes Gene Splicing Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying gene splicing is a core and significant task confronted in modern collaboration between artificial intelligence and bioinformatics. Past decades have witnessed great efforts on this concern, such as the bio-plausible splicing pattern AT-CG and the famous SpliceAI. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the task of gene splicing identification, named Horizon-wise Gene Splicing Identification (H-GSI). The proposed H-GSI follows the horizon-wise identification paradigm and comprises four components: the pre-processing procedure transforming string data into tensors, the sliding window technique handling long sequences, the SeqLab model, and the predictor. In contrast to existing studies that process gene information with a truncated fixed-length sequence, H-GSI employs a horizon-wise identification paradigm in which all positions in a sequence are predicted with only one forward computation, improving accuracy and efficiency. The experiments conducted on the real-world Human dataset show that our proposed H-GSI outperforms SpliceAI and achieves the best accuracy of 97.20\%.

      <title>NovoBench: Benchmarking Deep Learning-based De Novo Peptide Sequencing Methods in Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the high-throughput analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Many deep learning methods have been developed for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing task, i.e., predicting the peptide sequence for the observed mass spectrum. However, two key challenges seriously hinder the further advancement of this important task. Firstly, since there is no consensus for the evaluation datasets, the empirical results in different research papers are often not comparable, leading to unfair comparison. Secondly, the current methods are usually limited to amino acid-level or peptide-level precision and recall metrics. In this work, we present the first unified benchmark NovoBench for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, which comprises diverse mass spectrum data, integrated models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Recent impressive methods, including DeepNovo, PointNovo, Casanovo, InstaNovo, AdaNovo and $\pi$-HelixNovo are integrated into our framework. In addition to amino acid-level and peptide-level precision and recall, we evaluate the models' performance in terms of identifying post-tranlational modifications (PTMs), efficiency and robustness to peptide length, noise peaks and missing fragment ratio, which are important influencing factors while seldom be considered. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current methods, report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate future research and application.</description>

      <title>Uncovering sequence diversity from a known protein structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present InvMSAFold, a method for generating a diverse set of protein sequences that fold into a single structure. For a given structure, InvMSAFold defines a probability distribution over the space of sequences, capturing the amino acid covariances observed in Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) of homologous proteins. This allows for the generation of highly diverse protein sequences while preserving structural and functional integrity. We show that the higher diversity of sampled sequences translates into higher diversity in biochemical properties, pointing to exciting prospects for the applicability of our method in fields like protein design by providing diverse starting points.</description>

      <title>Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder's latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule's neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction against up to 19 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Temporal Prediction of Continuous Disease Trajectories and Treatment Effects Using Neural SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized medicine based on medical images, including predicting future individualized clinical disease progression and treatment response, would have an enormous impact on healthcare and drug development, particularly for diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)) with long term, complex, heterogeneous evolutions and no cure. In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</description>

      <title>Dual-trigger release of berberine chloride from the Gelatin/Perfluorohexane core-shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14172</link>

Abstract: Background: The development of smart nanocarriers that enable controlled drug release in response to internal and external triggers is an emerging approach for targeted therapy. This study focused on designing pH-sensitive, ultrasound-responsive gelatin/perfluorohexane (PFH) nanodroplets loaded with berberine chloride as a model drug. Results:The nanodroplets were prepared using an emulsion technique and optimized by varying process parameters like homogenization rate, polymer concentration, surfactant, drug, and perfluorocarbon content. The optimal formulation yielded nanodroplets with a particle size of 281.7 nm, a drug encapsulation efficiency of 66.8+- 1.7%, and a passive drug release of 15.4+- 0.2% within 24 hours. Characterization confirmed successful encapsulation and pH-responsive behavior. Ultrasound stimulation significantly enhanced drug release, with 150 kHz being more effective than 1 MHz in triggering acoustic droplet vaporization while minimizing heat generation. After 10 minutes of radiation, the optimal formulation showed 89.4% cumulative drug release. The nanodroplets displayed stability over one month at 4{\deg}C. Conclusions: Overall, the dual-triggered nanodroplets demonstrate excellent potential for controlled delivery and targeted release of berberine chloride.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12235v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</description>
