      <title>Weak* decomposition and Radon-Nikodym theorem for quantum expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum expectation is a positive linear functional of norm one on a non-commutative probability space (i.e., a C*-algebra). For a given pair of quantum expectations $\mu$ and $\lambda$ on a non-commutative probability space $A$, we propose a definition for weak* continuity and weak* singularity of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. Then, using the theory of von Neumann algebras, we obtain the natural weak* continuous and weak* singular parts of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ satisfies a weak tracial property known as the KMS condition, we show that our weak* decomposition coincides with the Arveson-Gheondea-Kavruk Lebesgue (AGKL) decomposition. This equivalence allows us to compute the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. We also discuss the possibility of extending our results to the positive linear functionals defined on the Cuntz-Toeplitz operator system.</description>

      <title>Generalised Twisted Groupoids and their C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid $G$, and twist by a more general locally compact Hausdorff abelian group $\Gamma$ rather than the complex unit circle $\mathbb{T}$. We investigate the construction of $C^*$-algebras in analogue to the usual twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras, and we show that, in fact, any $\Gamma$-twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra is isomorphic to a usual twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Real Non-Commutative Convexity I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative convex sets, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir.. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We give many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated noncommutative (nc) convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <title>Rieffel projections and 2-by-2 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a compact space $Y$, we view $C(Y\times S^1)$ as the crossed product $C(Y)\rtimes\mathbb{Z}$, with $\mathbb{Z}$ acting trivially. This allows us to study Rieffel projections in $M_2(C(Y\times S^1))$: we characterize them and compute their image under the projection $\partial_0:K_0(C(Y\times S^1))\rightarrow K_1(C(Y))$. We provide a new Rieffel projection in $M_2(C(\mathbb{T}^2))$, different from Loring's one, and involving only trigonometric polynomials plus the square root of $2-e^{2\pi i\theta}-e^{-2\pi i\theta}$. We give applications of this projection, e.g. explicit generators for the K-theory of $C(\mathbb{T}^3)$. Finally, we prove that, if a Banach algebra completion $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}^n]$ is continuously contained in $C(\mathbb{T}^n)$ and such that the Fourier series of $(2-e^{2\pi i\theta_j}-e^{-2\pi i\theta_j})^{1/2}\;(j=1,...,n)$ converges in $\mathcal{B}$, then the inclusion $\mathcal{B}\hookrightarrow C(\mathbb{T}^n)$ induces isomorphisms in K-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any depth 2 subfactor with a simple first relative commutant has a unitary orthonormal basis. As a pleasant consequence, we produce new elements in the set of Popa's relative dimension of projections for such subfactors. We also construct infinitely many new elements in the set of relative dimension of projections for subfactors arising from complex Hadamard matrices and bi-unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Conjugate pairs of Hadamard subfactors and vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any two Hadamard subfactors arising from a pair of distinct complex Hadamard matrices of order 3 are either equal or conjugate by a unitary in the relative commutant of their intersection. Moreover, when the Hadamard subfactors are not equal, we prove the factoriality of their intersection, and it turns out to be a vertex model subfactor. We compute the first relative commutant and characterize this subfactor by identifying it with a particular type of Krishnan-Sunder subfactor. A few key invariants, including the Pimsner-Popa probabilistic number, the angle, and the Connes-St{\o}rmer relative entropy for the pair of Hadamard subfactors are computed to understand their relative position.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

Abstract: We study nonunital $C^*$-algebras such that for any element there exists a local unit and prove that in such algebras there are no frames. This fact was previously known only for commutative algebras. Among other results, we establish some necessary properties of frames in $C^*$-algebras (which are of independent interest in the noncommutative topology), and consider several examples of $C^*$-algebras that are new in this context.</description>

      <title>Selfless reduced free product $C^*$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study selflessness in the general setting of reduced free products of $C^*$-algebras. Towards this end, we develop a suitable theory of rapid decay for filtrations in arbitrary $C^*$-probability spaces. We provide several natural examples and permanence properties of this phenomenon. By using this framework in combination with von Neumann algebraic techniques involving approximate forms of orthogonality, we are able to prove selflessness for general families of reduced free product $C^*$-algebras. As an instance of our results, we prove selflessness and thus strict comparison for the canonical $C^*$-algebras generated by Voiculescu's free semicircular systems. Our results also provide new examples of purely infinite reduced free products.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>
