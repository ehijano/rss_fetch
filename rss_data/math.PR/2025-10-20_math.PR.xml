      <title>Universality of rational canonical form for random matrices over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $\epsilon$-balanced with $\epsilon\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. Our method builds on a function field version of Wood's surjection moment method (arXiv:1504.04391), and in particular it recovers, as a special case, the uniform model proved earlier by Fulman in his 1997 thesis.</description>

      <title>Tamed Euler approximation for fully superlinear growth McKean-Vlasov SDE and their particle systems: sharp rates for strong propagation of chaos, convergence and ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) whose drift and diffusion coefficients are of superlinear growth in \textit{all} their variables thus also superlinear in the measure component (the meaning is specified in the body of the paper). We address the finite and infinite time horizon case.
  Our contribution is fourfold.
  (a) We establish well-posedness for this class of equations and the corresponding interacting particle system.
  (b) We prove two propagation of chaos results with explicit $L^2$-convergence rates: the first, is a general one where the rate degrades as the system's dimension $d$ increases; the second, attains the sharp rate $N^{-1/2}$ (in particle number $N$) uniformly over the dimension $d$ at the cost of a Vlasov kernel structure that is general and of superlinear growth for the measure dependency -- the latter's proof fully avoids the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality argument.
  (c) Unlike existing works -- based on semi-implicit schemes or truncated Euler schemes -- we propose a fully explicit tamed Euler scheme that has reduced computational cost (comparatively).
  The explicit scheme is shown to converge in strong $L^p$-sense with rate $1/2$ (in timestep).
  (d) Lastly, we establish exponential ergodicity properties and long-time behavior for the MV-SDE, the corresponding interacting particle system, and the tamed scheme. The latter result is, to the best of our knowledge, fully novel.</description>

      <title>Liouville quantum gravity: from random planar maps to conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originating in theoretical physics, Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) has been an important topic in probability theory and mathematical physics in the past two decades. In this proceeding, we review two aspects of this topic. The first is that LQG describes the random conformal geometry of the scaling limit of random planar maps. We highlight the convergence of random planar maps under discrete conformal embedding, where couplings between LQG and the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) play a key role. The second aspect is the connection to conformal field theory (CFT). Here we highlight the interplay between Liouville CFT and the SLE/LQG coupling, the CFT description of 2D quantum gravity coupled with conformal matter, and applications to SLE and 2D statistical physics. We conclude with several open questions and future directions.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness of stable-driven McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with Besov interaction kernel of non-positive regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness results for time-inhomogeneous stable-driven McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with a convolution drift where the interaction kernel belongs to some Lebesgue-Besov space. The novelty of this work is that we manage to go below -1 in space regularity for such a kernel. This is achieved under additional smoothness conditions on the initial data and divergence conditions on the kernel. The proof heavily relies on a suitable product rule in Besov space. We prove smoothing properties of the law, which allow us to have the drift in a Lebesgue-Besov space of non-positive regularity.</description>

      <title>The hard membrane process and transport barriers of turbulent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenon of transport barriers in fusion plasma devices, we write a mathematical model of heat dispersion in a turbulent fluid with a transport barrier, properly idealized; in a scaling limit of the turbulence model with separation of scales we get a heat equation with space-dependent diffusion coefficient, poorly diffusing near the barrier; then we investigate the scaling limit when the diffused barrier converges to a sharp separating surface and describe the limit by means of the stochastic process called Brownian motion with hard membrane.</description>

      <title>Free energy Wasserstein gradient flow and their particle counterparts: toy model, (degenerate) PL inequalities and exit times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finite dimension, the long-time and metastable behavior of a gradient flow perturbated by a small Brownian noise is well understood. A similar situation arises when a Wasserstein gradient flow over a space of probability measure is approximated by a system of mean-field interacting particles, but classical results do not apply in these infinite-dimensional settings. This work is concerned with the situation where the objective function of the optimization problem contains an entropic penalization, so that the particle system is a Langevin diffusion process. We consider a very simple class of models, for which the infinite-dimensional behavior is fully characterized by a finite-dimensional process. The goal is to have a flexible class of benchmarks to fix some objectives, conjectures and (counter-)examples for the general situation. Inspired by the systematic study of these toy models, one application is presented on the continuous Curie-Weiss model in a symmetric double-well potential. We show that, at the critical temperature, although the $N$-particle Gibbs measure does not satisfy a uniform-in-$N$ standard log-Sobolev inequality (the optimal constant growing like $\sqrt{N}$), it does satisfy a more general Lojasiewicz inequality uniformly in $N$, inducing uniform polynomial long-time convergence rates, propagation of chaos at stationarity and uniformly in time, and creation of chaos.</description>

      <title>Random convex chains through the lens of analytic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. The lower boundary of the convex hull of $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, together with $n$ independent uniformly distributed random points in $T$, is called a random convex chain and denoted by $T_n$. We study the random variable $f_0(T_n)$, the number of vertices of this chain. Our first result gives an explicit expression for the bivariate generating function of the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$ in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Building on this analytic representation, we apply a careful singularity analysis to derive a variety of limit theorems for $f_0(T_n)$, including a quantitative central limit theorem, a large deviation principle as well as a precise asymptotics for the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$. Conceptually, our results establish a novel bridge between stochastic geometry and methods from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>LAN Property for the Drift and Hurst Paramters in The Mixed Fractional O-U Process with Continuous Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the Local Asymptotical normality for the joint drift parameter and Hurst parameter $H&gt;3/4$ in the mixed fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Different from the only estimation of the drift parameter when $H$ is known, we will use the fact that the mixed fractional Brownian motion is a semimartingale with its own filtering when $H&gt;3/4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate rigidity phenomena in one-dimensional point processes. We show that the existence of an $L^1$ transport map from a stationary lattice or the Lebesgue measure to a point process is sufficient to guarantee the properties of Number-Rigidity and Cyclic-Factor. We then apply this result to non-singular Riesz gases with parameter $s\in(-2,-1]$, defined in infinite volume as accumulation points of stationarized finite-volume Riesz gases. This includes, for $s=-1$, the well-known one-dimensional Coulomb gas (also called Jellium plasma, or the one-component 1D plasma).</description>

      <title>Global and local limits for products of rectangular Ginibre matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate singular value statistics for products of independent rectangular complex Ginibre matrices. When the rectangularity parameters of the matrices converge to a common limit in the asymptotic regime, the limiting spectral density is derived, and the local statistics in the bulk are shown to be governed by the universal sine kernel. This generalizes the classical results for products of square Ginibre matrices to a specific class of rectangular matrix products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We further explore a connection initially unveiled in Iksanov (2025) between critical beta-splitting trees and infinite `balls-in-boxes' schemes. Using the connection, we derive a new joint central limit theorem for components of the height of a leaf chosen uniformly at random in the discrete version of a critical beta-splitting tree. Also, we obtain a joint central limit theorem for the heights in the discrete and continuous versions of a critical beta-splitting tree.</description>

      <title>Multivariate subexponentiality and interplay of insurance and financial risks in a renwal risk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multivariate risk model with common renewal process, while the logarithmic returns of the insurers investment portfolio, are described by a Levy process. In the two main results are established an asymptotic expression for the entrance probability of the discounted aggregate claims in some rare sets x A. This asymptotic expression highlights the multivariate linear single big jump principle in asymptotic behavior of these probabilities. In the first result, we are restricted in the case where the insurer makes risk free investments, and hence we consider a non-negative Levy process. We assume that the claim vectors follow a distribution from a class, introduced here, and represents a negligibly smaller subclass of multivariate subexponential distributions, since the additional requirement for positive lower Karamata index, looks as a mild condition. Further, we consider that the insurance and financial risks, satisfy a weak dependence structure. In the second result, we allow arbitrarily dependence between the two risks, and we assume that the distribution of their product, at each renewal epoch, belongs to the intersection of the class of multivariate subexponential positively decreasing distributions with multivariate dominatedly varying distributions. In this theorem we also permit risky investment, putting a condition to Laplace exponent of the Levy process. We also note that even in the special one-dimensional subcase the main results are new. Furthermore, we present two examples, where we demand only conditions for the marginal distributions of both risks and their dependence structure. Both examples, under the restriction on multivariate regularly varying distributions provide more explicit and elegant relations in relation with that established in the main results.</description>

      <title>Precise large deviations in geometric last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the last passage time in geometric last passage percolation (LPP). As the system size increases, we derive precise large deviation probabilities -- up to and including the constant terms -- for both the lower and upper tails. A key step in proving these results is to establish a duality formula that reformulates the LPP problem in terms of the largest eigenvalue in the Jacobi unitary ensemble (JUE). In addition, we establish a second duality formula, which relates the LPP problem to the truncated unitary ensemble (TUE). Using this, we also derive asymptotics for the moments of the absolute value of characteristic polynomials of the TUE, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>$G$ Method and Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an extension of the $G$ method, with results, the extension and results being partly suggested by the finite Markov chains and specially by the finite-time consensus problem for the DeGroot model and that for the DeGroot model on distributed systems. For the (homogeneous and nonhomogeneous) DeGroot model, using the $G$ method, a result for reaching a partial or total consensus in a finite time is given. Further, we consider a special submodel/case of the DeGroot model, with examples and comments -- a subset/subgroup property is discovered. For the DeGroot model on distributed systems, using the $G$ method too, we have a result for reaching a partial or total (distributed) consensus in a finite time similar to that for the DeGroot model for reaching a partial or total consensus in a finite time. Then we show that for any connected graph having $2^{m}$ vertices, $m\geq 1,$ and a spanning subgraph isomorphic to the $m$-cube graph, distributed averaging is performed in $m$ steps -- this result can be extended -- research work -- for any graph with $n_{1}n_{2}...n_{t}$ vertices under certain conditions, where $t,$ $n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{t}\geq 2,$ and, in this case, distributed averaging is performed in $t$ steps.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems for Drift and Entropy of Random Walks on Free Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider a natural class of random walks on free products of graphs, which arise as convex combinations of random walks on the single factors. From the works of Gilch [6,7] it is well-known that for these random walks the asymptotic entropy as well as the drift w.r.t. the natural transition graph distance and also w.r.t. the word length exist. The aim of this article is to formulate three central limit theorems with respect to both drift definitions and the entropy. In the case that the random walk depends on finitely many parameters we show that the corresponding variances in the central limit theorems w.r.t. both drifts vary real-analytically in terms of these parameters, while the variance in the central limit theorem w.r.t. the entropy varies real-analytically at least in the case of free products of finite graphs.</description>

      <title>Local pathwise solutions and regularization by noises for the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem associated with the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel (SHKS) equation featuring multiplicative noises on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. First, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of pathwise solutions to the SHKS equation within Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}+1$, under appropriate regularity conditions imposed on the nonlinear multiplicative noises. Subsequently, we explore two global results pertaining to noise-induced regularization: (1) The first result demonstrates that for polynomial-type nonlinear noises, when the noise intensity parameters meet specific threshold conditions, the SHKS equation possesses a unique pathwise solution for large initial data with probability one. This finding provides a partial answer to a question that has remained unresolved in the deterministic setting; (2) The second result reveals that, for small initial data, or equivalently when dealing with linear multiplicative noises with sufficiently large intensity (allowed to be negative), the SHKS equation admits a unique pathwise solution with high probability.</description>

Abstract: Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.</description>

      <title>Probability equivalent level for CoVaR and VaR in bivariate Student-\textit{t} copulas with application to foreign exchange risk monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the "probability-equivalent level of VaR and CoVaR" (PELCoV) methodology to accommodate bivariate risks modeled by a Student-t copula, relaxing the strong dependence assumptions of earlier approaches and enhancing the framework's ability to capture tail dependence and asymmetric co-movements. While the theoretical results are developed in a static setting, we implement them dynamically to track evolving risk spillovers over time. We illustrate the practical relevance of our approach through an application to the foreign exchange market, monitoring the USD/GBP exchange rate with the USD/EUR series as an auxiliary early warning indicator over the period 1999-2024. Our results highlight the potential of the extended PELCoV framework to detect early signs of risk underestimation during periods of financial stress.</description>

Abstract: An approximation method for construction of optimal strategies in the bid \&amp; ask limit order book in the high-frequency trading (HFT) is studied. The basis is the article by M. Avellaneda \&amp; S. Stoikov 2008, in which certain seemingly serious gaps have been found; in the present paper they are carefully corrected. However, a bit surprisingly, our corrections do not change the main answer in the cited paper, so that, in fact, the gaps turn out to be unimportant. An explanation of this effect is offered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Euler's type method with the equidistant step size is proposed for a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations driven by the multiplicative noise and the strong convergence rate that is related to the parameter of the time changing process is obtained. Such a observation of the convergence rate is significantly different from those existing results that employ methods with the random step size. The polynomial stability in the mean square sense of the numerical method is also studied, which is in line with the asymptotic behavior of the underlying equation.</description>

      <title>Local regression on path spaces with signature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression and classification for path-valued data. We introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance. Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In connection with recent work on smallest gaps, C.~Charlier proves that the 1-point function of a suitable planar Coulomb system $\{z_j\}_1^n$, in the determinantal case with respect to an external potential $Q(z)$, admits the expansion, as $n\to\infty$, $$R_n\bigg(z_0+\frac t {\sqrt{2n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}}\nu(z_0)\bigg)=n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)\frac {\operatorname{erfc} t}2+\sqrt{n\partial\bar{\partial} Q(z_0)}\,C(z_0;t)+\mathcal{O}(\log^3 n).$$ Here $t$ is a real parameter, $z_0$ is a regular boundary point of the (connected) Coulomb droplet and $\nu(z_0)$ is the outwards unit normal; the coefficient $C(z_0;t)$ has an apriori structure depending on a number of parameters.
  In this note we identify the parameters and obtain a formula for $C(z_0;t)$ in potential theoretic and geometric terms. Our formula holds for a large class of potentials such that the droplet is connected with smooth boundary. Our derivation uses the well known expectation of fluctuations formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a model-theoretic representation theorem for the distribution of an ergodic exchangeable $k$-uniform hypergraph: every such measure arises as the pushforward of the countably-iterated Morley product of a global Borel-definable Keisler measure over the countable universal homogeneous $k$-uniform hypergraph. We show this by starting with a Borel $k$-hypergraphon $W$ and constructing a Keisler measure $\mu_{W}$ such that generic sampling with respect to $\mu_{W}$ yields the same invariant measure as does the standard hypergraphon sampling procedure with respect to $W$. When $k = 2$, our results give a new representation theorem for ergodic exchangeable graphs via Keisler measures over a monster model of the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet eigenfunction and heat kernel estimates on annular domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Euclidean boxes, we consider "thin" annular domains of the form $U=(a,b)\times U_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ in polar coordinates, where the spherical base $U_0\subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is an inner uniform domain. We show that, with respect to the measure $\varphi_U^2$ determined by the principal Dirichlet Laplacian eigenfunction $\varphi_U$, such annular domains satisfy volume doubling and Poincar\'e inequalities uniformly over all locations and scales. This implies sharp Dirichlet heat kernel estimates expressed in terms of $\varphi_U$. Our results hold uniformly over the collection of all annuli in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also give matching two-sided bounds for the first Dirichlet Laplacian eigenfunction and eigenvalue for some annular domains including annuli in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Moreover, we prove eigenfunction inequalities for $\varphi_U$ under domain perturbations of $U$. The proofs of our main results utilize eigenfunction comparison techniques due to Lierl and the authors (arXiv:1210.4586, arXiv:2504.18783), small scale $\varphi_U^2$-Poincar\'e inequalities, as well as a discretization technique of Coulhon and Saloff-Coste. Finally, our methods also imply uniform Neumann heat kernel estimates for thin annular domains.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Descriptions of Open Systems of Complex Chemical Reactions with Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of a complex system of nonlinear chemical reactions is a primary language of chemistry that includes chemical engineering and cellular biochemistry. Its significance as an analytical framework, however, has not been fully appreciated outside the community of physical chemists. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the kinetics and Gibbsian thermodynamics of chemical reactions in a spatially homogeneous aqueous solution with a multiscale perspective on complex systems. From the microscopic level of single reaction events which are purely stochastic in continuous time, one at a time among a set of molecules, to the macroscopic chemical reaction systems in bulk in terms of deterministic rate equations, the mathematical descriptions of kinetic models for chemical reactions at different levels are presented in detail, with rigorous mathematical justifications presented. In parallel with the kinetics of chemical reactions, the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems and the stochastic thermodynamics along reactions trajectories are reviewed thoroughly. As a novel feature, the mathematical theory of large deviations is shown to play a pivotal role in the thermodynamics of chemical reactions in equilibrium and in irreversible processes. This review is expected to stimulate interests in and help defining multiscale phenomena and nonequilibrium thermodynamics in many research fields on population dynamics of interacting species using chemical reactions as an analytic paradigm.</description>

      <title>Formation of clusters and coarsening in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the clustering behavior of weakly interacting diffusions under the influence of sufficiently localized attractive interaction potentials on the one-dimensional torus. We describe how this clustering behavior is closely related to the presence of discontinuous phase transitions in the mean-field PDE. For local attractive interactions, we employ a new variant of the strict Riesz rearrangement inequality to prove that all global minimizers of the free energy are either uniform or single-cluster states, in the sense that they are symmetrically decreasing.
  We analyze different timescales for the particle system and the mean-field (McKean-Vlasov) PDE, arguing that while the particle system can exhibit coarsening by both coalescence and diffusive mass exchange between clusters, the clusters in the mean-field PDE are unable to move and coarsening occurs via the mass exchange of clusters. By introducing a new model for this mass exchange, we argue that the PDE exhibits dynamical metastability. We conclude by presenting careful numerical experiments that demonstrate the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an inhomogeneous variant of random 2-SAT. Each variable $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is assigned a type from a state space $\Lambda$, independently at random. Clause inclusion is governed by a symmetric measurable kernel $W$ on $(\Lambda \times \{+,-\})^2$, in analogy with the inhomogeneous random graph model of Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan: given literals $\ell_i\in\{v_i,\neg v_i\}$ and $\ell_j\in\{v_j,\neg v_j\}$, the clause $\{\ell_i,\ell_j\}$ appears with probability $W(\mathrm{type}(\ell_i),\mathrm{type}(\ell_j))/(2n)$. In particular, for a variable $v_i$ of type $x\in\Lambda$, the slices $W((+,x),\cdot)$ and $W((-,x),\cdot)$ describe how $v_i$ and $\neg v_i$ interact with other literals.
  We identify a parameter $\rho^*(W)$, defined as the spectral radius of an integral operator derived from $W$, and show that $\rho^*(W)&lt;1$ and $\rho^*(W)&gt;1$ correspond to asymptotically almost surely satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances, respectively. The satisfiability threshold of homogeneous random 2-SAT is long known to appear at the ratio $1$ between the number of the clauses and the number of the variables which corresponds to $W \equiv 1$ and clause density $1/(2n)$. Our result extends this classical result to a broad class of models controlled by types of variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapted or causal transport theory aims to extend classical optimal transport from probability measures to stochastic processes. On a technical level, the novelty is to restrict to couplings which are bicausal, i.e. satisfy a property which reflects the temporal evolution of information in stochastic processes. We show that in the case of absolutely continuous marginals, the set of bicausal couplings is obtained precisely as the closure of the set of (bi-) adapted processes. That is, we obtain an analogue of the classical result on denseness of Monge couplings in the set of Kantorovich transport plans: bicausal transport plans represent the relaxation of adapted mappings in the same manner as Kantorovich transport plans are the appropriate relaxation of Monge-maps.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a general class of models for swarming/self-collective behaviour in domains with boundaries. The model is expressed as a stochastic system of interacting particles subject to both reflecting boundary condition and common environmental noise. We rigorously derive its corresponding macroscopic mean-field equation, which is a new type of stochastic partial differential equation due to the presence of common noise. The approach relies on a compactness argument, in which we first establish the tightness of the empirical measures associated with the particle system and then demonstrate that the time marginal of the limit measure is a solution to the mean-field equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an individual-based stochastic spatial epidemic model where the number of locations and the number of individuals at each location both grow to infinity. Each individual is associated with a random infection-age dependent infectivity function. Individuals are infected through interactions across the locations with heterogeneous effects. The epidemic dynamics can be described using a time-space representation for the the total force of infection, the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infected individuals that are infected at each time and have been infected for a certain amount of time, as well as the number of recovered individuals. We prove a functional law of large numbers for these time-space processes, and in the limit, we obtain a set of time-space integral equations. We then derive the PDE models from the limiting time-space integral equations, in particular, the density (with respect to the infection age) of the time-age-space integral equation for the number of infected individuals tracking the age of infection satisfies a linear PDE in time and age with an integral boundary condition. These integral equation and PDE limits can be regarded as dynamics on graphon under certain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study unique solvability for one dimensional stochastic pressure equation with diffusion coefficient given by the Wick exponential of log-correlated Gaussian fields. We prove well-posedness for Dirichlet, Neumann and periodic boundary data, and the initial value problem, covering the cases of both the Wick renormalization of the diffusion and of point-wise multiplication. We provide explicit representations for the solutions in both cases, characterized by the $S$-transform and the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Dynamic Concave Utilities via BSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic concave utility (or the dynamic convex risk measure) of an unbounded endowment is studied and represented as the value process in the unique solution of a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with an unbounded terminal value, with the help of our recent existence and uniqueness results on unbounded solutions of scalar BSDEs whose generators have a linear, super-linear, sub-quadratic or quadratic growth. Moreover, the infimum in the dynamic concave utility is proved to be attainable. The Fenchel-Legendre transform (dual representation) of convex functions, the de la Vall\'{e}e-Poussin theorem, and Young's and Gronwall's inequalities constitute the main ingredients of the dual representation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decay property of a special class of $d$-dimensional Markov processes. The exact value of the decay parameter $\lambda_{\mathcal{C}}$ is obtained by using a new method.

Abstract: This paper concentrates on the limit behavior of discrete-time branching process with circular mechanism. Three types of limit behaviour of discrete-time branching process with circular mechanism are given explicitly under various moment conditions on branching rates.

Abstract: Recommendation systems are pivotal in aiding users amid vast online content. Broutin, Devroye, Lugosi, and Oliveira proposed Subtractive Random Forests (\textsc{surf}), a model that emphasizes temporal user preferences. Expanding on \textsc{surf}, we introduce a model for a multi-choice recommendation system, enabling users to select from two independent suggestions based on past interactions. We evaluate its effectiveness and robustness across diverse scenarios, incorporating heavy-tailed distributions for time delays. By analyzing user topic evolution, we assess the system's consistency. Our study offers insights into the performance and potential enhancements of multi-choice recommendation systems in practical settings.</description>

      <title>On the number of elements beyond the ones actually observed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a variant of the birth and death chain with constant intensities, originally introduced by
  Bruno de Finetti way back in 1957, is revisited. This fact is also underlined by the choice of the title,
  which is clearly a literal translation of the original one. Characteristic of the variant is that it
  allows negative jumps of any magnitude. And this, as explained in the paper, might be useful in offering
  some insight into the issue, arising in numerous situations, of inferring the number of the undetected
  elements of a given population. One thinks, for example, of problems concerning abundance or richness of
  species.
  The author's purpose is twofold: to align the original de Finetti's construction with the modern,
  well-established theory of the continuous-time Markov chains with discrete state space and show how it
  could be used to make probabilistic previsions on the number of the unseen elements of a population.
  With the aim of enhancing the possible practical applications of the model, one discusses the statistical
  point estimation of the rates which characterize its infinitesimal description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate continuous diffusions on star graphs with sticky behavior at the vertex. These are Markov processes with continuous paths having a positive occupation time at the vertex. We characterize sticky diffusions as time-changed nonsticky diffusions by adapting the classical technique of It{\^o} and McKean. We prove a form of It{\^o} formula, also known as Freidlin-Sheu formula, for this type of process. As an intermediate step, we also obtain a stochastic differential equation satisfied by the radial component of the process. These results generalize those already known for sticky diffusions on a half-line and skew sticky diffusions on the real line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the survival probability and maximal displacement of a subcritical branching killed L\'{e}vy process $X$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\zeta$ denote the extinction time, $M_t$ be the maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$, and $M:=\sup_{t\ge 0}M_t$ be the all-time maximum. Under the assumption that the offspring distribution satisfies the $L\log L$ condition and some conditions on the spatial motion, we find the decay rate of the survival probability $\mathbb{P}_x(\zeta&gt;t)$ and the tail behavior of $M_t$ as $t\to\infty$. As a consequence, we establish a Yaglom-type theorem. We also find the asymptotic behavior of $\mathbb{P}_x(M&gt;y)$ as $y\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Strong local uniqueness for the vacant set of random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the the vacant set $\mathcal{V}^u$ of random interlacements on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. For varying intensity $u &gt; 0$, the connectivity properties of $\mathcal V^u$ undergo a percolation phase transition across a critical parameter $u_* \in (0,\infty)$. In this article, we prove that this phase transition is sharp in the supercritical phase $u &lt; u_*$. This follows from a certain strong local uniqueness property (SLU) introduced in the present work, which we prove $\mathcal{V}^u$ satisfies. In itself, this property furnishes the missing ingredient needed to deduce a number of desirable quenched results characterizing the large-scale geometry of the infinite cluster. Moreover, SLU entails a sought-after local and monotone criterion amenable to renormalization arguments below $u_*$.</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen bound for the Moment Estimation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model under fixed step size discrete observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process $\{X_t,\,t\geq 0\}$ driven by a fractional Brownian motion $B^H$ described by $d X_t=-\theta X_t dt+ d B_t^H,\, X_0=0$ with known parameter $H\in (0,\frac34)$ be observed at discrete time instants $t_k=kh, k=1,2,\dots, n $. If $\theta&gt;0$ and if the step size $h&gt;0$ is arbitrarily fixed, we derive Berry-Ess\'{e}en bound for the ergodic type estimator (or say the moment estimator) $\hat{\theta}_n$, i.e., the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of $\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}_n-\theta)$ and its limit distribution is bounded by a constant $C_{\theta, H,h}$ times $n^{-\frac12}$ and $ n^{4H-3}$ when $H\in (0,\,\frac58]$ and $H\in (\frac58,\,\frac34)$, respectively. This result greatly improve the previous result in literature where $h$ is forced to go zero. Moreover, we extend the Berry-Esseen bound to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model driven by a lot of Gaussian noises such as the sub-bifractional Brownian motion and others. A few ideas of the present paper come from Haress and Hu (2021), Sottinen and Viitasaari (2018), and Chen and Zhou (2021).</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ornstein--Zernike theory for the planar random-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an Ornstein--Zernike theory for the two-dimensional random-cluster model with $1 \leq q &lt;4$ that also applies in its near-critical regime. In particular, we prove an asymptotic formula for the two-point function which holds uniformly for~$p &lt; p_c$ and blends the subcritical and near-critical behaviours of the model.
  The analysis is carried out by studying the renewal properties of a subcritical percolation cluster, \emph{at the scale of the correlation length}. More precisely, we explore sequentially the cluster in a given direction, by slices of thickness comparable to the correlation length. We show that this exploration satisfies the properties of a {\em killed Markov renewal process} -- a class of processes that may be analysed independently and have Brownian behaviour. In addition to the two-point function estimate, we derive other consequences of the Ornstein--Zernike theory such as an invariance principle for the rescaled cluster and the strict convexity of the inverse correlation length -- all at the scale of the correlation length, uniformly in~$p&lt;p_c$.
  Finally, our approach differs from that of earlier papers of Campanino, Ioffe, Velenik and others, with the cluster being dynamically explored rather than constructed from its diamond decomposition.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness in Continuous-Time Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the elements of the theory of algorithmic randomness in continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Our main contribution is a rigorous, useful notion of what it means for an individual trajectory of a CTMC to be random. CTMCs have discrete state spaces and operate in continuous time. This, together with the fact that trajectories may or may not halt, presents challenges not encountered in more conventional developments of algorithmic randomness.
  Although we formulate algorithmic randomness in the general context of CTMCs, we are primarily interested in the computational} power of stochastic chemical reaction networks, which are special cases of CTMCs. This leads us to embrace situations in which the long-term behavior of a network depends essentially on its initial state and hence to eschew assumptions that are frequently made in Markov chain theory to avoid such dependencies.
  After defining the randomness of trajectories in terms of martingales (algorithmic betting strategies), we prove equivalent characterizations in terms of algorithmic measure theory and Kolmogorov complexity. As a preliminary application we prove that, in any stochastic chemical reaction network, every random trajectory with bounded molecular counts has the non-Zeno property that infinitely many reactions do not occur in any finite interval of time.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce and analyze a deep learning based approximation algorithm for SPDEs. Our approach employs neural networks to approximate the solutions of SPDEs along given realizations of the driving noise process. If applied to a set of simulated noise trajectories, it yields empirical distributions of SPDE solutions, from which functionals like the mean and variance can be estimated. We test the performance of the method on stochastic heat equations with additive and multiplicative noise as well as stochastic Black-Scholes equations with multiplicative noise and Zakai equations from nonlinear filtering theory. In all cases, the proposed algorithm yields accurate results with short runtimes in up to 100 space dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Low-Rank Problems Using Semidefinite Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-round strategy for low-rank optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme that obtains provably near-optimal solutions, building on the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. For a given $n \times m$ semi-orthogonal matrix, we derive a purely multiplicative approximation ratio for our algorithm, and show that it is never worse than $\max(2/(\pi m), 1/(\pi(\log (2m)+1)))$. We also show how to compute a tighter constant for a finite $(n,m)$ by solving a univariate optimization problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformation of probability measures on partitions, i.e., $q$-deformed random partitions. We in particular consider the $q$-Plancherel measure and show a determinantal formula for the correlation function using a $q$-deformation of the discrete Bessel kernel. We also investigate Riemann-Hilbert problems associated with the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and obtain $q$-Painlev\'{e} equations from the $q$-difference Lax formalism.</description>

      <title>A Method for Generating Connected Erdos-Renyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$. The method couples the graph exploration process to an inhomogeneous Poisson random walk, which yields an exact sampler that runs in $O(n)$ time in the sparse regime $p=c/n$. We also show how the method extends to the $G(n,M)$ model via an additional acceptance-rejection step.</description>

      <title>Score-based deterministic density sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based Transport Modeling for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$ given only its score $\nabla \log \pi$. Our method approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on $\mathrm{KL}(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. While having the same marginal distribution as Langevin dynamics, our method produces smooth deterministic trajectories, resulting in monotone noise-free convergence. We prove that our method dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: our method converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is often more sample efficient than its stochastic counterpart. Experiments on high-dimensional image data show that our method produces high-quality generations in as few as 15 steps and exhibits natural exploratory behavior. The memory and runtime scale linearly in the sample size.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments are consistent with this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, time-inconsistent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Sufficient digits and density estimation: A Bayesian nonparametric approach using generalized finite P\'olya trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for statistical modelling of a continuous random variable $X$ on $[0, 1)$, based on its digit representation $X=.X_1X_2\ldots$. In general, $X$ can be coupled with a latent random variable $N$ so that $(X_1,\ldots,X_N)$ becomes a sufficient statistics and $.X_{N+1}X_{N+2}\ldots$ is uniformly distributed. In line with this fact, and focusing on binary digits for simplicity, we propose a family of generalized finite P{\'o}lya trees that induces a random density for a sample, which becomes a flexible tool for density estimation. Here, the digit system may be random and learned from the data. We provide a detailed Bayesian analysis, including closed form expression for the posterior distribution which sidesteps the need of MCMC methods for posterior inference. We analyse the frequentist properties as the sample size increases, and provide sufficient conditions for consistency of the posterior distributions of the random density and $N$. We consider an extension to data spanning multiple orders of magnitude, and propose a prior distribution that encodes the so-called extended Newcomb-Benford law. Such a model shows promising results for density estimation of human-activity data. Our methodology is illustrated on several synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ on a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $\mathcal{X}$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups of bounded linear operators on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Transcendence Meets Normality: Construction of Transcendentally Normal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study real numbers $x$ for which $p(x)$ is (absolutely) normal for every non-constant integer-valued polynomial $p$. We call such numbers transcendentally normal. We prove that almost every real number is transcendentally normal and provide an explicit construction of such a number, based on Sierpinski's covering method and novel ideas involving the so-called stretch function. In the next step, we transform this construction into an algorithm that computes the digits of a t-normal number recursively in all integer bases. Moreover, we extend our covering approach to construct and compute LIL-normal numbers whose discrepancies are of the order predicted by the law of the iterated logarithm. We also take the opportunity to discuss several interesting open problems.</description>
