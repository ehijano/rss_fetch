      <title>Bernoulli amputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach to amputation, the process of introducing missing values to a complete dataset, is presented. It allows to construct missingness indicators in a flexible and principled way via copulas and Bernoulli margins and to incorporate dependence in missingness patterns. Besides more classical missingness models such as missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random, the approach is able to model structured missingness such as block missingness and, via mixtures, monotone missingness, which are patterns of missing data frequently found in real-life datasets. Properties such as joint missingness probabilities or missingness correlation are derived mathematically. The approach is demonstrated with mathematical examples and empirical illustrations in terms of a well-known dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation and is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>

      <title>Hybrid summary statistics: neural weak lensing inference beyond the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inference problems, we often have domain knowledge which allows us to define summary statistics that capture most of the information content in a dataset. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, where such physics-based summaries are augmented by a set of compressed neural summary statistics that are optimised to extract the extra information that is not captured by the predefined summaries. The resulting statistics are very powerful inputs to simulation-based or implicit inference of model parameters. We apply this generalisation of Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to parameter constraints from tomographic weak gravitational lensing convergence maps to find summary statistics that are explicitly optimised to complement angular power spectrum estimates. We study several dark matter simulation resolutions in low- and high-noise regimes. We show that i) the information-update formalism extracts at least $3\times$ and up to $8\times$ as much information as the angular power spectrum in all noise regimes, ii) the network summaries are highly complementary to existing 2-point summaries, and iii) our formalism allows for networks with smaller, physically-informed architectures to match much larger regression networks with far fewer simulations needed to obtain asymptotically optimal inference.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of the Conditional Value-at-Risk based Pickands Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pickands estimator for the extreme value index is beneficial due to its universal consistency, location, and scale invariance, which sets it apart from other types of estimators. However, similar to many extreme value index estimators, it is marked by poor asymptotic efficiency. Chen (2021) introduces a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)-based Pickands estimator, establishes its consistency, and demonstrates through simulations that this estimator significantly reduces mean squared error while preserving its location and scale invariance. The initial focus of this paper is on demonstrating the weak convergence of the empirical CVaR in functional space. Subsequently, based on the established weak convergence, the paper presents the asymptotic normality of the CVaR-based Pickands estimator. It further supports these theoretical findings with empirical evidence obtained through simulation studies.</description>
