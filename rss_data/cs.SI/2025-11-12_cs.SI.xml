      <title>Leveraging the Power of AI and Social Interactions to Restore Trust in Public Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of crowdsourced data has significantly reshaped social science, enabling extensive exploration of collective human actions, viewpoints, and societal dynamics. However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns. Although structural differences in social interaction graphs introduce some performance variability, our study achieves promising results in detecting ineligibility across diverse social and behavioral profiles, with accuracy exceeding 90% in some configurations.</description>

      <title>HiLoMix: Robust High- and Low-Frequency Graph Learning Framework for Mixing Address Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mixing services are increasingly being exploited by malicious actors for illicit transactions, mixing address association has emerged as a critical research task. A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.</description>

      <title>Measuring Value Expressions in Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08453v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value alignment of sociotechnical systems has become a central debate but progress in this direction requires the measurement of the expressions of values. While the rise of large-language models offer new possible opportunities for measuring expressions of human values (e.g., humility or equality) in social media data, there remain both conceptual and practical challenges in operationalizing value expression in social media posts: what value system and operationalization is most applicable, and how do we actually measure them? In this paper, we draw on the Schwartz value system as a broadly encompassing and theoretically grounded set of basic human values, and introduce a framework for measuring Schwartz value expressions in social media posts at scale. We collect 32,370 ground truth value expression annotations from N=1,079 people on 5,211 social media posts representative of real users' feeds. We observe low levels of inter-rater agreement between people, and low agreement between human raters and LLM-based methods. Drawing on theories of interpretivism - that different people will have different subjective experiences of the same situation - we argue that value expression is (partially) in the eye of the beholder. In response, we construct a personalization architecture for classifying value expressions. We find that a system that explicitly models these differences yields predicted value expressions that people agree with more than they agree with other people. These results contribute new methods and understanding for the measurement of human values in social media data.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization on Graph-Structured Data via Gaussian Processes with Spectral Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Political Text at Scale with Online Tensor LDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a topic modeling method that scales linearly to billions of documents. We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Shared Knowledge: Recursive Belief Reasoning in a Coordination Game with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common knowledge is crucial for safe group coordination. In its absence, humans must rely on shared knowledge, which is inherently limited in depth and therefore prone to coordination failures, because any finite-order knowledge attribution allows for an even higher order attribution that may change what is known by whom. In three separate experiments involving 802 participants, we investigate the extent to which humans can differentiate between common knowledge and nth-order shared knowledge. We designed a two-person coordination game with imperfect information to simplify the recursive game structure and higher-order uncertainties into a relatable everyday scenario. In this game, coordination for the highest payoff requires a specific fact to be common knowledge between players. However, this fact cannot become common knowledge in the game. The fact can at most be nth-order shared knowledge for some n. Our findings reveal that even at quite shallow depths of shared knowledge (low values of n), players behave as though they possess common knowledge, and claim similar levels of certainty in their actions, despite incurring significant penalties when falsely assuming guaranteed coordination. We term this phenomenon 'the curse of shared knowledge'. It arises either from the players' inability to distinguish between higher-order shared knowledge and common knowledge, or from their implicit assumption that their co-player cannot make this distinction.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels to Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>"Whose Side Are You On?" Estimating Ideology of Political and News Content Using Large Language Models and Few-shot Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to concerns about radicalization, filter bubbles, and content bias. Existing approaches to classifying ideology are limited in that they require extensive human effort, the labeling of large datasets, and are not able to adapt to evolving ideological contexts. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the political ideology of online content through in-context learning (ICL). Our extensive experiments involving demonstration selection in label-balanced fashion, conducted on three datasets comprising news articles and YouTube videos, reveal that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and traditional supervised methods. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of metadata (e.g., content source and descriptions) on ideological classification and discuss its implications. Finally, we show how providing the source for political and non-political content influences the LLM's classification.</description>

      <title>Effects of higher-order interactions and homophily on information access inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of information through socio-technical systems determines which individuals are the first to gain access to opportunities and insights. Yet, the pathways through which information flows can be skewed, leading to systematic differences in access across social groups. These inequalities remain poorly characterized in settings involving nonlinear social contagion and higher-order interactions that exhibit homophily. We introduce a enerative model for hypergraphs with hyperedge homophily, a hyperedge size-dependent property, and tunable degree distribution, called the $\texttt{H3}$ model, along with a model for nonlinear social contagion that incorporates asymmetric transmission between in-group and out-group nodes. Using stochastic simulations of a social contagion process on hypergraphs from the $\texttt{H3}$ model and diverse empirical datasets, we show that the interaction between social contagion dynamics and hyperedge homophily -- an effect unique to higher-order networks due to its dependence on hyperedge size -- can critically shape group-level differences in information access. By emphasizing how hyperedge homophily shapes interaction patterns, our findings underscore the need to rethink socio-technical system design through a higher-order perspective and suggest that dynamics-informed, targeted interventions at specific hyperedge sizes, embedded in a platform architecture, offer a powerful lever for reducing inequality.</description>

      <title>SugarTextNet: A Transformer-Based Framework for Detecting Sugar Dating-Related Content on Social Media with Context-Aware Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>
