      <title>Predicting the Temporal Dynamics of Prosthetic Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal implants are a promising treatment option for degenerative retinal disease. While numerous models have been developed to simulate the appearance of elicited visual percepts ("phosphenes"), these models often either focus solely on spatial characteristics or inadequately capture the complex temporal dynamics observed in clinical trials, which vary heavily across subjects and stimulus conditions. Here we introduce two computational models designed to accurately predict phosphene fading and persistence under varying stimulus conditions, cross-validated on behavioral data reported by nine users of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. Both models segment the time course of phosphene perception into discrete intervals, decomposing phosphene fading and persistence into either sinusoidal or exponential components. Our spectral model demonstrates state-of-the-art predictions of phosphene intensity over time (r = 0.7 across all participants). Overall, this study lays the groundwork for enhancing prosthetic vision by improving our understanding of phosphene temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Surface profile recovery from electromagnetic field with physics--informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics--informed neural networks (PINN) have shown their potential in solving both direct and inverse problems of partial differential equations. In this paper, we introduce a PINN-based deep learning approach to reconstruct one-dimensional rough surfaces from field data illuminated by an electromagnetic incident wave. In the proposed algorithm, the rough surface is approximated by a neural network, with which the spatial derivatives of surface function can be obtained via automatic differentiation and then the scattered field can be calculated via the method of moments. The neural network is trained by minimizing the loss between the calculated and the observed field data. Furthermore, the proposed method is an unsupervised approach, independent of any surface data, rather only the field data is used. Both TE field (Dirichlet boundary condition) and TM field (Neumann boundary condition) are considered. Two types of field data are used here: full scattered field data and phaseless total field data. The performance of the method is verified by testing with Gaussian-correlated random rough surfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the PINN-based method can recover rough surfaces with great accuracy and is robust with respect to a wide range of problem regimes.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Free Determination of Microstructure Representative Volume Element Size via Fisher Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A representative volume element (RVE) is a reasonably small unit of microstructure that can be simulated to obtain the same effective properties as the entire microstructure sample. Finite element (FE) simulation of RVEs, as opposed to much larger samples, saves computational expense, especially in multiscale modeling. Therefore, it is desirable to have a framework that determines RVE size prior to FE simulations. Existing methods select the RVE size based on when the FE-simulated properties of samples of increasing size converge with insignificant statistical variations, with the drawback that many samples must be simulated. We propose a simulation-free alternative that determines RVE size based only on a micrograph. The approach utilizes a machine learning model trained to implicitly characterize the stochastic nature of the input micrograph. The underlying rationale is to view RVE size as the smallest moving window size for which the stochastic nature of the microstructure within the window is stationary as the window moves across a large micrograph. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed Fisher score-based framework for microstructure nonstationarity monitoring. Because the resulting RVE size is based solely on the micrograph and does not involve any FE simulation of specific properties, it constitutes an RVE for any property of interest that solely depends on the microstructure characteristics. Through numerical experiments of simple and complex microstructures, we validate our approach and show that our selected RVE sizes are consistent with when the chosen FE-simulated properties converge.</description>

      <title>KATO: Knowledge Alignment and Transfer for Transistor Sizing of Different Design and Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic transistor sizing in circuit design continues to be a formidable challenge. Despite that Bayesian optimization (BO) has achieved significant success, it is circuit-specific, limiting the accumulation and transfer of design knowledge for broader applications. This paper proposes (1) efficient automatic kernel construction, (2) the first transfer learning across different circuits and technology nodes for BO, and (3) a selective transfer learning scheme to ensure only useful knowledge is utilized. These three novel components are integrated into BO with Multi-objective Acquisition Ensemble (MACE) to form Knowledge Alignment and Transfer Optimization (KATO) to deliver state-of-the-art performance: up to 2x simulation reduction and 1.2x design improvement over the baselines.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-designed algorithms have long been fundamental in solving a variety of scientific and engineering challenges. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A resource-efficient variational quantum algorithm for mRNA codon optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the mRNA codon has an essential impact on gene expression for a specific target protein. It is an NP-hard problem; thus, exact solutions to such optimization problems become computationally intractable for realistic problem sizes on both classical and quantum computers. However, approximate solutions via heuristics can substantially impact the application they enable. Quantum approximate optimization is an alternative computation paradigm promising for tackling such problems. Recently, there has been some research in quantum algorithms for bioinformatics, specifically for mRNA codon optimization. This research presents a denser way to encode codons for implementing mRNA codon optimization via the variational quantum eigensolver algorithms on a gate-based quantum computer. This reduces the qubit requirement by half compared to the existing quantum approach, thus allowing longer sequences to be executed on existing quantum processors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results to exact solutions, showing well-matching results.</description>

      <title>Saving proof-of-work by hierarchical block structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the current POW based consensus algorithm of the Bitcoin network suffers from a fundamental economic discrepancy between the real world transaction (txn) costs incurred by miners and the wealth that is being transacted. Put simply, whether one transacts 1 satoshi or 1 bitcoin, the same amount of electricity is needed when including this txn into a block. The notorious Bitcoin blockchain problems such as its high energy usage per txn or its scalability issues are, either partially or fully, mere consequences of this fundamental economic inconsistency. We propose making the computational cost of securing the txns proportional to the wealth being transferred, at least temporarily.
  First, we present a simple incentive based model of Bitcoin's security. Then, guided by this model, we augment each txn by two parameters, one controlling the time spent securing this txn and the second determining the fraction of the network used to accomplish this. The current Bitcoin txns are naturally embedded into this parametrized space. Then we introduce a sequence of hierarchical block structures (HBSs) containing these parametrized txns. The first of those HBSs exploits only a single degree of freedom of the extended txn, namely the time investment, but it allows already for txns with a variable level of trust together with aligned network fees and energy usage. In principle, the last HBS should scale to tens of thousands timely txns per second while preserving what the previous HBSs achieved.
  We also propose a simple homotopy based transition mechanism which enables us to relatively safely and continuously introduce new HBSs into the existing blockchain.
  Our approach is constructive and as rigorous as possible and we attempt to analyze all aspects of these developments, al least at a conceptual level. The process is supported by evaluation on recent transaction data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Portfolio Optimization with Transformer-GAN Integration: A Novel Approach in the Black-Litterman Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative approach to portfolio optimization by integrating Transformer models with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) within the Black-Litterman (BL) framework. Capitalizing on Transformers' ability to discern long-range dependencies and GANs' proficiency in generating accurate predictive models, our method enhances the generation of refined predictive views for BL portfolio allocations. This fusion of our model with BL's structured method for merging objective views with market equilibrium offers a potent tool for modern portfolio management, outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our integrated approach not only demonstrates the potential to improve investment decision-making but also contributes a new approach to capture the complexities of financial markets for robust portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Synergistic Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>
