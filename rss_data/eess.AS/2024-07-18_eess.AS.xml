      <title>ICAGC 2024: Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024 (ICAGC 2024) is part of the ISCSLP 2024 Competitions and Challenges track. While current text-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate high-quality audio, its ability to convey complex emotions and controlled detail content remains limited. This constraint leads to a discrepancy between the generated audio and human subjective perception in practical applications like companion robots for children and marketing bots. The core issue lies in the inconsistency between high-quality audio generation and the ultimate human subjective experience. Therefore, this challenge aims to enhance the persuasiveness and acceptability of synthesized audio, focusing on human alignment convincing and inspirational audio generation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for the Internet of Sounds: Architecture, Design Principles, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Sounds (IoS) combines sound sensing, processing, and transmission techniques, enabling collaboration among diverse sound devices. To achieve perceptual quality of sound synchronization in the IoS, it is necessary to precisely synchronize three critical factors: sound quality, timing, and behavior control. However, conventional bit-oriented communication, which focuses on bit reproduction, may not be able to fulfill these synchronization requirements under dynamic channel conditions. One promising approach to address the synchronization challenges of the IoS is through the use of semantic communication (SC) that can capture and leverage the logical relationships in its source data. Consequently, in this paper, we propose an IoS-centric SC framework with a transceiver design. The designed encoder extracts semantic information from diverse sources and transmits it to IoS listeners. It can also distill important semantic information to reduce transmission latency for timing synchronization. At the receiver's end, the decoder employs context- and knowledge-based reasoning techniques to reconstruct and integrate sounds, which achieves sound quality synchronization across diverse communication environments. Moreover, by periodically sharing knowledge, SC models of IoS devices can be updated to optimize their synchronization behavior. Finally, we explore several open issues on mathematical models, resource allocation, and cross-layer protocols.</description>

      <title>Laugh Now Cry Later: Controlling Time-Varying Emotional States of Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People change their tones of voice, often accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter and cries, to convey rich emotions. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the capability to generate speech with rich emotions, including NVs. This paper introduces EmoCtrl-TTS, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS that can generate highly emotional speech with NVs for any speaker. EmoCtrl-TTS leverages arousal and valence values, as well as laughter embeddings, to condition the flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. To achieve high-quality emotional speech generation, EmoCtrl-TTS is trained using more than 27,000 hours of expressive data curated based on pseudo-labeling. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that EmoCtrl-TTS excels in mimicking the emotions of audio prompts in speech-to-speech translation scenarios. We also show that EmoCtrl-TTS can capture emotion changes, express strong emotions, and generate various NVs in zero-shot TTS. See https://aka.ms/emoctrl-tts for demo samples.</description>

      <title>PCQ: Emotion Recognition in Speech via Progressive Channel Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-computer interaction (HCI), Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key technology for understanding human intentions and emotions. Traditional SER methods struggle to effectively capture the long-term temporal correla-tions and dynamic variations in complex emotional expressions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the PCQ method, a pioneering approach for SER via \textbf{P}rogressive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{Q}uerying. This method can drill down layer by layer in the channel dimension through the channel query technique to achieve dynamic modeling of long-term contextual information of emotions. This mul-ti-level analysis gives the PCQ method an edge in capturing the nuances of hu-man emotions. Experimental results show that our model improves the weighted average (WA) accuracy by 3.98\% and 3.45\% and the unweighted av-erage (UA) accuracy by 5.67\% and 5.83\% on the IEMOCAP and EMODB emotion recognition datasets, respectively, significantly exceeding the baseline levels.</description>

      <title>BSC-UPC at EmoSPeech-IberLEF2024: Attention Pooling for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domain of speech emotion recognition (SER) has persistently been a frontier within the landscape of machine learning. It is an active field that has been revolutionized in the last few decades and whose implementations are remarkable in multiple applications that could affect daily life. Consequently, the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF) of 2024 held a competitive challenge to leverage the SER results with a Spanish corpus. This paper presents the approach followed with the goal of participating in this competition. The main architecture consists of different pre-trained speech and text models to extract features from both modalities, utilizing an attention pooling mechanism. The proposed system has achieved the first position in the challenge with an 86.69% in Macro F1-Score.</description>

      <title>TTSDS -- Text-to-Speech Distribution Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recently published Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems produce audio close to real speech. However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the results obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We propose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple factors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach assesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates of each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and noise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and show that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly correlates with the human evaluations from each time period.</description>

      <title>TalTech-IRIT-LIS Speaker and Language Diarization Systems for DISPLACE 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the submissions of team TalTech-IRIT-LIS to the DISPLACE 2024 challenge. Our team participated in the speaker diarization and language diarization tracks of the challenge. In the speaker diarization track, our best submission was an ensemble of systems based on the pyannote.audio speaker diarization pipeline utilizing powerset training and our recently proposed PixIT method that performs joint diarization and speech separation. We improve upon PixIT by using the separation outputs for speaker embedding extraction. Our ensemble achieved a diarization error rate of 27.1% on the evaluation dataset. In the language diarization track, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Wav2Vec2-BERT language embedding model on in-domain data, and clustered short segments using AHC and VBx, based on similarity scores from LDA/PLDA. This led to a language diarization error rate of 27.6% on the evaluation data. Both results were ranked first in their respective challenge tracks.</description>

      <title>Flowers Revisited: A Preliminary Replication of Flowers et al. 1997</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1997, Flowers, Buhman, and Turnage published a paper titled ``Cross-Modal Equivalence of Visual and Auditory Scatterplots for Exploring Bivariate Data Samples.'' This paper examined our capacity to assess the relationship between two data variables when presented through visual or auditory scatterplots. Twenty-seven years later, we have replicated the first part of this influential study and present the preliminary findings of our replication, initially involving 21 participants. In addition to purely auditory and visual scatterplots, we introduced audiovisual scatterplots as a third condition in our experiment. Our initial findings mirror those of Flowers et al.'s original research. With this extended abstract, we also aim to spark a discussion about the significance of replication studies for our research community in general.</description>

      <title>The Kolmogorov Complexity of Irish traditional dance music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the Kolmogorov complexity of melodies in Irish traditional dance music using Lempel-Ziv compression. The "tunes" of the music are presented in so-called "ABC notation" as simply a sequence of letters from an alphabet: We have no rhythmic variation, with all notes being of equal length. Our estimation of algorithmic complexity can be used to distinguish "simple" or "easy" tunes (with more repetition) from "difficult" ones (with less repetition) which should prove useful for students learning tunes. We further present a comparison of two tune categories (reels and jigs) in terms of their complexity.</description>

      <title>A Language Modeling Approach to Diacritic-Free Hebrew TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the task of text-to-speech (TTS) in Hebrew. Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech.

      <title>Audio Conditioning for Music Generation via Discrete Bottleneck Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While most music generation models use textual or parametric conditioning (e.g. tempo, harmony, musical genre), we propose to condition a language model based music generation system with audio input. Our exploration involves two distinct strategies. The first strategy, termed textual inversion, leverages a pre-trained text-to-music model to map audio input to corresponding "pseudowords" in the textual embedding space. For the second model we train a music language model from scratch jointly with a text conditioner and a quantized audio feature extractor. At inference time, we can mix textual and audio conditioning and balance them thanks to a novel double classifier free guidance method. We conduct automatic and human studies that validates our approach. We will release the code and we provide music samples on https://musicgenstyle.github.io in order to show the quality of our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained traction in symbolic music tasks, yet a lack of a unified framework impedes progress. Addressing this gap, we present GraphMuse, a graph processing framework and library that facilitates efficient music graph processing and GNN training for symbolic music tasks. Central to our contribution is a new neighbor sampling technique specifically targeted toward meaningful behavior in musical scores. Additionally, GraphMuse integrates hierarchical modeling elements that augment the expressivity and capabilities of graph networks for musical tasks. Experiments with two specific musical prediction tasks -- pitch spelling and cadence detection -- demonstrate significant performance improvement over previous methods. Our hope is that GraphMuse will lead to a boost in, and standardization of, symbolic music processing based on graph representations. The library is available at https://github.com/manoskary/graphmuse</description>

Abstract: Vibravox is a dataset compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) containing audio recordings using five different body-conduction audio sensors : two in-ear microphones, two bone conduction vibration pickups and a laryngophone. The data set also includes audio data from an airborne microphone used as a reference. The Vibravox corpus contains 38 hours of speech samples and physiological sounds recorded by 188 participants under different acoustic conditions imposed by an high order ambisonics 3D spatializer. Annotations about the recording conditions and linguistic transcriptions are also included in the corpus. We conducted a series of experiments on various speech-related tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement and speaker verification. These experiments were carried out using state-of-the-art models to evaluate and compare their performances on signals captured by the different audio sensors offered by the Vibravox dataset, with the aim of gaining a better grasp of their individual characteristics.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06259v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to extract the sounding object from a video frame, which is represented by a pixel-wise segmentation mask for application scenarios such as multi-modal video editing, augmented reality, and intelligent robot systems. The pioneering work conducts this task through dense feature-level audio-visual interaction, which ignores the dimension gap between different modalities. More specifically, the audio clip could only provide a Global semantic label in each sequence, but the video frame covers multiple semantic objects across different Local regions, which leads to mislocalization of the representationally similar but semantically different object. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Network (C3N) to align the audio-visual semantics from the global dimension and progressively inject them into the local regions via an attention mechanism. Firstly, a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus Inference Module (C3IM) is developed to extract a unified-modal label by integrating audio/visual classification confidence and similarities of modality-agnostic label embeddings. Then, we feed the unified-modal label back to the visual backbone as the explicit semantic-level guidance via a Cognitive Consensus guided Attention Module (CCAM), which highlights the local features corresponding to the interested object. Extensive experiments on the Single Sound Source Segmentation (S4) setting and Multiple Sound Source Segmentation (MS3) setting of the AVSBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Towards Weakly Supervised Text-to-Audio Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio grounding (TAG) task aims to predict the onsets and offsets of sound events described by natural language. This task can facilitate applications such as multimodal information retrieval. This paper focuses on weakly-supervised text-to-audio grounding (WSTAG), where frame-level annotations of sound events are unavailable, and only the caption of a whole audio clip can be utilized for training. WSTAG is superior to strongly-supervised approaches in its scalability to large audio-text datasets. Two WSTAG frameworks are studied in this paper: sentence-level and phrase-level. First, we analyze the limitations of mean pooling used in the previous WSTAG approach and investigate the effects of different pooling strategies. We then propose phrase-level WSTAG to use matching labels between audio clips and phrases for training. Advanced negative sampling strategies and self-supervision are proposed to enhance the accuracy of the weak labels and provide pseudo strong labels. Experimental results show that our system significantly outperforms the previous WSTAG SOTA. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of several factors on phrase-level WSTAG. The code and model is available at https://github.com/wsntxxn/TextToAudioGrounding.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{&lt;|endoftext|&gt;}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{&lt;|endoftext|&gt;}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</description>

      <title>PicoAudio: Enabling Precise Timestamp and Frequency Controllability of Audio Events in Text-to-audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, audio generation tasks have attracted considerable research interests. Precise temporal controllability is essential to integrate audio generation with real applications. In this work, we propose a temporal controlled audio generation framework, PicoAudio. PicoAudio integrates temporal information to guide audio generation through tailored model design. It leverages data crawling, segmentation, filtering, and simulation of fine-grained temporally-aligned audio-text data. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that PicoAudio dramantically surpasses current state-of-the-art generation models in terms of timestamp and occurrence frequency controllability. The generated samples are available on the demo website https://zeyuxie29.github.io/PicoAudio.github.io.</description>

      <title>GROOT: Generating Robust Watermark for Diffusion-Model-Based Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amid the burgeoning development of generative models like diffusion models, the task of differentiating synthesized audio from its natural counterpart grows more daunting. Deepfake detection offers a viable solution to combat this challenge. Yet, this defensive measure unintentionally fuels the continued refinement of generative models. Watermarking emerges as a proactive and sustainable tactic, preemptively regulating the creation and dissemination of synthesized content. Thus, this paper, as a pioneer, proposes the generative robust audio watermarking method (Groot), presenting a paradigm for proactively supervising the synthesized audio and its source diffusion models. In this paradigm, the processes of watermark generation and audio synthesis occur simultaneously, facilitated by parameter-fixed diffusion models equipped with a dedicated encoder. The watermark embedded within the audio can subsequently be retrieved by a lightweight decoder. The experimental results highlight Groot's outstanding performance, particularly in terms of robustness, surpassing that of the leading state-of-the-art methods. Beyond its impressive resilience against individual post-processing attacks, Groot exhibits exceptional robustness when facing compound attacks, maintaining an average watermark extraction accuracy of around 95%.</description>

      <title>Knowledge boosting during low-latency inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for low-latency, streaming applications could benefit from the knowledge capacity of larger models, but edge devices cannot run these models due to resource constraints. A possible solution is to transfer hints during inference from a large model running remotely to a small model running on-device. However, this incurs a communication delay that breaks real-time requirements and does not guarantee that both models will operate on the same data at the same time. We propose knowledge boosting, a novel technique that allows a large model to operate on time-delayed input during inference, while still boosting small model performance. Using a streaming neural network that processes 8 ms chunks, we evaluate different speech separation and enhancement tasks with communication delays of up to six chunks or 48 ms. Our results show larger gains where the performance gap between the small and large models is wide, demonstrating a promising method for large-small model collaboration for low-latency applications.

      <title>Statistics-aware Audio-visual Deepfake Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an enhanced audio-visual deep detection method. Recent methods in audio-visual deepfake detection mostly assess the synchronization between audio and visual features. Although they have shown promising results, they are based on the maximization/minimization of isolated feature distances without considering feature statistics. Moreover, they rely on cumbersome deep learning architectures and are heavily dependent on empirically fixed hyperparameters. Herein, to overcome these limitations, we propose: (1) a statistical feature loss to enhance the discrimination capability of the model, instead of relying solely on feature distances; (2) using the waveform for describing the audio as a replacement of frequency-based representations; (3) a post-processing normalization of the fakeness score; (4) the use of shallower network for reducing the computational complexity. Experiments on the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method.</description>
