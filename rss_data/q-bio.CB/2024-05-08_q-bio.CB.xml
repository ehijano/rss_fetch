      <title>Gradient sensing limit of a cell when controlling the elongating direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells perform chemotaxis by determining the direction of chemical gradients based on stochastic sensing of concentrations at the cell surface. To examine the efficiency of this process, previous studies have investigated the limit of estimation accuracy for gradients. However, these studies assume that the cell shape and gradient are constant, and do not consider how adaptive regulation of cell shape affects the estimation limit. Dynamics of cell shape during gradient sensing is biologically ubiquitous and can influence the estimation by altering the way the concentration is measured, and cells may strategically regulate their shape to improve estimation accuracy. To address this gap, we investigate the estimation limits in dynamic situations where cells change shape adaptively depending on the sensed signal. We approach this problem by analyzing the stationary solution of the Bayesian nonlinear filtering equation. By applying diffusion approximation to the ligand-receptor binding process and the Laplace method for the posterior expectation under a high signal-to-noise ratio regime, we obtain an analytical expression for the estimation limit. This expression indicates that estimation accuracy can be improved by elongating perpendicular to the estimated direction, which is also confirmed by numerical simulations. Our analysis provides a basis for clarifying the interplay between estimation and control in gradient sensing and sheds light on how cells optimize their shape to enhance chemotactic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Determining cell population size from cell fraction in cell plasticity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the size of cell populations is crucial for understanding biological processes such as growth, injury repair, and disease progression. Often, experimental data offer information in the form of relative frequencies of distinct cell types, rather than absolute cell counts. This emphasizes the need to devise effective strategies for estimating absolute cell quantities from fraction data. In response to this challenge, we present two computational approaches grounded in stochastic cell population models: the first-order moment method (FOM) and the second-order moment method (SOM). These methods explicitly establish mathematical mappings from cell fraction to cell population size using moment equations of the stochastic models. Notably, our investigation demonstrates that the SOM method obviates the requirement for a priori knowledge of the initial population size, highlighting the utility of incorporating variance details from cell proportions. The robustness of both the FOM and SOM methods was analyzed from different perspectives. Additionally, we extended the application of the FOM and SOM methods to various biological mechanisms within the context of cell plasticity models. Our methodologies not only assist in mitigating the inherent limitations of experimental techniques when only fraction data is available for detecting cell population size, but they also offer new insights into utilizing the stochastic characteristics of cell population dynamics to quantify interactions between different biomasses within the system.</description>

      <title>Clustering and spatial distribution of mitochondria in dendritic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal dendrites form densely branched tree architectures through which mitochondria must be distributed to supply the cell's energetic needs. Dendritic mitochondria circulate through the tree, undergoing fusion and fission to form clusters of varying sizes. We present a mathematical model for the distribution of such actively-driven particles in a branched geometry. Our model demonstrates that `balanced' trees (wherein cross-sectional area is conserved across junctions and thicker branches support more bushy subtrees) enable symmetric yet distally enriched particle distributions and promote dispersion into smaller clusters. These results highlight the importance of tree architecture and radius-dependent fusion in governing the distribution of neuronal mitochondria.</description>
