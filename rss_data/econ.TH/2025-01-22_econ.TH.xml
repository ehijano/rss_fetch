      <title>Efficient Segmentation of Search Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider a two-sided frictional search market where buyers search and match to vertically differentiated sellers. The market is segmented into submarkets based on seller types, with segmentation serving as a public signal that directs buyers' search. I characterize the socially efficient and equilibrium allocations of buyers across submarkets for any fixed segmentation, and identify a Hosios condition under which the equilibrium allocation is efficient. I further examine the design of surplus-maximizing segmentations, demonstrating the role of congestion externalities in determining whether the constrained-efficient segmentation fully reveals seller types or pools types into at most a binary partition. These results clarify the conditions under which the provision of public information is welfare enhancing in search markets with externalities.</description>

      <title>Global Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, State-Salient Decision Rules and the Strict Condorcet Choice Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple proof of a well-known axiomatic characterization of state-salient decision rules, using Weak Dominance Criterion and Global Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. Subsequently we provide a simple axiomatic characterization of the Strict-Condorcet choice function on the domain of all preference profiles that have a strict-Condorcet winner, assuming that if the first two ranks are occupied by the same two alternatives in all states of nature, then the chosen alternative will be the one from these two that is preferred to the other with probability greater than half-provided such an alternative exists. We also show that this result is not valid if we extend the domain to the set of all preference profiles that have a unique weak-Condorcet winner.</description>

      <title>Equilibria under Dynamic Benchmark Consistency in Non-Stationary Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and study a general time-varying multi-agent system where players repeatedly compete under incomplete information. Our work is motivated by scenarios commonly observed in online advertising and retail marketplaces, where agents and platform designers optimize algorithmic decision-making in dynamic competitive settings. In these systems, no-regret algorithms that provide guarantees relative to \emph{static} benchmarks can perform poorly and the distributions of play that emerge from their interaction do not correspond anymore to static solution concepts such as coarse correlated equilibria. Instead, we analyze the interaction of \textit{dynamic benchmark} consistent policies that have performance guarantees relative to \emph{dynamic} sequences of actions, and through a novel \textit{tracking error} notion we delineate when their empirical joint distribution of play can approximate an evolving sequence of static equilibria. In systems that change sufficiently slowly (sub-linearly in the horizon length), we show that the resulting distributions of play approximate the sequence of coarse correlated equilibria, and apply this result to establish improved welfare bounds for smooth games. On a similar vein, we formulate internal dynamic benchmark consistent policies and establish that they approximate sequences of correlated equilibria. Our findings therefore suggest that, in a broad range of multi-agent systems where non-stationarity is prevalent, algorithms designed to compete with dynamic benchmarks can improve both individual and welfare guarantees, and their emerging dynamics approximate a sequence of static equilibrium outcomes.</description>

      <title>Recursive Preferences, Correlation Aversion, and the Temporal Resolution of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel behavioral feature of recursive preferences: aversion to risks that persist over time, or simply correlation aversion. Greater persistence provides information about future consumption but reduces opportunities to hedge consumption risk. I show that, for recursive preferences, correlation aversion is equivalent to increasing relative risk aversion. To quantify correlation aversion, I develop the concept of the persistence premium, which measures how much an individual is willing to pay to eliminate persistence in consumption. I provide an approximation of the persistence premium in the spirit of Arrow-Pratt, which provides a quantitative representation of the trade-off between information and hedging. I present several applications. The persistence premium helps create more realistic calibrations for macro-finance models. In an optimal taxation model, I show that recursive preferences unlike standard preferences-lead to more progressive taxation when human capital persistence is greater. Finally, I show that correlation-averse preferences have a variational representation, linking correlation aversion to concerns about model misspecification.</description>
