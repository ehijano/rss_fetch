      <title>Converter: Enhancing Interoperability in Research Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research Data Management (RDM) is essential in handling and organizing data in the research field. The Berlin Open Science Platform (BOP) serves as a case study that exemplifies the significance of standardization within the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), employing different vocabularies when publishing their data, resulting in data heterogeneity. The meta portals of the NFDI4Cat and the NFDI4DataScience project serve as additional case studies in the context of the NFDI initiative. To establish consistency among the harvested repositories in the respective systems, this study focuses on developing a novel component, namely the converter, that breaks barriers between data collection and various schemas. With the minor modification of the existing Piveau framework, the development of the converter, contributes to enhanced data accessibility, streamlined collaboration, and improved interoperability within the research community.</description>

      <title>MatInf -- an Extensible Open-Source Solution for Research Digitalisation in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13722</link>

Abstract: Information technology and data science development stimulate transformation in many fields of scientific knowledge. In recent years, a large number of specialized systems for information and knowledge management have been created in materials science. However, the development and deployment of open adaptive systems for research support in materials science based on the acquisition, storage, and processing of different types of information remains unsolved. We propose MatInf - an extensible, open-source solution for research digitalisation in materials science based on an adaptive, flexible information management system for heterogeneous data sources. MatInf can be easily adapted to any materials science laboratory and is especially useful for collaborative projects between several labs. As an example, we demonstrate its application in high-throughput experimentation.</description>

      <title>$\Phi$ index: A standardized scale-independent citation indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00997</link>

Abstract: The sensitivity of Impact Factors (IFs) to journal size causes systematic bias in IF rankings, in a process akin to {\it stacking the cards}: A random ``journal'' of $n$ papers can attain a range of IF values that decreases rapidly with size, as $\sim 1/\sqrt{n}$ . The Central Limit Theorem, which underlies this effect, also allows us to correct it by standardizing citation averages for scale {\it and} subject in a geometrically intuitive manner analogous to calculating the $z$-score. We thus propose the $\Phi$ index, a standardized scale- and subject-independent citation average. The $\Phi$ index passes the ``random sample test'', a simple check for scale and subject independence that we argue ought to be used for every citation indicator. We present $\Phi$ index rankings for 12,173 journals using 2020 Journal Citation Reports data. We show how scale standardization alone affects rankings, demonstrate the additional effect of subject standardization for monodisciplinary journals, and discuss how to treat multidisciplinary journals. $\Phi$ index rankings offer a clear improvement over IF rankings. And because the $\Phi$ index methodology is general, it can also be applied to compare individual researchers, universities, or countries.</description>

      <title>Curious Rhythms: Temporal Regularities of Wikipedia Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia, in its role as the world's largest encyclopedia, serves a broad range of information needs. Although previous studies have noted that Wikipedia users' information needs vary throughout the day, there is to date no large-scale, quantitative study of the underlying dynamics. The present paper fills this gap by investigating temporal regularities in daily consumption patterns in a large-scale analysis of billions of timezone-corrected page requests mined from English Wikipedia's server logs, with the goal of investigating how context and time relate to the kind of information consumed. First, we show that even after removing the global pattern of day-night alternation, the consumption habits of individual articles maintain strong diurnal regularities. Then, we characterize the prototypical shapes of consumption patterns, finding a particularly strong distinction between articles preferred during the evening/night and articles preferred during working hours. Finally, we investigate topical and contextual correlates of Wikipedia articles' access rhythms, finding that article topic, reader country, and access device (mobile vs. desktop) are all important predictors of daily attention patterns. These findings shed new light on how humans seek information on the Web by focusing on Wikipedia as one of the largest open platforms for knowledge and learning, emphasizing Wikipedia's role as a rich knowledge base that fulfills information needs spread throughout the day, with implications for understanding information seeking across the globe and for designing appropriate information systems.</description>
