      <title>A PTAS for Travelling Salesman Problem with Neighbourhoods Over Parallel Line Segments of Similar Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Travelling Salesman Problem with Neighbourhoods (TSPN) on the Euclidean plane ($\RR^2$) and present a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) when the neighbourhoods are parallel line segments with lengths between $ [1, \lambda] $ for any constant value $ \lambda \ge 1 $.
  In TSPN (which generalizes classic TSP), each client represents a set (or neighbourhood) of points in a metric
  and the goal is to find a minimum cost TSP tour that visits
  at least one point from each client set. In the Euclidean setting, each neighbourhood is a region on the plane.
  TSPN is significantly more difficult than classic TSP even in the Euclidean setting, as it captures group TSP.
  A notable case of TSPN is when each neighbourhood is a line segment. Although there are PTASs for when
  neighbourhoods are fat objects (with limited overlap), TSPN over line segments is \textbf{APX}-hard even if all
  the line segments have unit length. For parallel (unit) line segments, the best approximation factor is $3\sqrt2$ from more than two decades ago \cite{DM03}.
  The PTAS we present in this paper settles the approximability of this case of the problem. Our algorithm finds a $ (1 + \eps) $-factor approximation for an instance of the problem for $n$ segments with lengths in $ [1,\lambda] $ in time $ n^{O(\lambda/\eps^3)} $.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Hyper-triangles on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, which use hyperedges to capture groupwise interactions among different entities, have gained increasing attention recently for their versatility in effectively modeling real-world networks. In this paper, we study the problem of computing hyper-triangles (formed by three fully-connected hyperedges), which is a basic structural unit in hypergraphs. Although existing approaches can be adopted to compute hyper-triangles by exhaustively examining hyperedge combinations, they overlook the structural characteristics distinguishing different hyper-triangle patterns. Consequently, these approaches lack specificity in computing particular hyper-triangle patterns and exhibit low efficiency. In this paper, we unveil a new formation pathway for hyper-triangles, transitioning from hyperedges to hyperwedges before assembling into hyper-triangles, and classify hyper-triangle patterns based on hyperwedges. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a two-step framework to reduce the redundant checking of hyperedge combinations. Under this framework, we propose efficient algorithms for computing a specific pattern of hyper-triangles. Approximate algorithms are also devised to support estimated counting scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained hypergraph clustering coefficient measurement that can reflect diverse properties of hypergraphs based on different hyper-triangle patterns. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on 11 real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Problems with a Distributive Lattice Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the polynomial-time solvability of $k$-\textsc{Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts} (De Berg et al., ISAAC'23) to a wider class of combinatorial problems whose solution sets have a distributive lattice structure. We identify three structural conditions that, when met by a problem, ensure that a $k$-sized multiset of maximally-diverse solutions -- measured by the sum of pairwise Hamming distances -- can be found in polynomial time. We apply this framework to obtain polynomial time algorithms for finding diverse minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and diverse stable matchings. Moreover, we show that the framework extends to two other natural measures of diversity. Lastly, we present a simpler algorithmic framework for finding a largest set of pairwise disjoint solutions in problems that meet these structural conditions.</description>

      <title>Edge-weighted balanced connected partitions: Hardness and formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balanced connected $k$-partition problem (BCP) is a classic problem which consists in partitioning the set of vertices of a vertex-weighted connected graph into a collection of $k$ sets such that each of them induces a connected subgraph of roughly the same weight. There exists a vast literature on BCP that includes hardness results, approximation algorithms, integer programming formulations, and a polyhedral study. We investigate edge-weighted variants of BCP where we are given a connected graph $G$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}_\ge$, and an edge-weight function $w \colon E(G)\to\mathbb{Q}_\ge$, and the goal is to compute a spanning $k$-forest $\mathcal{T}$ of $G$ (i.e., a forest with exactly $k$ trees) that minimizes the weight of the heaviest tree in $\mathcal{T}$ in the min-max version, or maximizes the weight of the lightest tree in $\mathcal{T}$ in the max-min version. We show that both versions of this problem are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard on complete graphs with $k=2$, unweighted split graphs, and unweighted bipartite graphs with $k\geq 2$ fixed. Moreover, we prove that these problems do not admit subexponential-time algorithms, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. Finally, we devise compact and non-compact integer linear programming formulations, valid inequalities, and separation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Computing High-dimensional Confidence Sets for Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a high-density region of an arbitrary distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a confidence set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim D} \left[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central problem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence sets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.
  In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with bounded VC-dimension. An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with the smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\delta$. This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of all Euclidean balls. Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial time a ball whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive with the volume of the best ball.
  Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the desired coverage. The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid). Combined with our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of confidence sets.</description>

      <title>Faster Mixing of the Jerrum-Sinclair Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Jerrum-Sinclair Markov chain on matchings mixes in time $\widetilde{O}(\Delta^2 m)$ on any graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and maximum degree $\Delta$, for any constant edge weight $\lambda&gt;0$. For general graphs with arbitrary, potentially unbounded $\Delta$, this provides the first improvement over the classic $\widetilde{O}(n^2 m)$ mixing time bound of Jerrum and Sinclair (1989) and Sinclair (1992).
  To achieve this, we develop a general framework for analyzing mixing times, combining ideas from the classic canonical path method with the "local-to-global" approaches recently developed in high-dimensional expanders, introducing key innovations to both techniques.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Treewidth in Logarithmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic data structure that maintains a tree decomposition of width at most $9k+8$ of a dynamic graph with treewidth at most $k$, which is updated by edge insertions and deletions. The amortized update time of our data structure is $2^{O(k)} \log n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. The data structure also supports maintaining any ``dynamic programming scheme'' on the tree decomposition, providing, for example, a dynamic version of Courcelle's theorem with $O_{k}(\log n)$ amortized update time; the $O_{k}(\cdot)$ notation hides factors that depend on $k$. This improves upon a result of Korhonen, Majewski, Nadara, Pilipczuk, and Soko{\l}owski [FOCS 2023], who gave a similar data structure but with amortized update time $2^{k^{O(1)}} n^{o(1)}$. Furthermore, our data structure is arguably simpler.
  Our main novel idea is to maintain a tree decomposition that is ``downwards well-linked'', which allows us to implement local rotations and analysis similar to those for splay trees.</description>

      <title>FB$^+$-tree: A Memory-Optimized B$^+$-tree with Latch-Free Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B$^+$-trees are prevalent in traditional database systems due to their versatility and balanced structure. While binary search is typically utilized for branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in main-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch operations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce fewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in range scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new high-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree (FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries, FB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix on each level of its inner nodes\textemdash referred to as features, which allows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines between B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case, FB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to function as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that combines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support efficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle atomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate latch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive experiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that FB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based indexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\ \sim\ $3.7x under 96 threads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads, especially update workloads under contention and scan workloads.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric graph alignment and the phase transition for asymmetric tree correlation testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph alignment - identifying node correspondences between two graphs - is a fundamental problem with applications in network analysis, biology, and privacy research. While substantial progress has been made in aligning correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs under symmetric settings, real-world networks often exhibit asymmetry in both node numbers and edge densities. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for asymmetric correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, generalizing existing models to account for these asymmetries. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of graph alignment in the sparse regime, where local neighborhoods exhibit tree-like structures. Our approach leverages tree correlation testing as the central tool in our polynomial-time algorithm, MPAlign, which achieves one-sided partial alignment under certain conditions.
  A key contribution of our work is characterizing these conditions under which asymmetric tree correlation testing is feasible: If two correlated graphs $G$ and $G'$ have average degrees $\lambda s$ and $\lambda s'$ respectively, where $\lambda$ is their common density and $s,s'$ are marginal correlation parameters, their tree neighborhoods can be aligned if $ss' &gt; \alpha$, where $\alpha$ denotes Otter's constant and $\lambda$ is supposed large enough. The feasibility of this tree comparison problem undergoes a sharp phase transition since $ss' \leq \alpha$ implies its impossibility. These new results on tree correlation testing allow us to solve a class of random subgraph isomorphism problems, resolving an open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>On the twin-width of near-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter based on the repeated contraction of near-twins. It has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and structural graph theory, as well as in finite model theory -- particularly since first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable when a witness certifying small twin-width is provided. However, the behavior of twin-width in specific graph classes, particularly cubic graphs, remains poorly understood. While cubic graphs are known to have unbounded twin-width, no explicit cubic graph of twin-width greater than 4 is known.
  This paper explores this phenomenon in regular and near-regular graph classes. We show that extremal graphs of bounded degree and high twin-width are asymmetric, partly explaining their elusiveness. Additionally, we establish bounds for circulant and d-degenerate graphs, and examine strongly regular graphs, which exhibit similar behavior to cubic graphs. Our results include determining the twin-width of Johnson graphs over 2-sets, and cyclic Latin square graphs.</description>

      <title>Interval Graphs are Reconstructible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is reconstructible if it is determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its proper induced subgraphs. The reconstruction conjecture postulates that every graph of order at least 3 is reconstructible. We show that interval graphs with at least three vertices are reconstructible. For this purpose we develop a technique to handle separations in the context of reconstruction. This resolves a major roadblock to using graph structure theory in the context of reconstruction. To apply our novel technique, we also develop a resilient combinatorial structure theory for interval graphs. A consequence of our result is that interval graphs can be reconstructed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum singular value transformation without block encodings: Near-optimal complexity with minimal ancilla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework underlying a wide range of quantum algorithms. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring $O(\log L)$ ancilla overhead and circuit depth $\widetilde{O}(d\lambda L)$ for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{k=1}^L \lambda_k H_k$, where $d$ is polynomial degree, and $\lambda=\sum_k |\lambda_k|$. We introduce a new approach that eliminates block encoding, needs only a single ancilla qubit, and maintains near-optimal complexity, using only basic Hamiltonian simulation methods such as Trotterization. Our method achieves a circuit depth of $\widetilde{O}(L(d\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}})^{1+o(1)})$, without any multi-qubit controlled gates. Here, $\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}}$ depends on the nested commutators of the $H_k$'s and can be much smaller than $\lambda$. Central to our technique is a novel use of Richardson extrapolation, enabling systematic error cancellation in interleaved sequences of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, establishing a broadly applicable framework beyond QSVT. Additionally, we propose two randomized QSVT algorithms for cases with only sampling access to Hamiltonian terms. The first uses qDRIFT, while the second replaces block encodings in QSVT with randomly sampled unitaries. Both achieve quadratic complexity in $d$, which we establish as a lower bound for any randomized method implementing polynomial transformations in this model. Finally, as applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for quantum linear systems and ground state property estimation, achieving near-optimal complexity without oracular access. Our results provide a new framework for quantum algorithms, reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We prove new hardness results for fundamental lattice problems under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Building on a recent breakthrough by Bitansky et al. [BHIRW24], who gave a polynomial-time reduction from $\mathsf{3SAT}$ to the (gap) $\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ problem-a class of CSPs with linear equations over finite fields-we derive ETH-hardness for several lattice problems.
  First, we show that for any $p \in [1, \infty)$, there exists an explicit constant $\gamma &gt; 1$ such that $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$ (the $\ell_p$-norm approximate Closest Vector Problem) does not admit a $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm unless ETH is false. Our reduction is deterministic and proceeds via a direct reduction from (gap) $\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ to $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$.
  Next, we prove a randomized ETH-hardness result for $\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\gamma}$ (the $\ell_p$-norm approximate Shortest Vector Problem) for all $p &gt; 2$. This result relies on a novel property of the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ in the $\ell_p$ norm and a randomized reduction from $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\gamma'}$.
  Finally, we improve over prior reductions from $\mathsf{3SAT}$ to $\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ (the Bounded Distance Decoding problem), yielding better ETH-hardness results for $\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ for any $p \in [1, \infty)$ and $\alpha &gt; \alpha_p^{\ddagger}$, where $\alpha_p^{\ddagger}$ is an explicit threshold depending on $p$.
  We additionally observe that prior work implies ETH hardness for the gap minimum distance problem ($\gamma$-$\mathsf{MDP}$) in codes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Cardinality Estimation and Conjunctive Query Evaluation With Simple Degree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation and conjunctive query evaluation are two of the most fundamental problems in database query processing. Recent work proposed, studied, and implemented a robust and practical information-theoretic cardinality estimation framework. In this framework, the estimator is the cardinality upper bound of a conjunctive query subject to ``degree-constraints'', which model a rich set of input data statistics. For general degree constraints, computing this bound is computationally hard. Researchers have naturally sought efficiently computable relaxed upper bounds that are as tight as possible. The polymatroid bound is the tightest among those relaxed upper bounds. While it is an open question whether the polymatroid bound can be computed in polynomial-time in general, it is known to be computable in polynomial-time for some classes of degree constraints.
  Our focus is on a common class of degree constraints called simple degree constraints. Researchers had not previously determined how to compute the polymatroid bound in polynomial time for this class of constraints. Our first main result is a polynomial time algorithm to compute the polymatroid bound given simple degree constraints. Our second main result is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a ``proof sequence'' establishing this bound. This proof sequence can then be incorporated in the PANDA-framework to give a faster algorithm to evaluate a conjunctive query. In addition, we show computational limitations to extending our results to broader classes of degree constraints. Finally, our technique leads naturally to a new relaxed upper bound called the {\em flow bound}, which is computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Beating full state tomography for unentangled spectrum estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ are needed to learn its spectrum? To date, the best known algorithms for spectrum estimation require as many copies as full state tomography, suggesting the possibility that learning a state's spectrum might be as difficult as learning the entire state. We show that this is not the case in the setting of unentangled measurements, by giving a spectrum estimation algorithm that uses $n = O(d^3\cdot (\log\log(d) / \log(d))^4 )$ copies of $\rho$, which is asymptotically fewer than the $n = \Omega(d^3)$ copies necessary for full state tomography. Our algorithm is inspired by the technique of local moment matching from classical statistics, and shows how it can be applied in the quantum setting.
  As an important subroutine in our spectrum estimation algorithm, we give an estimator of the $k$-th moment $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^k)$ which performs unentangled measurements and uses $O(d^{3-2/k})$ copies of $\rho$ in order to achieve a constant multiplicative error. This directly translates to an additive-error estimator of quantum Renyi entropy of order $k$ with the same number of copies.
  Finally, we present numerical evidence that the sample complexity of spectrum estimation can only improve over full state tomography by a sub-polynomial factor. Specifically, for spectrum learning with fully entangled measurements, we run simulations which suggest a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{2 - \gamma})$ copies for any constant $\gamma &gt; 0$. From this, we conclude the current best lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is likely not tight.</description>

      <title>Ridge Leverage Score Sampling for $\ell_p$ Subspace Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\ell_p$ subspace approximation problem is an NP-hard low rank approximation problem that generalizes the median hyperplane ($p = 1$), principal component analysis ($p = 2$), and center hyperplane problems ($p = \infty$). A popular approach to cope with the NP-hardness is to compute a strong coreset, which is a weighted subset of input points that simultaneously approximates the cost of every $k$-dimensional subspace, typically to $(1+\epsilon)$ relative error for a small constant $\epsilon$.
  We obtain an algorithm for constructing a strong coreset for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation of size $\tilde O(k\epsilon^{-4/p})$ for $p&lt;2$ and $\tilde O(k^{p/2}\epsilon^{-p})$ for $p&gt;2$. This offers the following improvements over prior work:
  - We construct the first strong coresets with nearly optimal dependence on $k$ for all $p\neq 2$. In prior work, [SW18] constructed coresets of modified points with a similar dependence on $k$, while [HV20] constructed true coresets with polynomially worse dependence on $k$. - We recover or improve the best known $\epsilon$ dependence for all $p$. In particular, for $p &gt; 2$, the [SW18] coreset of modified points had a dependence of $\epsilon^{-p^2/2}$ and the [HV20] coreset had a dependence of $\epsilon^{-3p}$.
  Our algorithm is based on sampling by root ridge leverage scores, which admits fast algorithms, especially for sparse or structured matrices. Our analysis avoids the use of the representative subspace theorem [SW18], which is a critical component of all prior dimension-independent coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation.
  Our techniques also lead to the first nearly optimal online strong coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with similar bounds as the offline setting, resolving a problem of [WY23]. All prior approaches lose $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in this setting, even when allowed to modify the original points.</description>

      <title>Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cuckoo Heavy Keeper and the balancing act of maintaining heavy-hitters in stream processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding heavy hitters in databases and data streams is a fundamental problem with applications ranging from network monitoring to database query optimization, machine learning, and more. Approximation algorithms offer practical solutions, but they present trade-offs involving throughput, memory usage, and accuracy. Moreover, modern applications further complicate these trade-offs by demanding capabilities beyond sequential processing - requiring both parallel performance scaling and support for concurrent queries/updates.
  Analysis of these trade-offs led us to the key idea behind our proposed streaming algorithm, Cuckoo Heavy Keeper (CHK). The approach introduces an inverted process for distinguishing frequent from infrequent items, which unlocks new algorithmic synergies that were previously inaccessible with conventional approaches. By further analyzing the competing metrics with a focus on parallelism, we propose an algorithmic framework that balances scalability aspects and provides options to optimize query and insertion efficiency based on their relative frequencies. The framework is suitable for parallelizing any sequential heavy-hitter algorithm.
  Besides the algorithms' analysis, we present an extensive evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data across diverse distributions and query selectivity, representing the broad spectrum of application needs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CHK improves throughput by 1.7-5.7X and accuracy by up to four orders of magnitude even under low-skew data and tight memory constraints. These properties allow its parallel instances to achieve near-linear scale-up and low latency for heavy-hitter queries, even under a high query rate. We expect the versatility of CHK and its parallel instances to impact a broad spectrum of tools and applications in large-scale data analytics and stream processing systems.</description>

      <title>Cutwidth Bounds via Vertex Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cutwidth measure on graphs and ways to bound the cutwidth of a graph by partitioning its vertices. We consider bounds expressed as a function of two quantities: on the one hand, the maximal cutwidth y of the subgraphs induced by the classes of the partition, and on the other hand, the cutwidth x of the quotient multigraph obtained by merging each class to a single vertex. We consider in particular the decomposition of directed graphs into strongly connected components (SCCs): in this case, y is the maximal cutwidth of an SCC, and x is the cutwidth of the directed acyclic condensation multigraph.
  We show that the cutwidth of a graph is always in O(x + y), specifically it can be upper bounded by 1.5x + y. We also show a lower bound justifying that the constant 1.5 cannot be improved in general</description>
