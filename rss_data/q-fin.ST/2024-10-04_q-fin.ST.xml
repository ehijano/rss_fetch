      <title>Value of Information in the Mean-Square Case and its Application to the Analysis of Financial Time-Series Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances and development of various machine learning techniques has lead to practical solutions in various areas of science, engineering, medicine and finance. The great choice of algorithms, their implementations and libraries has resulted in another challenge of selecting the right algorithm and tuning their parameters in order to achieve optimal or satisfactory performance in specific applications. Here we show how the value of information (V(I)) can be used in this task to guide the algorithm choice and parameter tuning process. After estimating the amount of Shannon's mutual information between the predictor and response variables, V(I) can define theoretical upper bound of performance of any algorithm. The inverse function I(V) defines the lower frontier of the minimum amount of information required to achieve the desired performance. In this paper, we illustrate the value of information for the mean-square error minimization and apply it to forecasts of cryptocurrency log-returns.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Time Series Forecasting: A Comparative Study of Adam and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient on LSTM and GRU networks Using Stock Market data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies have discussed the impact different optimization techniques in the context of time series forecasting across different Neural network architectures. This paper examines the effectiveness of Adam and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) optimization techniques on LSTM and GRU neural networks for time series prediction, specifically stock market time-series. Our study was done by training LSTM and GRU models with two different optimization techniques - Adam and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), comparing and evaluating their performance on Apple Inc's closing price data over the last decade. The GRU model optimized with Adam produced the lowest RMSE, outperforming the other model-optimizer combinations in both accuracy and convergence speed. The GRU models with both optimizers outperformed the LSTM models, whilst the Adam optimizer outperformed the NAG optimizer for both model architectures. The results suggest that GRU models optimized with Adam are well-suited for practitioners in time-series prediction, more specifically stock price time series prediction producing accurate and computationally efficient models. The code for the experiments in this project can be found at https://github.com/AhmadMak/Time-Series-Optimization-Research Keywords: Time-series Forecasting, Neural Network, LSTM, GRU, Adam Optimizer, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) Optimizer</description>

      <title>Explaining Indian Stock Market through Geometry of Scale free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we model the Indian stock market as heterogenous scale free network, which is then embedded in a two dimensional hyperbolic space through a machine learning based technique called as coalescent embedding. This allows us to apply the hyperbolic kmeans algorithm on the Poincare disc and the clusters so obtained resemble the original network communities more closely than the clusters obtained via Euclidean kmeans on the basis of well-known measures normalised mutual information and adjusted mutual information. Through this, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility by applying non-parametric statistical tests with a significance level of 0.05 to geometric measures namely hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance. After that, we are able to spot significant market change early by leveraging the Bollinger Band analysis on the time series of modularity in the embedded networks of each window. Finally, the radial distance and the Equidistance Angular coordinates help in visualizing the embedded network in the Poincare disc and it is seen that specific market sectors cluster together.</description>
