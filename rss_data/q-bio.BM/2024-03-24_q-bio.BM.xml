      <title>Selective advantage of aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utilization of glycolysis in aerobic conditions have been a subject of debate for more than a century. A hypothesis supported by previous data is that glycolysis has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass and per occupied volume than oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). However, a recent work by Shen et al14 challenges previous estimates, reporting that OxPhos has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass than glycolysis. Here I show that Shen et al14 make a key assumption that is a subject of debate: that the proteomic cost of OxPhos is limited to proteins in enzymes of OxPhos and the TCA cycle. I argue that an intact mitochondria is required for functional OxPhos and therefore the whole mitochondrial protein content should be included for the cost estimate of OxPhos. After doing so, glycolysis is the most efficient pathway per protein mass or per volume fraction.</description>

      <title>Universal Cold RNA Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA's diversity of structures and functions impacts all life forms since primordia. We use calorimetric force spectroscopy to investigate RNA folding landscapes in previously unexplored low-temperature conditions. We find that Watson-Crick RNA hairpins, the most basic secondary structure elements, undergo a glass-like transition below $\mathbf{T_G\sim 20 ^{\circ}}$C where the heat capacity abruptly changes and the RNA folds into a diversity of misfolded structures. We hypothesize that an altered RNA biochemistry, determined by sequence-independent ribose-water interactions, outweighs sequence-dependent base pairing. The ubiquitous ribose-water interactions lead to universal RNA phase transitions below $\mathbf{T_G}$, such as maximum stability at $\mathbf{T_S\sim 5 ^{\circ}}$C where water density is maximum, and cold denaturation at $\mathbf{T_C\sim-50^{\circ}}$C. RNA cold biochemistry may have a profound impact on RNA function and evolution.</description>

      <title>Competition for binding targets results in paradoxical effects for simultaneous activator and repressor action -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of epigenetic transformations in cancer metastasis, a puzzling effect was recently discovered, in which the elimination (knock-out) of an activating regulatory element leads to increased (rather than decreased) activity of the element being regulated. It has been postulated that this paradoxical behavior can be explained by activating and repressing transcription factors competing for binding to other possible targets. It is very difficult to prove this hypothesis in mammalian cells, due to the large number of potential players and the complexity of endogenous intracellular regulatory networks. Instead, this paper analyzes this issue through an analogous synthetic biology construct which aims to reproduce the paradoxical behavior using standard bacterial gene expression networks. The paper first reviews the motivating cancer biology work, and then describes a proposed synthetic construct. A mathematical model is formulated, and basic properties of uniqueness of steady states and convergence to equilibria are established, as well as an identification of parameter regimes which should lead to observing such paradoxical phenomena (more activator leads to less activity at steady state). A proof is also given to show that this is a steady-state property, and for initial transients the phenomenon will not be observed. This work adds to the general line of work of resource competition in synthetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Lipidomic Automation Workflow using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15076</link>

Abstract: Lipidomics generates large data that makes manual annotation and interpretation challenging. Lipid chemical and structural diversity with structural isomers further complicates annotation. Although, several commercial and open-source software for targeted lipid identification exists, it lacks automated method generation workflows and integration with statistical and bioinformatics tools. We have developed the Comprehensive Lipidomic Automated Workflow (CLAW) platform with integrated workflow for parsing, detailed statistical analysis and lipid annotations based on custom multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) precursor and product ion pair transitions. CLAW contains several modules including identification of carbon-carbon double bond position(s) in unsaturated lipids when combined with ozone electrospray ionization (OzESI)-MRM methodology. To demonstrate the utility of the automated workflow in CLAW, large-scale lipidomics data was collected with traditional and OzESI-MRM profiling on biological and non-biological samples. Specifically, a total of 1497 transitions organized into 10 MRM-based mass spectrometry methods were used to profile lipid droplets isolated from different brain regions of 18-24 month-old Alzheimer's disease mice and age-matched wild-type controls. Additionally, triacyclglycerols (TGs) profiles with carbon-carbon double bond specificity were generated from canola oil samples using OzESI-MRM profiling. We also developed an integrated language user interface with large language models using artificially intelligent (AI) agents that permits users to interact with the CLAW platform using a chatbot terminal to perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses. We envision CLAW pipeline to be used in high-throughput lipid structural identification tasks aiding users to generate automated lipidomics workflows ranging from data acquisition to AI agent-based bioinformatic analysis.</description>
