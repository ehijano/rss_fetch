      <title>Symmetry shifting for monoidal bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every braiding on a monoidal bicategory induces a monoidal structure on its bicategory of monoids, such that if the former is sylleptic or symmetric then the latter is braided or symmetric, respectively. This extends a classic theorem of Joyal and Street for monoidal categories. The proof presented in this paper is an application of the $\infty$-operadic Additivity Theorem and thereby averts any considerable calculations.</description>

      <title>Relative and lax volutive categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a relative volutive (higher) category, specializing to the notion of a lax volutive (higher) category. Our primary motivation to study these objects is the following: while any rigid symmetric monoidal category admits a volutive structure, any closed symmetric monoidal category admits a lax volutive structure. We develop some of the basic theory of relative volutive categories and provide several equivalent formulations of lax volutive categories. We then study examples of interest, including categories of complete bornological vector spaces and modules over star-rings. We will also separately discuss unbounded operators between Hilbert spaces and Morita 2-categories, the latter of which in the context of fully closed symmetric monoidal 2-categories.</description>

      <title>The dimension of the tangent bundle and the universality of the vertical lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a new perspective on the universality of the vertical lift in tangent categories by presenting a categorification of the dimension of smooth manifolds. The universality of the vertical lift is a key part of the axioms of a tangent category as presented in [4]. The categorical dimension presented in this paper provides insight into the nature of this property. The main result is Theorem 3.7, showing that if it exists, the dimension of the tangent bundle must fulfill an equation relating the dimension of the tangent bundle to the dimension of the base. In particular, when the dimension function is a strong tangent dimension, Theorem 3.8 shows that the dimension of the tangent bundles is either twice the dimension of the base, or equal to the dimension of the base. Many examples of dimension functions are provided to demonstrate the utility of the definition. In particular, a consequence of Theorem 3.7 is that there are limitations on which functors may be tangent bundle endofunctors for a category. We show that this means that there are no non-trivial tangent structures on sets, as an example.</description>

      <title>The lattice of smooth sublocales as a Bruns-Lakser completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the frame morphisms $f:L\to M$ that lift to frame maps $\overline{f}:\mathsf{S}_b(L)\to \mathsf{S}_b(M)$, where $\mathsf{S}_b(L)$ is the collection of joins of complemented sublocales of a frame $L$, or equivalently the Booleanization of the collection $\mathsf{S}(L)$ of all its sublocales. We do so by proving that $\mathsf{S}_b(L)$ is isomorphic to the Bruns--Lakser completion of the meet-semilattice formed by the locally closed sublocales, i.e. the sublocales of the form $\mathfrak{c}(a)\cap \mathfrak{o}(b)$ for $a,b\in L$.</description>

      <title>A Knaster--Reichbach type theorem for graph structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a generic object $\mathbb{P}$ in the category of finite graphs. It turns out that this object, being topologically a Cantor set, has the Knaster--Reichbach type property. Namely, every homeomorphism and isomorphism $h\colon K\to L$ where $K$ and $L$ are nowhere dense closed sets in $\mathbb{P}$ and consisting only of isolated vertices in $K$ and $L$ can be extended to the autohomeomorphism and autoisomorphism of the whole graph $\mathbb{P}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Projective Resolutions, M\"obius Inversion, and Bottleneck Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the \emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules.
  On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions.
  We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and M\"obius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for M\"obius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</description>

      <title>Resolutions as directed colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07197v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general principle suggests that "anything flat is a directed colimit of countably presentable flats". In this paper, we consider resolutions and coresolutions of modules over a countably coherent ring $R$ (e.g., any coherent ring or any countably Noetherian ring). We show that any $R$-module of flat dimension $n$ is a directed colimit of countably presentable $R$-modules of flat dimension at most $n$, and any flatly coresolved $R$-module is a directed colimit of countably presentable flatly coresolved $R$-modules. If $R$ is a countably coherent ring with a dualizing complex, then any F-totally acyclic complex of flat $R$-modules is a directed colimit of F-totally acyclic complexes of countably presentable flat $R$-modules. The proofs are applications of an even more general category-theoretic principle going back to an unpublished 1977 preprint of Ulmer. Our proof of the assertion that every Gorenstein-flat module over a countably coherent ring is a directed colimit of countably presentable Gorenstein-flat modules uses a different technique, based on results of Saroch and Stovicek. We also discuss totally acyclic complexes of injectives and Gorenstein-injective modules, obtaining various cardinality estimates for the accessibility rank under various assumptions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory IV: Morphisms, Equivalences, and Categorical Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete the foundational architecture of Algebraic Phase Theory by developing a categorical and $2$-categorical framework for algebraic phases. Building on the structural notions introduced in Papers~I-III, we define phase morphisms, equivalence relations, and intrinsic invariants compatible with the canonical filtration and defect stratification.
  For finite, strongly admissible phases we establish strong rigidity theorems: phase morphisms are uniquely determined by their action on rigid cores, and under bounded defect, weak, strong, and Morita-type equivalence all coincide. In particular, finite strongly admissible phases admit no distinct models with the same filtered representation theory. We further show that structural boundaries are invariant under Morita-type equivalence and therefore constitute genuine categorical invariants.
  Algebraic phases, phase morphisms, and filtration-compatible natural transformations form a strict $2$-category in the strongly admissible regime. We also prove that completion defines a reflective localization of this category, with complete phases characterized as universal forced rigidifications.
  Together, these results elevate Algebraic Phase Theory from a collection of algebraic constructions to a categorical framework in which rigidity, equivalence collapse, boundary invariance, and completion arise as intrinsic consequences of phase interaction, finiteness, and admissibility.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>
