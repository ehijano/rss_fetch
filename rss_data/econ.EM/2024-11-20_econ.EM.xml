      <title>Prediction-Guided Active Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here is the revised abstract, ensuring all characters are ASCII-compatible:
  In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Identification of Semiparametric Panel Multinomial Choice Models with Infinite-Dimensional Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust method for semiparametric identification and estimation in panel multinomial choice models, where we allow for infinite-dimensional fixed effects that enter into consumer utilities in an additively nonseparable way, thus incorporating rich forms of unobserved heterogeneity. Our identification strategy exploits multivariate monotonicity in parametric indexes, and uses the logical contraposition of an intertemporal inequality on choice probabilities to obtain identifying restrictions. We provide a consistent estimation procedure, and demonstrate the practical advantages of our method with Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical illustration on popcorn sales with the Nielsen data.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation in a Time-Varying Endogenous Random Coefficient Panel Data Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a correlated random coefficient linear panel data model, where regressors can be correlated with time-varying and individual-specific random coefficients through both a fixed effect and a time-varying random shock. I develop a new panel data-based identification method to identify the average partial effect and the local average response function. The identification strategy employs a sufficient statistic to control for the fixed effect and a conditional control variable for the random shock. Conditional on these two controls, the residual variation in the regressors is driven solely by the exogenous instrumental variables, and thus can be exploited to identify the parameters of interest. The constructive identification analysis leads to three-step series estimators, for which I establish rates of convergence and asymptotic normality. To illustrate the method, I estimate a heterogeneous Cobb-Douglas production function for manufacturing firms in China, finding substantial variations in output elasticities across firms.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference in General Bunching Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal econometric framework and tools for the identification and inference of a structural parameter in general bunching designs. We present both point and partial identification results, which generalize previous approaches in the literature. The key assumption for point identification is the analyticity of the counterfactual density, which defines a broader class of distributions than many well-known parametric families. In the partial identification approach, the analyticity condition is relaxed and various shape restrictions can be incorporated, including those found in the literature. Both of our identification results account for observable heterogeneity in the model, which has previously been permitted only in limited ways. We provide a suite of counterfactual estimation and inference methods, termed the generalized polynomial strategy. Our method restores the merits of the original polynomial strategy proposed by Chetty et al. (2011) while addressing several weaknesses in the widespread practice. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated compared to a version of the polynomial estimator in a series of Monte Carlo studies within the augmented isoelastic model. We revisit the data used in Saez (2010) and find substantially different results relative to those from the polynomial strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.09173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides welfare metrics for dynamic choice. We give estimation and inference methods for functions of the expected value of dynamic choice. These parameters include average value by group, average derivatives with respect to endowments, and structural decompositions. The example of dynamic discrete choice is considered. We give dual and doubly robust representations of these parameters. A least squares estimator of the dynamic Riesz representer for the parameter of interest is given. Debiased machine learners are provided and asymptotic theory given.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public policies and medical interventions often involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where individuals receive a series of interventions over multiple stages. We study the statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's evolving history. We propose a doubly robust, classification-based approach to learning the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. This approach learns the optimal DTR through backward induction. At each step, it constructs an augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the policy value function and maximizes it to learn the optimal policy for the corresponding stage. We show that the resulting DTR can achieve an optimal convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for welfare regret under mild convergence conditions on estimators of the nuisance components.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>
