      <title>Endogenous transformation of land transport in Europe for different climate targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road transport is responsible for about a quarter of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, making its transformation a crucial part of Europe's overall decarbonization goals. Current European policies promote decarbonizing the transport sector and passenger car sales show an increased adoption of electric vehicles. Full electrification of land transport will significantly increase the average electricity demand but the use of smart charging and vehicle-to-grid could provide additional flexibility to balance wind and solar generation. In this study, we find cost-optimal transition pathways of the European land transport sector embedded in the sector-coupled open energy model PyPSA-Eur. We consider fossil-fueled, hydrogen-fueled, and electric cars using a 3-hour time resolution for a full year and covering 33 interconnected European countries. We analyze a transition path from 2025 to 2050 under different carbon budgets corresponding to a 1.7{\deg}C and 2{\deg}C temperature increase. Our results show that rapid electrification of road transport reduces the total system cost, even in the absence of climate targets. We see a clear preference for rapidly decommissioning internal combustion engine vehicles and using electric vehicles in all countries and under all carbon budgets. Allowing smart charging of electric vehicles decreases the total system cost by 1.6% because it reduces the need to install stationary batteries by almost 40%.</description>

      <title>Efficient inference of rankings from multi-body comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the existing approaches to assess and predict the performance of players, teams or products in competitive contests rely on the assumption that comparisons occur between pairs of such entities. There are, however, several real contests where more than two entities are part of each comparison, e.g., sports tournaments,multiplayer board and card games, and preference surveys. The Plackett-Luce (PL) model provides a principled approach to infer the ranking of entities involved in such contests characterized by multi-body comparisons. Unfortunately, traditional algorithms used to compute PL rankings suffer from slow convergence limiting the application of the PL model to relatively small-scale systems. We present here an alternative implementation that allows for significant speed-ups and validate its efficiency in both synthetic and real-world sets of data. Further, we perform systematic cross-validation tests concerning the ability of the PL model to predict unobserved comparisons. We find that a PL model trained on a set composed of multi-body comparisons is more predictive than a PL model trained on a set of projected pairwise comparisons derived from the very same training set, emphasizing the need of properly accounting for the true multi-body nature of real-world systems whenever such an information is available.</description>

      <title>Understanding the importance of SHAPE to the UK research ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rivers are well-known to exhibit fractal-like properties that lead to existence of scaling laws that link network geometry and size. However, these geometric relations might not necessarily capture the spatial features that most directly influence ecological processes such as the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Connectivity metrics, on the other hand, have been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we establish how river network connectivity scales with system size by analyzing networks obtained for more than 1000 rivers across the globe. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the Harmonic and Betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. We then created a synthetic river network dataset by fitting an Optimal Channel Network (OCN) model to each real river, to ask if OCNs, which are widely used to represent rivers in many theoretical studies, exhibit the same connectivity scaling laws as empirical river networks. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws by varying species movement strategies from perfect shortest-path navigation to unbiased random walks. Surprisingly, we found that random walk movement breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barab\'asi-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.</description>

      <title>Examining Online Social Support for Countering QAnon Conspiracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As radical messaging has proliferated on social networking sites, platforms like Reddit have been used to host support groups, including support communities for the families and friends of radicalized individuals. This study examines the subreddit r/QAnonCasualties, an online forum for users whose loved ones have been radicalized by QAnon. We collected 1,665 posts and 78,171 comments posted between 7/2021 and 7/2022 and content coded top posts for prominent themes. Sentiment analysis was also conducted on all posts. We find venting, advice and validation-seeking, and pressure to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine were prominent themes. 40% (n=167) of coded posts identified the Q relation(s) of users as their parent(s) and 16.3% (n=68) as their partner. Posts with higher proportions of words related to swearing, social referents, and physical needs were positively correlated with engagement. These findings show ways that communities around QAnon adherents leverage anonymous online spaces to seek and provide social support.</description>

      <title>An oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism for tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tides represent the daily alternations of high and low waters along coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean water to the Moon's (Sun's) gravitational force. However, although the purely hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory, we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from 33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal Model, OSU Tidal Inversion software-GN ,STORMTIDE model, OSU Tidal Inversion Software-ERB,STM-1B, and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model to be 59.93, 51.64, 57.05, 38.56, 86.92, and 53.56 cm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Why is the estimation of metaorder impact with public market data so challenging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating market impact and transaction costs of large trades (metaorders) is a very important topic in finance. However, using models of price and trade based on public market data provide average price trajectories which are qualitatively different from what is observed during real metaorder executions: the price increases linearly, rather than in a concave way, during the execution and the amount of reversion after its end is very limited. We claim that this is a generic phenomenon due to the fact that even sophisticated statistical models are unable to correctly describe the origin of the autocorrelation of the order flow. We propose a modified Transient Impact Model which provides more realistic trajectories by assuming that only a fraction of the metaorder trading triggers market order flow. Interestingly, in our model there is a critical condition on the kernels of the price and order flow equations in which market impact becomes permanent.</description>

      <title>Geospatial distributions reflect rates of evolution of features of language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the speed of linguistic change is challenging due to the fact that the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.</description>

      <title>Community-centric modeling of citation dynamics explains collective citation patterns in science, law, and patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many human knowledge systems, such as science, law, and invention, are built on documents and the citations that link them. Citations, while serving multiple purposes, primarily function as a way to explicitly document the use of prior work and thus have become central to the study of knowledge systems. Analyzing citation dynamics has revealed statistical patterns that shed light on knowledge production, recognition, and formalization, and has helped identify key mechanisms driving these patterns. However, most quantitative findings are confined to scientific citations, raising the question of universality of these findings. Moreover, existing models of individual citation trajectories fail to explain phenomena such as delayed recognition, calling for a unifying framework. Here, we analyze a newly available corpus of U.S. case law, in addition to scientific and patent citation networks, to show that they share remarkably similar citation patterns, including a heavy-tailed distribution of sleeping beauties. We propose a holistic model that captures the three core mechanisms driving collective dynamics and replicates the elusive phenomenon of delayed recognition. We demonstrate that the model not only replicates observed citation patterns, but also better predicts future successes by considering the whole system. Our work offers insights into key mechanisms that govern large-scale patterns of collective human knowledge systems and may provide generalizable perspectives on discovery and innovation across domains.</description>

      <title>Effects of clustering heterogeneity on the spectral density of sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact equations for the spectral density of sparse networks with an arbitrary distribution of the number of single edges and triangles per node. These equations enable a systematic investigation of the effect of clustering on the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix. In the case of heterogeneous networks, we demonstrate that the spectral density becomes more symmetric as the fluctuations in the triangle-degree sequence increase. This phenomenon is explained by the small clustering coefficient of networks with a large variance of the triangle-degree distribution. In the homogeneous case of regular clustered networks, we find that both perturbative and non-perturbative approximations fail to predict the spectral density in the high-connectivity limit. This suggests that traditional large-degree approximations may be ineffective in studying the spectral properties of networks with more complex motifs. Our theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of finite adjacency matrices.</description>
