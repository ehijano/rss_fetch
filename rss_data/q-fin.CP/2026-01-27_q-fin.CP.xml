      <title>The Compounded BSDE method: A fully-forward method for option pricing and optimal stopping problems in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Compound BSDE method, a fully forward, deep-learning-based approach for solving a broad class of problems in financial mathematics, including optimal stopping. The method is based on a reformulation of option pricing problems in terms of a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), which offers a new perspective on the numerical treatment of compound options and optimal stopping problems such as Bermudan option pricing. Building on the classical deep BSDE method for a single BSDE, we develop an algorithm for compound BSDEs and establish its convergence properties. In particular, we derive an \emph{a posteriori} error estimate for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach, and illustrate its effectiveness for high-dimensional option pricing and optimal stopping problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategy and deep hedging for share repurchase programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, companies have frequently adopted share repurchase programs to return capital to shareholders or for other strategic purposes, instructing investment banks to rapidly buy back shares on their behalf. When the executing institution is allowed to hedge its exposure, it encounters several challenges due to the intrinsic features of the product. Moreover, contractual clauses or market regulations on trading activity may make it infeasible to rely on Greeks. In this work, we address the hedging of these products by developing a machine-learning framework that determines the optimal execution of the buyback while explicitly accounting for the bank's actual trading capabilities. This unified treatment of execution and hedging yields substantial performance improvements, resulting in an optimized policy that provides a feasible and realistic hedging approach. The pricing of these programs can be framed in terms of the discount that banks offer to the client on the price at which the shares are delivered. Since, in our framework, risk measures serve as objective functions, we exploit the concept of indifference pricing to compute this discount, thereby capturing the actual execution performance.</description>
