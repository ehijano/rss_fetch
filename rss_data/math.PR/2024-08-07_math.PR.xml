      <title>Generalized front propagation for spatial stochastic population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework which can be used to prove that, in an annealed sense, rescaled spatial stochastic population models converge to generalized propagating fronts. Our work is motivated by recent results of Etheridge, Freeman, and Penington [EFP2017] and Huang and Durrett [HD2021], who proved convergence to classical mean curvature flow (MCF) for certain spatial stochastic processes, up until the first time when singularities of MCF form. Our arguments rely on the level-set method and the abstract approach to front propagation introduced by Barles and Souganidis [BS1998].
  This approach is amenable to stochastic models equipped with moment duals which satisfy certain general and verifiable properties. Our main results improve the existing results in several ways, first by removing regularity conditions on the initial data, and second by establishing convergence beyond the formation of singularities of MCF. In particular, we obtain a general convergence theorem which holds globally in time. This is then applied to all of the models considered in [EFP2017] and [HD2021].</description>

      <title>SIG-BSDE for Dynamic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider dynamic risk measures induced by backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). We discuss different examples that come up in the literature, including the entropic risk measure and the risk measure arising from the ambiguous interest rate problem. We develop a numerical algorithm for solving a BSDE using the backward Euler-Maruyama scheme and the universal approximation theorem for the signature of a path. We prove the convergence theorem and use the algorithm to solve some examples of dynamic risk measures induced by BSDEs. At last a deep learning approach is included for solving the ambiguous interest rate problem as well.</description>

      <title>The multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the notion of multivariate fractional Brownian Motion introduced in [F. Lavancier, A. Philippe, and D. Surgailis. Covariance function of vector self-similar processes. Statistics &amp; Probability Letters, 2009] we define a multivariate version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This multivariate Gaussian process is stationary, ergodic and allows for different Hurst exponents on each component. We characterize its correlation matrix and its short and long time asymptotics. Besides the marginal parameters, the cross correlation between one-dimensional marginal components is ruled by two parameters. We consider the problem of their inference, proposing two types of estimator, constructed from discrete observations of the process. We establish their asymptotic theory, in one case in the long time asymptotic setting, in the other case in the infill and long time asymptotic setting. The limit behavior can be asymptotically Gaussian or non-Gaussian, depending on the values of the Hurst exponents of the marginal components. The technical core of the paper relies on the analysis of asymptotic properties of functionals of Gaussian processes, that we establish using Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. We provide numerical experiments that support our theoretical analysis and also suggest a conjecture on the application of one of these estimators to the multivariate fractional Brownian Motion.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the number of crossings and stress in projections of the random geometric graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the number of edge crossings in a random graph drawing generated by projecting a random geometric graph on some compact convex set $W\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$, onto a plane. The positions of these crossings form the support of a point process. We show that if the expected number of crossings converges to a positive but finite value, this point process converges to a Poisson point process in the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance. We further show a multivariate central limit theorem between the number of crossings and a second variable called the stress that holds when the expected vertex degree in the random geometric graph converges to a positive finite value.</description>

      <title>Uniform log-Sobolev inequalites for mean field particles with flat-convex energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to demonstrate uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for the mean field gradient particle systems associated to an energy functional that is convex in the flat sense. A defective log-Sobolev inequality was already established implicitly in a previous joint work with F. Chen and Z. Ren [arXiv:2212.03050 [math.PR]]. It remains only to tighten it by a uniform Poincar\'e inequality, which we prove by the method in a recent work of Guillin, W. Liu, L. Wu and C. Zhang [Ann. Appl. Probab., 32(3):1590-1614, 2022]. As an application, we show that the particle system exhibits the concentration of measure phenomenon in the long time.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of the Laplacian on random covers of a closed negatively curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,g)$ be a closed, connected surface, with variable negative curvature. We consider the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on random covers $X_n\to X$ of degree $n$. We focus on the ensemble variance of the smoothed number of eigenvalues of the square root of the positive Laplacian $\sqrt{\Delta}$ in windows $[\lambda-\frac 1L,\lambda+\frac 1L]$, over the set of $n$-sheeted covers of $X$. We first take the limit of large degree $n\to +\infty$, then we let the energy $\lambda$ go to $+\infty$ while the window size $\frac 1L$ goes to $0$. In this ad hoc limit, local energy averages of the variance converge to an expression corresponding to the variance of the same statistic when considering instead spectra of large random matrices of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). By twisting the Laplacian with unitary representations, we are able to observe different statistics, corresponding to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) when time reversal symmetry is broken. These results were shown by F. Naud for the model of random covers of a hyperbolic surface.
  For an individual cover $X_n\to X$, we consider spectral fluctuations of the counting function on $X_n$ around the ensemble average. In the large energy regime, for a typical cover $X_n\to X$ of large degree, these fluctuations are shown to approach the GOE result, a phenomenon called ergodicity in Random Matrix Theory. An analogous result for random covers of hyperbolic surfaces was obtained by Y. Maoz.</description>

      <title>Numerical Ergodicity of Stochastic Allen--Cahn Equation driven by Multiplicative White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the unique ergodicity of a fully discrete scheme for monotone SPDEs with polynomial growth drift and bounded diffusion coefficients driven by multiplicative white noise. The main ingredient of our method depends on the satisfaction of a Lyapunov condition followed by a uniform moments' estimate, combined with the irreducibility and the strong Feller property for full discretization. We transform the original stochastic equation into an equivalent random equation where the discrete stochastic convolutions are uniformly controlled to derive the desired uniform moments' estimate. Applying the main result to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation driven by multiplicative white noise indicates that this full discretization is uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Note on Return Probability Behaviors in Random Environments of Conductances</title>

      <description>arXiv:1603.06323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the trapping phenomenon of random walks in random environments of i.i.d. non-negative random conductances on the bonds of the grid $\mathbb{Z}^d$, the so-called Random Conductance Model. For the important case of conductances in $[0, 1]$ with polynomial-tailed law near zero, we provide an intriguing improvement of the anomalous return probability lower bound. In a symmetrical situation with conductances in $[1, \infty)$ with a polynomial law at infinity, by adapting the same argument, we obtain interesting results that also show opposite behaviors for the constant speed random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a proof showing that the weak error of a system of $n$ interacting stochastic particles approximating the solution of the McKean-Vlasov equation is $\mathcal O(n^{-1})$. Our proof is based on the Kolmogorov backward equation for the particle system and bounds on the derivatives of its solution, which we derive more generally using the variations of the stochastic particle system. The convergence rate is verified by numerical experiments, which also indicate that the assumptions made here and in the literature can be relaxed.</description>

      <title>Bonabeau model on fully occupied site graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bonabeau model is a competing model where agents fight to maintain or change their positions. Originally studied on a finite lattice, in this model, one agent is randomly selected to move to a neighboring site chosen at random. If the neighboring site is vacant, the agent moves there. However, if the site is occupied, a fight ensues. If the agent wins, they switch places with the other agent; otherwise, they remain in their original position. We investigate the Bonabeau model on fully occupied site graphs and derive a critical bound for the stability of the egalitarian state applicable to all fully occupied connected site graphs. Furthermore, we develop a competing model where all fights end in finite time on all site graphs.</description>

      <title>Strongly Efficient Rare-Event Simulation for Regularly Varying L\'evy Processes with Infinite Activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address rare-event simulation for heavy-tailed L\'evy processes with infinite activities. The presence of infinite activities poses a critical challenge, making it impractical to simulate or store the precise sample path of the L\'evy process. We present a rare-event simulation algorithm that incorporates an importance sampling strategy based on heavy-tailed large deviations, the stick-breaking approximation for the extrema of L\'evy processes, the Asmussen-Rosi\'nski approximation, and the randomized debiasing technique. By establishing a novel characterization for the Lipschitz continuity of the law of L\'evy processes, we show that the proposed algorithm is unbiased and strongly efficient under mild conditions, and hence applicable to a broad class of L\'evy processes. In numerical experiments, our algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency compared to the crude Monte-Carlo approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multiple chordal SLEs with $\kappa\in (0,8)$. Under common time parameterization, we show that the transition density of the driving function of multiple chordal SLEs can be given by the transition density of Dyson Brownian motion and Green's function. We give two consequences of such connection: first, we show that the driving function of multiple chordal SLEs, conditional on the rare event that it survives forever, becomes Dyson Brownian motion; second, we derive the asymptotic of the probability for multiple chordal SLEs to hit a small neighborhood of a boundary point. This is a companion paper of~[FWY24]. We also extend previous results in~[FWY24] from $\kappa\in (0,4]$ to $\kappa\in (0,8)$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion approximation of the stationary distribution of a two-level single server queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11284v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single server queue which has a threshold to change its arrival process and service rate by its queue length, which is referred to as a two-level single server queue. This model is motivated by an energy saving problem for a single server queue whose arrival process and service rate may be changed. To get its performance in tractable form, we study in the limit of the stationary distribution of this two-level queue under a certain scaling in heavy traffic, which corresponds to a diffusion approximation. It is shown that this limiting distribution is truncated exponential below the threshold level and exponential above it under suitably chosen system parameters. This result is proved using the so called BAR approach studied in Braverman, Dai and Miyazawa (2017, 2023) and Miyazawa (2017, 2023). We also intuitively discuss about a diffusion process corresponding to the limit of the stationary distributions.</description>

      <title>Formal Error Bounds for the State Space Reduction of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation of a Markov chain on a reduced state space, for both discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains. In this context, we extend the existing theory of formal error bounds for the approximated transient distributions. As a special case, we consider aggregated (or lumped) Markov chains, where the state space reduction is achieved by partitioning the state space into macro states. In the discrete-time setting, we bound the stepwise increment of the error, and in the continuous-time setting, we bound the rate at which the error grows. In addition, the same error bounds can also be applied to bound how far an approximated stationary distribution is from stationarity. Subsequently, we compare these error bounds with relevant concepts from the literature, such as exact and ordinary lumpability, as well as deflatability and aggregatability. These concepts define stricter than necessary conditions to identify settings in which the aggregation error is zero. We also consider possible algorithms for finding suitable aggregations for which the formal error bounds are low, and we analyse first experiments with these algorithms on a range of different models.</description>

      <title>Conditioning of Banach Space Valued Gaussian Random Variables: An Approximation Approach Based on Martingales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. We show that these conditional distributions are again Gaussian and that their means and covariances are determined by a general finite dimensional approximation scheme based upon a martingale approach. In particular, it turns out that the covariance operators occurring in this scheme converge with respect to the nuclear norm and that the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss in detail, how our approximation scheme can be implemented in several classes of important Banach spaces such as (reproducing kernel) Hilbert spaces and spaces of continuous functions. As an example, we then apply our general results to the case of Gaussian processes with continuous paths conditioned to partial but infinite observations of their paths. Here we show that conditioning on sufficiently rich, increasing sets of finitely many observations leads to consistent approximations, that is, both the mean and covariance functions converge uniformly and the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss how these results improve our understanding of the popular Gaussian processes for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing in Sparse Random Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the community detection problem in Bayesian inference, as well as the recent explosion of interest in spin glasses from statistical physics, we study the classical Glauber dynamics for sampling from Ising models with sparse random interactions. It is now well-known that when the interaction matrix has spectral diameter less than $1$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $O(n\log n)$ steps. Unfortunately, such criteria fail dramatically for interactions supported on arguably the most well-studied sparse random graph: the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, due to the presence of almost linearly many outlier eigenvalues of unbounded magnitude.
  We prove that for the \emph{Viana--Bray spin glass}, where the interactions are supported on $G(n,d/n)$ and randomly assigned $\pm\beta$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time with high probability as long as $\beta \le O(1/\sqrt{d})$, independent of $n$. We further extend our results to random graphs drawn according to the $2$-community stochastic block model, as well as when the interactions are given by a "centered" version of the adjacency matrix. The latter setting is particularly relevant for the inference problem in community detection. Indeed, we use this to show that Glauber dynamics succeeds at recovering communities in the stochastic block model in a companion paper [LMR+24].
  The primary technical ingredient in our proof is showing that with high probability, a sparse random graph can be decomposed into two parts -- a \emph{bulk} which behaves like a graph with bounded maximum degree and a well-behaved spectrum, and a \emph{near-forest} with favorable pseudorandom properties. We then use this decomposition to design a localization procedure that interpolates to simpler Ising models supported only on the near-forest, and then execute a pathwise analysis to establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenmaps are important in analysis, geometry, and machine learning, especially in nonlinear dimension reduction. Approximation of the eigenmaps of a Laplace operator depends crucially on the scaling parameter $\epsilon$. If $\epsilon$ is too small or too large, then the approximation is inaccurate or completely breaks down. However, an analytic expression for the optimal $\epsilon$ is out of reach. In our work, we use some explicitly solvable models and Monte Carlo simulations to find the approximately optimal range of $\epsilon$ that gives, on average, relatively accurate approximation of the eigenmaps. Numerically we can consider several model situations where eigen-coordinates can be computed analytically, including intervals with uniform and weighted measures, squares, tori, spheres, and the Sierpinski gasket. In broader terms, we intend to study eigen-coordinates on weighted Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary, and on some metric measure spaces, such as fractals.</description>

      <title>Classifying the Concentration of the Boolean Cube for Dependent Distributions</title>

Abstract: A metric probability space $(\Omega,d)$ obeys the ${\it concentration\; of\; measure\; phenomenon}$ if subsets of measure $1/2$ enlarge to subsets of measure close to 1 as a transition parameter $\epsilon$ approaches a limit. In this paper we consider the concentration of the space itself, namely the concentration of the metric $d(x,y)$ for a fixed $y\in \Omega$. For any $y\in \Omega$, the concentration of $d(x,y)$ is guaranteed for product distributions in high dimensions $n$, as $d(x,y)$ is a Lipschitz function in $x$. In fact, in the product setting, the rate at which the metric concentrates is of the same order in $n$ for any fixed $y\in \Omega$. The same thing, however, cannot be said for certain dependent (non-product) distributions. For the Boolean cube $I_n$ (a widely analyzed simple model), we show that, for any dependent distribution, the rate of concentration of the Hamming distance $d_H(x,y)$, for a fixed $y$, depends on the choice of $y\in I_n$, and on the variance of the conditional distributions $\mu(x_k \mid x_1,\dots, x_{k-1})$, $2\leq k\leq n$. We give an inductive bound which holds for all probability distributions on the Boolean cube, and characterize the quality of concentration by a certain positive (negative) correlation condition. Our method of proof is advantageous in that it is both simple and comprehensive. We consider uniform bounding techniques when the variance of the conditional distributions is negligible, and show how this basic technique applies to the concentration of the entire class of Lipschitz functions on the Boolean cube.</description>

      <title>Locally Stationary Distributions: A Framework for Analyzing Slow-Mixing Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural Markov chains fail to mix to their stationary distribution in polynomially many steps. Often, this slow mixing is inevitable since it is computationally intractable to sample from their stationary measure.
  Nevertheless, Markov chains can be shown to always converge quickly to measures that are locally stationary, i.e., measures that don't change over a small number of steps. These locally stationary measures are analogous to local minima in continuous optimization, while stationary measures correspond to global minima.
  While locally stationary measures can be statistically far from stationary measures, do they enjoy provable theoretical guarantees that have algorithmic implications? We study this question in this work and demonstrate three algorithmic applications of locally stationary measures:
  1. We show that Glauber dynamics on the hardcore model can be used to find independent sets of size $\Omega\left(\frac{\log d}{d} \cdot n\right)$ in triangle-free graphs of degree at most $d$.
  2. Let $W$ be a symmetric real matrix with bounded spectral diameter and $v$ be a unit vector. Given the matrix $M = \lambda vv^\top + W$ with a planted rank-one spike along vector $v$, for sufficiently large constant $\lambda$, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the vector $v$.
  3. Let $M = A_{\mathbf{G}} - \frac{d}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top$ be a centered version of the adjacency matrix where the graph $\mathbf{G}$ is drawn from a sparse 2-community stochastic block model. We show that for sufficiently large constant signal-to-noise ratio, Glauber dynamics on the Ising model defined by $M$ samples vectors $x \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ that have constant correlation with the hidden community vector $\mathbf{\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>A concise proof of Benford's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a concise proof of the famous Benford's law when the distribution has a Riemann integrable probability density function and provides a criterion to judge whether a distribution obeys the law. The proof is intuitive and elegant, accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of calculus, revealing that the law originates from the basic property of the human number system. The criterion can bring great convenience to the field of fraud detection.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Temperature MCMC threshold: the cases of sparse tensor PCA, sparse regression, and a geometric rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last years, there has been a significant amount of work studying the power of specific classes of computationally efficient estimators for multiple statistical parametric estimation tasks, including the estimators classes of low-degree polynomials, spectral methods, and others. Despite that, our understanding of the important class of MCMC methods remains quite poorly understood. For instance, for many models of interest, the performance of even zero-temperature (greedy-like) MCMC methods that simply maximize the posterior remains elusive.
  In this work, we provide an easy to check condition under which the low-temperature Metropolis chain maximizes the posterior in polynomial-time with high probability. The result is generally applicable, and in this work, we use it to derive positive MCMC results for two classical sparse estimation tasks: the sparse tensor PCA model and sparse regression. Interestingly, in both cases, we also leverage the Overlap Gap Property framework for inference (Gamarnik, Zadik AoS '22) to prove that our results are tight: no low-temperature local MCMC method can achieve better performance. In particular, our work identifies the "low-temperature (local) MCMC threshold" for both sparse models. Interestingly, in the sparse tensor PCA model our results indicate that low-temperature local MCMC methods significantly underperform compared to other studied time-efficient methods, such as the class of low-degree polynomials.</description>
