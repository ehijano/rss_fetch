      <title>A Simple Learning-Augmented Algorithm for Online Packing with Concave Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms has been extensively studied recently in the computer-science community, due to the potential of using machine learning predictions in order to improve the performance of algorithms. Predictions are especially useful for online algorithms making irrevocable decisions without knowledge of the future. Such learning-augmented algorithms aim to overcome the limitations of classical online algorithms when the predictions are accurate, and still perform comparably when the predictions are inaccurate.
  A common approach is to adapt existing online algorithms to the particular advice notion employed, which often involves understanding previous sophisticated algorithms and their analyses. However, ideally, one would simply use previous online solutions in a black-box fashion, without much loss in the approximation guarantees. Such clean solutions that avoid opening up black-boxes are often rare, and may be even missed the first time around. For example, Grigorescu et al. (NeurIPS 22) proposed a learning-augmented algorithms for online covering linear programs, but it later turned out that their results can be subsumed by a natural approach that switches between the advice and an online algorithm given as a black-box, as noted in their paper.
  In this work, we introduce and analyze a simple learning-augmented algorithm for online packing problems with linear constraints and concave objectives. We exhibit several direct applications of our framework including online packing linear programming, knapsack, resource management benefit, throughput maximization, and network utility maximization. We further raise the problem of understanding necessary and sufficient conditions for when such simple black-box solutions may be optimal. We believe this is an important direction of research that would unify many ad-hoc approaches from the literature.</description>

      <title>Maximum Flow by Augmenting Paths in $n^{2+o(1)}$ Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial algorithm for computing exact maximum flows in directed graphs with $n$ vertices and edge capacities from $\{1,\dots,U\}$ in $n^{2+o(1)}\log U$ time, which is almost optimal in dense graphs. Our algorithm is a novel implementation of the classical augmenting-path framework; we list augmenting paths more efficiently using a new variant of the push-relabel algorithm that uses additional edge weights to guide the algorithm, and we derive the edge weights by constructing a directed expander hierarchy.
  Even in unit-capacity graphs, this breaks the long-standing $O(m\cdot\min\{\sqrt{m},n^{2/3}\})$ time bound of the previous combinatorial algorithms by Karzanov (1973) and Even and Tarjan (1975) when the graph has $m=\omega(n^{4/3})$ edges. Notably, our approach does not rely on continuous optimization nor heavy dynamic graph data structures, both of which are crucial in the recent developments that led to the almost-linear time algorithm by Chen et al. (FOCS 2022). Our running time also matches the $n^{2+o(1)}$ time bound of the independent combinatorial algorithm by Chuzhoy and Khanna (STOC 2024) for computing the maximum bipartite matching, a special case of maximum flow.</description>

      <title>Bidding in Uniform Price Auctions for Value Maximizing Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of bidding in uniform price auctions widely used in practice. Although these auctions are non-truthful for bidders with quasilinear utility functions, several empirical findings suggest that the auction format induces truthful bidding from the bidders. We attribute this difference in theory and practice to the assumption of the behavioral model of the bidders. In this pursuit, we study uniform price auctions in a repeated setting from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize their acquired cumulative value across $T$ rounds, subject to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints. For a RoI-constrained, value-maximizing buyer, we study a generalized version of the uniform bidding format, commonly used in practice, which we term as $m$-uniform bidding. To characterize the optimal $m$-uniform bid, we introduce and study the notion of universally feasible (UF) bidding policies, which are robust, meaning that RoI feasibility is obtained regardless of the competitors' bids. We show that the optimal class of UF bidding policies is essentially a generalization of truthful bidding policies, which depends only on the valuation curve of the bidder and target RoI. To measure the performance of UF bidding policies against the optimal bidding policy that is not necessarily UF, we introduce a metric called the Price of Universal Feasibility (PoUF) and establish that PoUF is at most 2, irrespective of $m$ and the upper bound is tight. We further compare the generalized $m$-uniform bidding interface against the classical uniform bidding format under which $m=1$, showing the total value under $m$-uniform bidding increases at most by a factor of $m$. Numerical simulations on semi-synthetic data demonstrate that UF bidding policies perform significantly better than the derived theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>A Nearly Optimal Deterministic Algorithm for Online Transportation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new deterministic algorithm called Subtree-Decomposition for the online transportation problem and show that the algorithm is $(8m-5)$-competitive, where $m$ is the number of server sites.
  It has long been known that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is lower bounded by $2m-1$ for this problem. On the other hand, the conjecture proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs in 1998 asking whether a deterministic $(2m-1)$-competitive algorithm exists for the online transportation problem has remained open for over two decades.
  The upper bound on the competitive ratio, $8m-5$, which is the result of this paper, is the first to come close to this conjecture, and is the best possible within a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Engineering Semi-streaming DFS algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth first search is a fundamental graph problem having a wide range of applications. For a graph $G=(V,E)$ having $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the DFS tree can be computed in $O(m+n)$ using $O(m)$ space where $m=O(n^2)$. In the streaming environment, most graph problems are studied in the semi-streaming model where several passes (preferably one) are allowed over the input, allowing $O(nk)$ local space for some $k=o(n)$. Trivially, using $O(m)$ space, DFS can be computed in one pass, and using $O(n)$ space, it can be computed in $O(n)$ passes.
  Khan and Mehta [STACS19] presented several algorithms allowing trade-offs between space and passes, where $O(nk)$ space results in $O(n/k)$ passes. They also empirically analyzed their algorithm to require only a few passes in practice for even $O(n)$ space. Chang et al. [STACS20] presented an alternate proof for the same and also presented $O(\sqrt{n})$ pass algorithm requiring $O(n~poly\log n)$ space with a finer trade-off between space and passes. However, their algorithm uses complex black box algorithms, making it impractical.
  We perform an experimental analysis of the practical semi-streaming DFS algorithms. Our analysis ranges from real graphs to random graphs (uniform and power-law). We also present several heuristics to improve the state-of-the-art algorithms and study their impact. Our heuristics improve state of the art by $40-90\%$, achieving optimal one pass in almost $40-50\%$ cases (improved from zero). In random graphs, they improve from $30-90\%$, again requiring optimal one pass for even very small values of $k$. Overall, our heuristics improved the relatively complex state-of-the-art algorithm significantly, requiring merely two passes in the worst case for random graphs. Additionally, our heuristics made the relatively simpler algorithm practically usable even for very small space bounds, which was impractical earlier.</description>

      <title>Private Online Learning via Lazy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of private online learning, specifically, online prediction from experts (OPE) and online convex optimization (OCO). We propose a new transformation that transforms lazy online learning algorithms into private algorithms. We apply our transformation for differentially private OPE and OCO using existing lazy algorithms for these problems. Our final algorithms obtain regret, which significantly improves the regret in the high privacy regime $\varepsilon \ll 1$, obtaining $\sqrt{T \log d} + T^{1/3} \log(d)/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OPE and $\sqrt{T} + T^{1/3} \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OCO. We also complement our results with a lower bound for DP-OPE, showing that these rates are optimal for a natural family of low-switching private algorithms.</description>

      <title>Finding maximum matchings in RDV graphs efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximum matching problem in RDV graphs, i.e., graphs that are vertex-intersection graphs of downward paths in a rooted tree. We show that this problem can be reduced to a problem of testing (repeatedly) whether a vertical segment intersects one of a dynamically changing set of horizontal segments, which in turn reduces to an orthogonal ray shooting query. Using a suitable data structure, we can therefore find a maximum matching in $O(n\log n)$ time (presuming a linear-sized representation of the graph is given), i.e., without even looking at all edges.</description>

      <title>Continual Counting with Gradual Privacy Expiration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy with gradual expiration models the setting where data items arrive in a stream and at a given time $t$ the privacy loss guaranteed for a data item seen at time $(t-d)$ is $\epsilon g(d)$, where $g$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function. We study the fundamental $\textit{continual (binary) counting}$ problem where each data item consists of a bit, and the algorithm needs to output at each time step the sum of all the bits streamed so far. For a stream of length $T$ and privacy $\textit{without}$ expiration continual counting is possible with maximum (over all time steps) additive error $O(\log^2(T)/\varepsilon)$ and the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\log(T)/\varepsilon)$; closing this gap is a challenging open problem.
  We show that the situation is very different for privacy with gradual expiration by giving upper and lower bounds for a large set of expiration functions $g$. Specifically, our algorithm achieves an additive error of $ O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$ for a large set of privacy expiration functions. We also give a lower bound that shows that if $C$ is the additive error of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm for this problem, then the product of $C$ and the privacy expiration function after $2C$ steps must be $\Omega(\log(T)/\epsilon)$. Our algorithm matches this lower bound as its additive error is $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$, even when $g(2C) = O(1)$.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that we achieve a slowly growing privacy loss with significantly smaller empirical privacy loss for large values of $d$ than a natural baseline algorithm.</description>

      <title>Eigenpath traversal by Poisson-distributed phase randomisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for quantum computation, similar to Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC), that is based on the quantum Zeno effect. By performing randomised dephasing operations at intervals determined by a Poisson process, we are able to track the eigenspace associated to a particular eigenvalue.
  We derive a simple differential equation for the fidelity, leading to general theorems bounding the time complexity of a whole class of algorithms. We also use eigenstate filtering to optimise the scaling of the complexity in the error tolerance $\epsilon$.
  In many cases the bounds given by our general theorems are optimal, giving a time complexity of $O(1/\Delta_m)$ with $\Delta_m$ the minimum of the gap. This allows us to prove optimal results using very general features of problems, minimising the problem-specific insight necessary.
  As two applications of our framework, we obtain optimal scaling for the Grover problem (i.e.\ $O(\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is the database size) and the Quantum Linear System Problem (i.e.\ $O(\kappa\log(1/\epsilon))$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number and $\epsilon$ the error tolerance) by direct applications of our theorems.</description>

      <title>On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a logarithmic in $r$ factor. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>

      <title>The CLRS-Text Algorithmic Reasoning Language Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eliciting reasoning capabilities from language models (LMs) is a critical direction on the path towards building intelligent systems. Most recent studies dedicated to reasoning focus on out-of-distribution performance on procedurally-generated synthetic benchmarks, bespoke-built to evaluate specific skills only. This trend makes results hard to transfer across publications, slowing down progress. Three years ago, a similar issue was identified and rectified in the field of neural algorithmic reasoning, with the advent of the CLRS benchmark. CLRS is a dataset generator comprising graph execution traces of classical algorithms from the Introduction to Algorithms textbook. Inspired by this, we propose CLRS-Text -- a textual version of these algorithmic traces. Out of the box, CLRS-Text is capable of procedurally generating trace data for thirty diverse, challenging algorithmic tasks across any desirable input distribution, while offering a standard pipeline in which any additional algorithmic tasks may be created in the benchmark. We fine-tune and evaluate various LMs as generalist executors on this benchmark, validating prior work and revealing a novel, interesting challenge for the LM reasoning community. Our code is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/clrs/tree/master/clrs/_src/clrs_text.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors. Various architectures have been proposed to address this ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures. Notable examples include GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices, or other invariant spectral features. However, the potential expressive power of these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear. The goal of this work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable when using spectral features. We first introduce a unified message-passing framework for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN). A comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent to EPNN. A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is also established. On the other hand, we prove that EPNN itself is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL. Finally, we discuss whether using spectral features can gain additional expressiveness when combined with more expressive GNNs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Embedding Dimension for Sparse Subspace Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random $m\times n$ matrix $S$ is an oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) with parameters $\epsilon&gt;0$, $\delta\in(0,1/3)$ and $d\leq m\leq n$, if for any $d$-dimensional subspace $W\subseteq R^n$,
  $P\big(\,\forall_{x\in W}\ (1+\epsilon)^{-1}\|x\|\leq\|Sx\|\leq (1+\epsilon)\|x\|\,\big)\geq 1-\delta.$
  It is known that the embedding dimension of an OSE must satisfy $m\geq d$, and for any $\theta &gt; 0$, a Gaussian embedding matrix with $m\geq (1+\theta) d$ is an OSE with $\epsilon = O_\theta(1)$. However, such optimal embedding dimension is not known for other embeddings. Of particular interest are sparse OSEs, having $s\ll m$ non-zeros per column, with applications to problems such as least squares regression and low-rank approximation.
  We show that, given any $\theta &gt; 0$, an $m\times n$ random matrix $S$ with $m\geq (1+\theta)d$ consisting of randomly sparsified $\pm1/\sqrt s$ entries and having $s= O(\log^4(d))$ non-zeros per column, is an oblivious subspace embedding with $\epsilon = O_{\theta}(1)$. Our result addresses the main open question posed by Nelson and Nguyen (FOCS 2013), who conjectured that sparse OSEs can achieve $m=O(d)$ embedding dimension, and it improves on $m=O(d\log(d))$ shown by Cohen (SODA 2016). We use this to construct the first oblivious subspace embedding with $O(d)$ embedding dimension that can be applied faster than current matrix multiplication time, and to obtain an optimal single-pass algorithm for least squares regression. We further extend our results to Leverage Score Sparsification (LESS), which is a recently introduced non-oblivious embedding technique. We use LESS to construct the first subspace embedding with low distortion $\epsilon=o(1)$ and optimal embedding dimension $m=O(d/\epsilon^2)$ that can be applied in current matrix multiplication time.</description>

Abstract: Given an undirected graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\VV}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\UU\subseteq\VV$ of vertices such that \UU forms a vertex cover, $w(\UU)=\sum_{u\in\UU} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\UU)=\sum_{u\in\UU} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\OO(\tw)}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where $\tw,s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Leverage Score Sampling for Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02749</link>

Abstract: Tensor Train~(TT) decomposition is widely used in the machine learning and quantum physics communities as a popular tool to efficiently compress high-dimensional tensor data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to accelerate computing the TT decomposition with the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm relying on exact leverage scores sampling. For this purpose, we propose a data structure that allows us to efficiently sample from the tensor with time complexity logarithmic in the tensor size. Our contribution specifically leverages the canonical form of the TT decomposition. By maintaining the canonical form through each iteration of ALS, we can efficiently compute (and sample from) the leverage scores, thus achieving significant speed-up in solving each sketched least-square problem. Experiments on synthetic and real data on dense and sparse tensors demonstrate that our method outperforms SVD-based and ALS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal solution sets for metric graph problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems from metric graph theory like Metric Dimension, Geodetic Set, and Strong Metric Dimension have recently had a strong impact in parameterized complexity by being the first known problems in NP to admit double-exponential lower bounds in the treewidth, and even in the vertex cover number for the latter, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. We initiate the study of enumerating minimal solution sets for these problems and show that they are also of great interest in enumeration. Specifically, we show that enumerating minimal resolving sets in graphs and minimal geodetic sets in split graphs are equivalent to enumerating minimal transversals in hypergraphs (denoted Trans-Enum), whose solvability in total-polynomial time is one of the most important open problems in algorithmic enumeration. This provides two new natural examples to a question that emerged in recent works: for which vertex (or edge) set graph property $\Pi$ is the enumeration of minimal (or maximal) subsets satisfying $\Pi$ equivalent to Trans-Enum? As very few properties are known to fit within this context -- namely, those related to minimal domination -- our results make significant progress in characterizing such properties, and provide new angles to approach Trans-Enum. In contrast, we observe that minimal strong resolving sets can be enumerated with polynomial delay. Additionally, we consider cases where our reductions do not apply, namely graphs with no long induced paths, and show both positive and negative results related to the enumeration and extension of partial solutions.</description>

      <title>Compressed and Sparse Models for Non-Convex Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05760</link>

Abstract: Recent research highlights frequent model communication as a significant bottleneck to the efficiency of decentralized machine learning (ML), especially for large-scale and over-parameterized neural networks (NNs). To address this, we present Malcom-PSGD, a novel decentralized ML algorithm that combines gradient compression techniques with model sparsification. We promote model sparsity by adding $\ell_1$ regularization to the objective and present a decentralized proximal SGD method for training. Our approach employs vector source coding and dithering-based quantization for the compressed gradient communication of sparsified models. Our analysis demonstrates that Malcom-PSGD achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ with respect to the iterations $t$, assuming a constant consensus and learning rate. This result is supported by our proof for the convergence of non-convex compressed Proximal SGD methods. Additionally, we conduct a bit analysis, providing a closed-form expression for the communication costs associated with Malcom-PSGD. Numerical results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method reduces communication costs by approximately $75\%$ when compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>How Private are DP-SGD Implementations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial gap between the privacy guarantees of the Adaptive Batch Linear Queries (ABLQ) mechanism under different types of batch sampling: (i) Shuffling, and (ii) Poisson subsampling; the typical analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) follows by interpreting it as a post-processing of ABLQ. While shuffling-based DP-SGD is more commonly used in practical implementations, it has not been amenable to easy privacy analysis, either analytically or even numerically. On the other hand, Poisson subsampling-based DP-SGD is challenging to scalably implement, but has a well-understood privacy analysis, with multiple open-source numerically tight privacy accountants available. This has led to a common practice of using shuffling-based DP-SGD in practice, but using the privacy analysis for the corresponding Poisson subsampling version. Our result shows that there can be a substantial gap between the privacy analysis when using the two types of batch sampling, and thus advises caution in reporting privacy parameters for DP-SGD.</description>
