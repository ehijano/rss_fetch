      <title>Symmetry of information for space-bounded online Kolmogorov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>

      <title>Improved Debordering of Waring Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a degree-$d$ homogeneous polynomial $f$ has border Waring rank $\underline{\mathrm{WR}}({f}) = r$, then its Waring rank is bounded by \[ {\mathrm{WR}}({f}) \leq d \cdot r^{O(\sqrt{r})}. \] This result significantly improves upon the recent bound ${\mathrm{WR}}({f}) \leq d \cdot 4^r$ established in [Dutta, Gesmundo, Ikenmeyer, Jindal, and Lysikov, STACS 2024], which itself was an improvement over the earlier bound ${\mathrm{WR}}({f}) \leq d^r$.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Hardness of Quantum One-Wayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output: respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators, the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators. This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c \log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit commitments.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Editing to Uniform Cluster Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of transforming graphs into Uniform Cluster graphs, where each component is an equal-sized clique. We consider Uniform Cluster Vertex Deletion (UCVD), Uniform Cluster Edge Deletion (UCED), Uniform Cluster Edge Addition (UCEA), Uniform Cluster Edge Editing (UCEE), Uniform Cluster Exclusive Vertex Splitting (UCEVS), and Uniform Cluster Inclusive Vertex Splitting (UCIVS). For UCVD, we provide a vertex kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k^{3})$ and an FPT algorithm with running time $2^{k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, improving the known $3^{k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm. For edge-based variants, we obtain a $\mathcal{O}(k^{2})$ vertex kernel for UCEE and linear vertex kernels for UCED and UCEA, improving the best-known results. Additionally, we present a $1.47^{k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm for UCED, improving upon the previous $2^{k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ bound. We develop a sub-exponential algorithm for UCED on everywhere dense graphs by reducing it to $d$-Way Cut. Lastly, we study vertex splitting operations and provide vertex kernels of size $4k$ for both UCIVS and UCEVS.</description>

      <title>It's Hard to HAC with Average Linkage!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average linkage Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is an extensively studied and applied method for hierarchical clustering. Recent applications to massive datasets have driven significant interest in near-linear-time and efficient parallel algorithms for average linkage HAC.
  We provide hardness results that rule out such algorithms. On the sequential side, we establish a runtime lower bound of $n^{3/2-\epsilon}$ on $n$ node graphs for sequential combinatorial algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions. This essentially matches the best-known running time for average linkage HAC. On the parallel side, we prove that average linkage HAC likely cannot be parallelized even on simple graphs by showing that it is CC-hard on trees of diameter $4$. On the possibility side, we demonstrate that average linkage HAC can be efficiently parallelized (i.e., it is in NC) on paths and can be solved in near-linear time when the height of the output cluster hierarchy is small.</description>

      <title>Beating the natural Grover bound for low-energy estimation and state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating ground state energies of many-body Hamiltonians is a central task in many areas of quantum physics. In this work, we give quantum algorithms which, given any $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$, compute an estimate for the ground state energy and prepare a quantum state achieving said energy, respectively. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, our algorithms return, with high probability, an estimate of the ground state energy of $H$ within additive error $\varepsilon M$, or a quantum state with the corresponding energy. Here, $M$ is the total strength of all interaction terms, which in general is extensive in the system size. Our approach makes no assumptions about the geometry or spatial locality of interaction terms of the input Hamiltonian and thus handles even long-range or all-to-all interactions, such as in quantum chemistry, where lattice-based techniques break down. In this fully general setting, the runtime of our algorithms scales as $2^{cn/2}$ for $c&lt;1$, yielding the first quantum algorithms for low-energy estimation breaking a standard square root Grover speedup for unstructured search. The core of our approach is remarkably simple, and relies on showing that an extensive fraction of the interactions can be neglected with a controlled error. What this ultimately implies is that even arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonians have structure in their low energy space, in the form of an exponential-dimensional low energy subspace.</description>
