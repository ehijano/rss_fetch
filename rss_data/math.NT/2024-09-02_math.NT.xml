      <title>Is there a group structure on the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a global field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let K be a global field, that is, a number field or a global function field. It is known that the answer to the question in the title over K is "Yes" when K has no real embeddings. We show that otherwise the answer is "No". Namely, we show that when K is a number field admitting a real embedding, it is impossible to define a group structure on the first Galois cohomology sets H^1(K,G) for all reductive K-groups G in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for solvability of linear Diophantine equations and Frobenius numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear Diophantine equation $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ix_i=b$ is considered, where $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ are coprime natural numbers, $b$ is an non-negative integer, $x_i$ $(i=1,2,...,n)$ are non-negative integers. It is proved that if $\left[\frac{b}{M}\right]\geq \left[n-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i+r}{M}\right]$, then this equation is solvable (here $M$ is the least common multiple of the numbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$; $r$ is the remainder of $b$ modulo $M$). With the aid of this result, it is shown that the considered equation is solvable if either $b\geq nM-\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$ or $b\geq (n-1)M$. The case where $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i\geq (n-2)M+2$ is considered closer. It is proved that, in that case, the equation is solvable if $b&gt;(n-1)M-\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$. If, in addition, $r&gt;(n-1)M-\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$, then it has $\frac{M^{n-1}}{a_1a_2...a_n}C^{n-1}_{b'+n-1}$ integer non-negative solutions; it is also shown that if $b\geq M$ and $r\leq (n-1)M-\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$, then the number of solutions of the equation is greater than or equal to $\frac{M^{n-1}}{a_1a_2...a_n}C^{n-1}_{b'+n-2}$; here $b'=\left[\frac{b}{M}\right]$ (and $C^{k}_{m}$ denotes the binomial coefficient ${\begin{pmatrix}m\\k\\\end{pmatrix}}$). Moreover, it is proved that if the numbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ are coprime, then $Frob(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)\leq c$, where $c$ is the smallest among the numbers $a_ia_j-a_i-a_j$ with $(a_i,a_j)=1$ ($1\leq i&lt; j\leq n$).</description>

      <title>On the Grothendieck resolution for a certain finite flat commutative group scheme of order $p^{n}$ over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any commutative finite flat group scheme, Grothendieck constructed an embedding into some smooth group scheme. This embedding is called the Grothendieck resolution. Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. We consider the Grothendieck resolution for a certain finite flat commutative group scheme of order $p^{n}$ over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Linear constellations in primes with arithmetic restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove analogues of the Green-Tao-Ziegler theorem on linear constellations in primes, in which the primes under consideration are restricted by certain arithmetic conditions. Our first main result is conditional upon Hooley's Riemann hypothesis and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed primitive roots. Our second main result is unconditional and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed Artin symbols in given Galois number fields. To illustrate this second result, we present an application in inverse Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Zero attractors of hook polynomials and related questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study zero attractors for polynomials built from partition statistics, complementing earlier work in this direction by Boyer, Goh, Parry, and others. In particular, using analytic methods we establish the zero attractor of partition $t$-hook polynomials for $t \geq 6$, addressing a question of Males with two of the authors. We also discuss some open problems and present data on other polynomial families, including those associated to deformations of Rogers--Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <title>On log-concavity of the number of orbits in commuting tuples of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $A(p, n, k)$ the number of commuting $p$-tuples of permutations on $[n]$ that have exactly $k$ distinct orbits. It was conjectured in~\cite{abdesselam2023log} that $A(p, n, k)$ is log-concave with respect to $k$ for every $p\geq 2, n\geq 3$, and the log-concavity was proved in ``$p=\infty$" case. In this paper, we prove that for $k=n-\alpha$, the log-concavity for $A(p, n, k)$ holds for every $p\geq 2$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Further Investigation on Differential Properties of the Generalized Ness-Helleseth Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an odd positive integer, $p$ be a prime with $p\equiv3\pmod4$, $d_{1} = {{p^{n}-1}\over {2}} -1 $ and $d_{2} =p^{n}-2$. The function defined by $f_u(x)=ux^{d_{1}}+x^{d_{2}}$ is called the generalized Ness-Helleseth function over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. It was initially studied by Ness and Helleseth in the ternary case. In this paper, for $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and $p^n \ge7$, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for $f_u(x)$ to be an APN function. In addition, for each $u$ satisfying $\chi(u+1) = \chi(u-1)$, the differential spectrum of $f_u(x)$ is investigated, and it is expressed in terms of some quadratic character sums of cubic polynomials, where $\chi(\cdot)$ denotes the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>Recent results on large gaps between primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the themes of this paper is recent results on large gaps between primes. The first of these results has been achieved in the paper [12] by Ford, Green, Konyagin and Tao. It was later improved in the joint paper [13] of these four authors with Maynard. One of the main ingredients of these results are old methods due to Erd\H{o}s and Rankin. Other ingredients are important breakthrough results due to Goldston, Pintz and Yildirim [15, 16, 17], and their extension by Maynard on small gaps between primes. All these previous results are discussed shortly. The results on the appearance of $k$-th powers of primes contained in those large gaps, obtained by the author in joint work with Maier [23, 24, 25] are based on a combination of the results just described with the matrix method of Maier.</description>

      <title>Additive number theory and the Dyson transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1942 Mann solved a famous problem, the $\alpha+\beta$ conjecture, about the lower bound of the Shnirel'man density of sums of sets of positive integers. In 1945, Dyson generalized Mann's theorem and obtained a lower bound for the Shnirel'man density of rank $r$ sumsets. His proof introduced the Dyson transform, an important tool in additive number theory. This paper explains the background of Dyson's work, gives Dyson's proof of his theorem, and includes several applications of the Dyson transform, such as Kneser's inequality for sums of finite subsets of an arbitrary additive abelian group.</description>

      <title>Shifted symplectic structures on derived analytic moduli of $\ell$-adic local systems and Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a characterisation of non-Archimedean derived analytic geometry based on dg enhancements of dagger algebras. This allows us to formulate derived analytic moduli functors for many types of pro-\'etale sheaves, and to construct shifted symplectic structures on them by transgression using arithmetic duality theorems. In order to handle duality functors involving Tate twists, we introduce weighted shifted symplectic structures on formal weighted moduli stacks, with the usual moduli stacks given by taking $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariants.
  In particular, this establishes the existence of shifted symplectic and Lagrangian structures on derived moduli stacks of $\ell$-adic constructible complexes on smooth varieties via Poincar\'e duality, and on derived moduli stacks of $\ell$-adic Galois representations via Tate and Poitou--Tate duality; the latter proves a conjecture of Minhyong Kim.
  Unweighted shifted symplectic and Lagrangian structures are also established for $\ell$-adic Galois representations of cyclotomic fields $K(\mu_{\ell^{\infty}})$, subject to additional constraints related to Iwasawa theory; these derived moduli stacks yield a non-abelian analogue of Selmer complexes, with $0$-shifted symplectic structures related to generalised Cassels--Tate pairings.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku [17],we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Second adjointness and cuspidal supports at the categorical level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the second adjointness in the setting of the categorical local Langlands correspondence. Moreover, we study the relation between Eisenstein series and cuspidal supports and present a conjectural characterization of irreducible smooth representations with supercuspidal $L$-parameters regarding geometric constant terms. The main technical ingredient is an induction principle for geometric Eisenstein series which allows us to reduce to the situations already treated in the literature.</description>
