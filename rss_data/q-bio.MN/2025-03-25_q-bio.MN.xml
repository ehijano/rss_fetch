      <title>GRiNS: A Python Library for Simulating Gene Regulatory Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks govern various cellular processes. However, understanding these dynamics is challenging due to the difficulty of parameterizing the computational models for these networks, especially as the network size increases. Here, we introduce a simulation library, Gene Regulatory Interaction Network Simulator (GRiNS), to address these challenges. GRiNS integrates popular parameter-agnostic simulation frameworks, RACIPE and Boolean Ising formalism, into a single Python library capable of leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient and scalable simulations. GRiNS extends the ordinary differential equations (ODE) based RACIPE framework with a more modular design, allowing users to choose parameters, initial conditions, and time-series outputs for greater customisability and accuracy in simulations. For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks. The documentation and installation instructions for GRiNS can be found at https://moltenecdysone09.github.io/GRiNS/.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRN) comprise an important class of models to understand biological functions such as cellular information processing, the robustness and control of metabolic pathways, circadian rhythms, and many more. However, any CRN describing a certain function does not act in isolation but is a part of a much larger network and as such is constantly subject to external changes. In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. "Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks." SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all concentrations within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivities. As the main technical tool, a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound for CRN is proven, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions. This leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN. As an example, the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system is analyzed analytically and numerically by extensive random sampling of the concentration space. The experimentally known findings for the robustness of the IDH enzyme are confirmed and a hidden symmetry at the level of distributions is revealed, providing a blueprint for the analysis of the robustness properties of CRNs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</description>

      <title>Noise equals endogenous control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>
