      <description>arXiv:2410.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the rather large literature concerning the regularity of the solution of the standard normal Stein equation, we provide a complete description of the best possible uniform bounds for the derivatives of the solution of the standard normal Stein equation when the test functions belong to the class of real-valued functions whose $k$-th order derivative is Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviors for Volterra type McKean-Vlasov stochastic integral equations with small noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to studying asymptotic behaviors for Volterra type McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with small noise. By applying the weak convergence approach, we establish the large and moderate deviation principles. In addition, we obtain the central limit theorem and find the Volterra integral equation satisfied by the limiting process, which involves the Lions derivative of the drift coefficient.</description>

      <title>On the local convergence of integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees. It was shown by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff that such functions are localized, however, finer questions about the structure of Gibbs measures remain unanswered. Our main result is that the weak limit of a uniformly chosen 1-Lipschitz function with 0 boundary condition on a $d$-ary tree of height $n$ exists as $n \to \infty$ if $2 \le d \le 7$, but not if $d \ge 8$, thereby partially answering a question posed by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff. For large $d$, the value at the root alternates between being almost entirely concentrated on 0 for even $n$ and being roughly uniform on $\{-1,0,1\}$ for odd $n$, leading to different limits as $n$ approaches infinity along evens or odds. For $d \ge 8$, the essence of this phenomenon is preserved, which obstructs the convergence. For $d \le 7$, this phenomenon ceases to exist, and the law of the value at the root loses its connection with the parity of $n$. Along the way, we also obtain an alternative proof of localization. The key idea is a fixed point convergence result for a related operator on $\ell^\infty$, and a procedure to show that the iterations get into a `basin of attraction' of the fixed point. We also prove some accompanying analogous `even-odd phenomenon' type results about $M$-lipschitz functions on general non-amenable graphs with high enough expansion (this includes for example the large $d$ case for regular trees). We also prove a convergence result for 1-Lipschitz functions with $\{0,1\}$ boundary condition. This last result relies on an absolute value FKG for uniform 1-Lipschitz functions when shifted by $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Simple Relative Deviation Bounds for Covariance and Gram Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

      <title>Conditioned random walks on linear groups I: construction of the target harmonic measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective is to explore random walks on the general linear group, constrained to a specific domain, with a primary focus on establishing the conditioned local limit theorem. This paper marks the initial stride toward achieving this goal, specifically entailing the construction of a novel entity -- the target harmonic measure. This measure, together with the harmonic function, serves as a pivotal component in shaping the conditioned local limit theorem. Using a reversal identity, we introduce a reversed sequence characterized as a dual random walk with a perturbation depending on future observations. The investigation of such walks, which rely on future information, lies at the heart of this paper. To carry out this study, we develop an approach grounded in the finite-size approximation of perturbations, enabling us to simplify the investigation to an array of Markov chains with increasing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Limit theory for the first layers of the random convex hull peeling in a simple polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convex hull peeling of a point set consists in taking the convex hull, then removing the extreme points and iterating that procedure until no point remains. The boundary of each hull is called a layer. Following on from [15], we study the first layers generated by the peeling procedure when the point set is chosen as a homogeneous Poisson point process inside a polytope when the intensity goes to infinity. We focus on some specific functionals, namely the number of k-dimensional faces and the outer defect volume. Since the early works of R{\'e}nyi and Sulanke, it is well known that both the techniques and the rates are completely different for the convex hull when the underlying convex body has a smooth boundary or when it is itself a polytope. We expect such dichotomy to extend to the further layers of the peeling. More precisely we provide asymptotic limits for their expectation and variance as well as a central limit theorem. In particular, as in the unit ball, the growth rates do not depend on the layer. The method builds upon previous constructions for the convex hull contained in [9] and [18] and requires the assumption that the underlying polytope is simple.</description>

      <title>Conditioned random walks on linear groups II: local limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate random walks on the general linear group constrained within a specific domain, with a focus on their asymptotic behavior. In a previous work [21], we constructed the associated harmonic measure, a key element in formulating the local limit theorem for conditioned random walks on groups. The primary aim of this paper is to prove this theorem. The main challenge arises from studying the conditioned reverse walk, whose increments, in the context of random walks on groups, depend on the entire future. To achieve our goal, we combine a Caravenna-type conditioned local limit theorem with the conditioned version of the central limit theorem for the reversed walk. The resulting local limit theorem is then applied to derive the local behavior of the exit time.</description>

      <title>Slepian model based independent interval approximation for the level excursion distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving properties of excursion time distributions of stochastic processes is vital in many fields, such as physics and engineering. However, obtaining analytical results is difficult for most processes. A common approximation method in physics is the so-called independent interval approximation (IIA), which matches the covariance of a clipped Gaussian process to the covariance of a stationary binary process. We recently proposed a new method based on the Slepian process, which models a process behavior at the crossing instant for approximating zero-level crossings. This approach matches the expected value of the clipped Slepian to the expected value of a non-stationary binary stochastic process called a switch process. This work extends this approach to non-zero crossings and provides a probabilistic foundation for the validity of the approximations for a large class of processes. Both the above and below distributions are approximated. While the Slepian-based method was shown to be equivalent to the classical IIA for the zero-level, this is not the case for non-zero crossings.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit for additive functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by models for synchronous spiking activity in neuroscience,
  we consider a scaling-limit framework for sequences of strong Markov
  processes. Within this framework, we establish the convergence of
  certain additive functionals toward L\'evy subordinators, which are
  of interest in synchronous input drive modeling in neuronal models.
  After proving an abstract theorem in full generality, we provide
  detailed and explicit conclusions in the case of reflected
  one-dimensional diffusions. Specializing even further, we provide an
  in-depth analysis of the limiting behavior of a sequence of
  integrated Wright-Fisher diffusions. In neuroscience, such
  diffusions serve to parametrize synchrony in doubly-stochastic
  models of spiking activity. Additional explicit examples involving
  the Feller diffusion and the Brownian motion with drift are also
  given.</description>

      <title>Universality for roots of derivatives of entire functions via finite free probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universality conjecture of Farmer and Rhoades [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 357(9):3789--3811, 2005] and Farmer [Adv. Math., 411:Paper No. 108781, 14, 2022] asserts that, under some natural conditions, the roots of an entire function should become perfectly spaced in the limit of repeated differentiation. This conjecture is known as Cosine Universality. We establish this conjecture for a class of even entire functions with only real roots which are real on the real line. Along the way, we establish a number of additional universality results for Jensen polynomials of entire functions, including the Hermite Universality conjecture of Farmer [Adv. Math., 411:Paper No. 108781, 14, 2022]. Our proofs are based on finite free probability theory. We establish finite free probability analogs of the law of large numbers, central limit theorem, and Poisson limit theorem for sequences of deterministic polynomials under repeated differentiation, under optimal moment conditions, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics and the sub-limit at $L^{2}$-criticality of higher moments for the SHE in dimension $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $d$-dimensional mollified stochastic heat equation (SHE) when the mollification parameter is turned off. Here, we concentrate on the high-dimensional case $d \geq 3$. Recently, the limiting higher moments of the two-dimensional mollified SHE have been established. However, this problem in high dimensions remains unexplored to date. The main theorems of this article aim to answer this question and prove some related properties: (1) Our first main result, based on the spectral theorem for the unbounded operator, proves the divergence of the higher moments of the high-dimensional mollified SHE even when the system is strictly inside the $L^{2}$-regime. This phenomenon is completely opposite to its two-dimensional counterpart; (2) To further differentiate the nature of the high-dimensional case from the case in two dimensions, our second main result proves the unboundedness of the sub-limiting higher moments of the three-dimensional mollified SHE at the $L^{2}$-criticality. Here, the sub-limiting higher moment is a natural limit of the higher moment of the three-dimensional mollified SHE at the $L^{2}$-criticality; (3) As an application, we provide partial results for the conjecture about the high-order critical regimes of the continuous directed polymer. The other byproduct of the above results gives a proper estimate for the critical exponent of the polymer in the $L^{2}$-regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we analyze the performance of a simple root-finding algorithm in uniform attachment trees. The leaf-stripping algorithm recursively removes all leaves of the tree for a carefully chosen number of rounds. We show that, with probability $1 - \epsilon$, the set of remaining vertices contains the root and has a size only depending on $\epsilon$ but not on the size of the tree.</description>

      <title>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in [0,1], \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on ${\mathbb R}_+\times[0,1]$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p({\mathbb R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <title>An epidemic model on a network having two group structures with tunable overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network epidemic model is studied. The underlying social network has two different types of group structures, households and workplaces, such that each individual belongs to exactly one household and one workplace. The random network is constructed such that a parameter $\theta$ controls the degree of overlap between the two group structures: $\theta=0$ corresponding to all household members belonging to the same workplace and $\theta=1$ to all household members belonging to distinct workplaces. On the network a stochastic SIR epidemic is defined, having an arbitrary but specified infectious period distribution, with global (community), household and workplace infectious contacts. The stochastic epidemic model is analysed as the population size $n\to\infty$ with the (asymptotic) probability, and size, of a major outbreak obtained. These results are proved in greater generality than existing results in the literature by allowing for any fixed $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$, a non-constant infectious period distribution, the presence or absence of global infection and potentially (asymptotically) infinite local outbreaks.</description>

Abstract: Statistical mechanics explains the properties of macroscopic phenomena based on the movements of microscopic particles such as atoms and molecules. Movements of microscopic particles can be represented by large-scale interacting systems. In this article, we study a combinatorial object which we call interactions, given as a symmetric directed graph representing the possible transition of states on adjacent sites of large-scale interacting systems. Such interactions underlie various standard processes such as the exclusion processes, generalized exclusion processes, multi-species exclusion processes, lattice-gas processes with energy, and the multi-lane particle processes. We introduce the notion of equivalences of interactions using their space of conserved quantities. This allows for the classification of interactions reflecting corresponding macroscopic properties. In particular, we prove that when the set of local states consists of two, three or four elements, then the number of equivalence classes of separable interactions are respectively one, two and five. We also define the wedge sums and box products of interactions, which give systematic methods for constructing new interactions from existing ones. Furthermore, we prove that the irreducibly quantified condition for interactions, which has implicitly played an important role in the theory of hydrodynamic limits, is preserved by wedge sums and box products. Our results provide a systematic method to construct and classify interactions, offering abundant examples suitable for considering hydrodynamic limits.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>A Random-Walk Concentration Principle for Occupancy Processes on Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns discrete-time occupancy processes on a finite graph. Our results can be formulated in two theorems, which are stated for vertex processes, but also applied to edge process (e.g., dynamic random graphs). The first theorem shows that concentration of local state averages is controlled by a random walk on the graph. The second theorem concerns concentration of polynomials of the vertex states. For dynamic random graphs, this allows to estimate deviations of edge density, triangle density, and more general subgraph densities. Our results only require Lipschitz continuity and hold for both dense and sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Cusp Universality for Correlated Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For correlated real symmetric or complex Hermitian random matrices, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics at any cusp singularity are universal. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root edge or cubic root cusp singularities, our result completes the proof of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture in all spectral regimes for a very general class of random matrices. Previously only the bulk and the edge universality were established in this generality [arXiv:1804.07744], while cusp universality was proven only for Wigner-type matrices with independent entries [arXiv:1809.03971, arXiv:1811.04055]. As our main technical input, we prove an optimal local law at the cusp using the Zigzag strategy, a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and a Green function comparison argument. Moreover, our proof of the optimal local law holds uniformly in the spectrum, thus also re-establishing universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the previously studied bulk [arXiv:1705.10661] and edge [arXiv:1804.07744] regimes.</description>

Abstract: We give explicit formulas and asymptotics for the distribution of the index of the Brownian loop in the following geometrical settings: the complex projective line from which two points have been removed; the complex hyperbolic line from which one point has been removed; the odd dimensional spheres from which a great hypersphere has been removed; and the complex anti-de Sitter spaces. Our analysis is based on the geometry of the Hopf and anti-de Sitter fibrations, and on the relationship between winding and area forms.</description>

      <title>Mixing of the No-U-Turn Sampler and the Geometry of Gaussian Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the mixing time of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), when initialized in the concentration region of the canonical Gaussian measure, scales as $d^{1/4}$, up to logarithmic factors, where $d$ is the dimension. This scaling is expected to be sharp. This result is based on a coupling argument that leverages the geometric structure of the target distribution. Specifically, concentration of measure results in a striking uniformity in NUTS' locally adapted transitions, which holds with high probability. This uniformity is formalized by interpreting NUTS as an accept/reject Markov chain, where the mixing properties for the more uniform accept chain are analytically tractable. Additionally, our analysis uncovers a previously unnoticed issue with the path length adaptation procedure of NUTS, specifically related to looping behavior, which we address in detail.</description>

      <title>Gaussian to log-normal transition for independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs, i.e., subsets of vertices where no two are adjacent, have long been studied, for instance as a model of hard-core gas. The $d$-dimensional hypercube, $\{0,1\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure, has been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to its many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko who proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure theorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior of such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction, Kronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond percolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics they obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition function, say $\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and consequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series of interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that there is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ transitions from being concentrated for $p&gt;2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.
  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on certain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of both the fluctuations of $\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly sampled independent set. In particular, we establish that $\mathcal{Z}$, properly centered and scaled, converges to a standard Gaussian for $p&gt;2/3$, and to a sum of two i.i.d. log-normals at $p=2/3$. A particular step in the proof which could be of independent interest involves a non-uniform birthday problem for which collisions emerge at $p=2/3$.</description>

      <title>A Law of Large Numbers for SIR on the Stochastic Block Model: A Proof via Herd Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on a network with community structure, namely the stochastic block model (SBM). As usual, the SIR model is a stochastic model for an epidemic where infected vertices infect susceptible neighbors at some rate $\eta$ and recover at rate $\gamma$, and the SBM is a random graph model where vertices are partitioned into a finite number of communities. The connection probability between two vertices depends on their community affiliation, here scaled so that the average degrees have a finite limit as the network grows. We prove laws of large numbers (LLN) for the epidemic's trajectory to a system of ordinary differential equations over any time horizon (finite or infinite), including in particular a LLN for the final size of the infection.
  Our proofs rely on two main ingredients: (i) a new coupling of the SIR epidemic and the randomness of the SBM, revealing a vector-valued random variable that drives the epidemic (related to what is usually called the ``force of the infection'' via a linear transformation), and (ii) a novel technique for analyzing the limiting behavior of the infinite time horizon for the infection, using the fact that once the infection passes the herd immunity threshold it dies out quickly and has a negligible impact on the overall size of the infection.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the independence number of $ G_{n,m}$ is concentrated on two values for $ n^{5/4+ \epsilon} &lt; m \le \binom{n}{2}$. This result establishes a distinction between $G_{n,m}$ and $G_{n,p}$ with $p = m/ \binom{n}{2}$ in the regime $ n^{5/4 + \epsilon} &lt; m&lt; n^{4/3}$. In this regime the independence number of $ G_{n,m}$ is concentrated on two values while the independence number of $ G_{n,p}$ is not; indeed, for $p$ in this regime variations in $ \alpha( G_{n,p})$ are determined by variations in the number of edges in $ G_{n,p}$.</description>

      <title>Exact sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes via algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for deterministic sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes, commonly used in cost-effectiveness analyses, via reformulation into a polynomial system. Our approach leverages cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), a technique arising from algebraic geometry that provides an exact description of all solutions to a polynomial system. While it is typically intractable to build a CAD for systems with more than a few variables, we show that a special class of polynomial systems, which includes the polynomials arising from Markov reward processes, can be analyzed much more tractably. We establish several theoretical results about such systems and develop a specialized algorithm to construct their CAD, which allows us to perform exact, multi-way sensitivity analysis for common health economic analyses. We develop an open-source software package that implements our algorithm. Finally, we apply it to two case studies, one with synthetic data and one that re-analyzes a previous cost-effectiveness analysis from the literature, demonstrating advantages of our approach over standard techniques. Our software and code are available at: \url{https://github.com/mmaaz-git/markovag}.</description>

      <title>lintsampler: Easy random sampling via linear interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 'lintsampler' provides a Python implementation of a technique we term 'linear interpolant sampling': an algorithm to efficiently draw pseudo-random samples from an arbitrary probability density function (PDF). First, the PDF is evaluated on a grid-like structure. Then, it is assumed that the PDF can be approximated between grid vertices by the (multidimensional) linear interpolant. With this assumption, random samples can be efficiently drawn via inverse transform sampling. lintsampler is primarily written with 'numpy', drawing some additional functionality from 'scipy'. Under the most basic usage of lintsampler, the user provides a Python function defining the target PDF and some parameters describing a grid-like structure to the 'LintSampler' class, and is then able to draw samples via the 'sample' method. Additionally, there is functionality for the user to set the random seed, employ quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, or sample within a premade grid ('DensityGrid') or tree ('DensityTree') structure.</description>

      <title>Uniform Convergence Rate of the Nonparametric Estimator for Integrated Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonparametric estimation of integrated diffusion processes has been thoroughly studied, primarily focusing on point-wise convergence. This paper firstly obtains the uniform convergence rates of the Nadaraya-Watson estimators for the coefficients of the integrated diffusion processes. We derive the uniform convergence rates over unbounded support under the shrinking observation interval and long time span assumption. While existing literature suggests that the convergence rate for the diffusion coefficient estimator in continuous-time diffusion processes can reach $(\log n/n)^{2/5}$, which corresponds to the minimax lower bound in sup-norm risk for nonparametric estimation with i.i.d. data. However, we find that the diffusion coefficient estimator of integrated diffusion processes can not attain this rate. Our results are necessary tools for specification testing and semiparametric estimation of certain types of diffusion processes and time series, based on nonparametric estimators, with applications in fields such as finance, geology, and physics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the first passage time beyond a barrier located at $b\geq0$ of a random walk with independent and identically distributed jumps, starting from $x_0=0$. The walk is subject to stochastic resetting, meaning that after each step the evolution is restarted with fixed probability $r$. We consider a resetting protocol that is an intermediate situation between a random walk ($r=0$) and an uncorrelated sequence of jumps all starting from the origin ($r=1$), and derive a general condition for determining when restarting the process with $0&lt;r&lt;1$ is more efficient than restarting after each jump. If the mean first passage time of the process in absence of resetting is larger than that of the sequence of jumps, this condition is sufficient to establish the existence of an optimal $0&lt;r^*&lt;1$ that represents the best strategy, outperforming both $r=0$ and $r=1$. Our findings are discussed by considering two important examples of jump processes, for which we draw the phase diagram illustrating the regions of the parameter space where resetting with some $0&lt;r^*&lt;1$ is optimal.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive a summation formula for the alternating infinite series and an expression for zeta function by using hyperbolic secant random variables. These identities involve Euler numbers and are obtained by computing the moments of the random variable and the moments of the sum of two independent such random variables.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximations of the Stochastic linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and derive an error estimate with respect to the discretization parameter of the finite element approximation.

      <description>arXiv:2410.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining ideas of Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin on spread perfect matchings in super-regular bipartite graphs with an algorithmic blow-up lemma, we prove a spread version of the blow-up lemma. Intuitively, this means that there exists a probability measure over copies of a desired spanning graph $H$ in a given system of super-regular pairs which does not heavily pin down any subset of vertices. This allows one to complement the use of the blow-up lemma with the recently resolved Kahn-Kalai conjecture. As an application, we prove an approximate version of a conjecture of B\"ottcher, Parczyk, Sgueglia, and Skokan on the threshold for appearance of powers of Hamilton cycles in perturbed random graphs.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control is Almost Optimal for Restless Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete time infinite horizon average reward restless markovian bandit (RMAB) problem. We propose a \emph{model predictive control} based non-stationary policy with a rolling computational horizon $\tau$. At each time-slot, this policy solves a $\tau$ horizon linear program whose first control value is kept as a control for the RMAB. Our solution requires minimal assumptions and quantifies the loss in optimality in terms of $\tau$ and the number of arms, $N$. We show that its sub-optimality gap is $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in general, and $\exp(-\Omega(N))$ under a local-stability condition. Our proof is based on a framework from dynamic control known as \emph{dissipativity}. Our solution easy to implement and performs very well in practice when compared to the state of the art. Further, both our solution and our proof methodology can easily be generalized to more general constrained MDP settings and should thus, be of great interest to the burgeoning RMAB community.</description>

      <title>Backbone exponent and annulus crossing probability for planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the recent derivation of the backbone exponent for 2D percolation. In contrast to previously known exactly solved percolation exponents, the backbone exponent is a transcendental number, which is a root of an elementary equation. We also report an exact formula for the probability that there are two disjoint paths of the same color crossing an annulus. The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Our approach is based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), and the integrability of Liouville CFT that governs the LQG surfaces.</description>

Abstract: The edge space $\mathcal{E}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^{E(G)}$ with members naturally identified with subgraphs of $G$, and the $H$-space is the subspace $\mathcal{C}_H(G)$ of $ \mathcal{E}(G)$ spanned by copies of the graph $H$. We are interested in when the random graph $G = G_{n,p}$ is likely to satisfy \[\mathcal{C}_H(G) = \mathcal{W}_H(G),\] where $\mathcal{W}_H(G)$ takes one of four natural values, depending on the value of $\mathcal{C}_H(K_n)$. We show that for strictly $2$-balanced $H$, w.h.p. the above equality holds whenever every edge of $G$ is in a copy of $H$.</description>

      <title>Complete pivoting growth of butterfly matrices and butterfly Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth problem in Gaussian elimination (GE) remains a foundational question in numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra. Wilkinson resolved the growth problem in GE with partial pivoting (GEPP) in his initial analysis from the 1960s, while he was only able to establish an upper bound for the GE with complete pivoting (GECP) growth problem. The GECP growth problem has seen a spike in recent interest, culminating in improved lower and upper bounds established by Bisain, Edelman, and Urschel in 2023, but still remains far from being fully resolved. Due to the complex dynamics governing the location of GECP pivots, analysis of GECP growth for particular input matrices often estimates the actual growth rather than computes the growth exactly. We present a class of dense random butterfly matrices on which we can present the exact GECP growth. We extend previous results that established exact growth computations for butterfly matrices when using GEPP and GE with rook pivoting (GERP) to now also include GECP for particular input matrices. Moreover, we present a new method to construct random Hadamard matrices using butterfly matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that every $n\times n$ bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\|A\|_{F}^2\leq \max_{\sigma\in S_n}A_{i,\sigma(i)}$ where $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices for which the equality holds in the Marcus-Ree inequality. We refer to such matrices as Erd\H{o}s matrices. While this problem is trivial in dimension $n=2$, the case of dimension $n=3$ was resolved in~\cite{bouthat2024question} in 2023. We prove that for every $n$, there are only finitely many $n\times n$ Erd\H{o}s matrices. We also give a characterization of Erd\H{o}s matrices that yields an algorithm to generate all Erd\H{o}s matrices in any given dimension. We also prove that Erd\H{o}s matrices can have only rational entries. This answers a question of~\cite{bouthat2024question}.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite width two layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron model we show that, depending on the value of the margin and the constrained density, there is a line separating a phase in which the distribution of overlaps of typical states does not possess a gap from one in which it does. Our results show that the hypothesis underlying some recently developed theorems claiming that Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms are able to reach capacity, does not hold in general. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity both in cases where there is and there is not a non-overlap gap phase for the typical states. This, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

Abstract: We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for functionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained to the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal law. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartlsensitivityadapted} by introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with respect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit characterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging strategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>On the long-time statistical behavior of smooth solutions of the weakly damped, stochastically-driven KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the damped periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of a white-in-time and spatially smooth stochastic source term and studies the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the integrals of motion for KdV can be exploited to prove regularity and ergodic properties of invariant measures for damped stochastic KdV. First, by considering non-trivial modifications of the integrals of motion, we establish Lyapunov structure by proving that moments of Sobolev norms of solutions at all orders of regularity are bounded globally-in-time; existence of invariant measures follows as an immediate consequence. Next, we prove a weak Foias-Prodi type estimate for damped stochastic KdV, for which the synchronization occurs in expected value. This estimate plays a crucial role throughout our subsequent analysis. As a first novel application, we combine the Foias-Prodi estimate with the Lyapunov structure to establish that invariant measures are supported on smooth functions provided that the external driving forces are smooth. We then establish ergodic properties of invariant measures, treating the regimes of arbitrary damping and large damping separately. For arbitrary damping, we demonstrate that the framework of `asymptotic coupling' can be implemented for a compact proof of uniqueness of the invariant measure provided that sufficiently many directions in phase space are stochastically forced. Our proof is paradigmatic for SPDEs for which a weak Foias-Prodi type property holds. Lastly, for large damping, we establish the existence of a spectral gap with respect to a Wasserstein-like distance, and exponential mixing and uniqueness of the invariant measure follows.</description>

This includes results for deterministic partial differential equations. As an example, we will consider the situation where the subset is a finite dimensional submanifold with boundary. We also discuss applications to mathematical finance, namely the modeling of the evolution of interest rate curves.</description>

Abstract: We reduce the local limit theorem for a non-compact semisimple Lie group acting on its symmetric space to establishing that a natural operator associated to the measure is quasicompact. Under strong Diophantine assumptions on the underlying measure, we deduce the necessary spectral results for the operator in question. We thereby give the first examples of finitely supported measures satisfying such a local limit theorem. Moreover, quantitative error rates for the local limit theorem are proved under additional assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.</description>

      <title>Independent projections of diffusions: Gradient flows for variational inference and optimal mean field approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the optimal way to approximate a high-dimensional diffusion process by one in which the coordinates are independent? This paper presents a construction, called the \emph{independent projection}, which is optimal for two natural criteria. First, when the original diffusion is reversible with invariant measure $\rho_*$, the independent projection serves as the Wasserstein gradient flow for the relative entropy $H(\cdot\,|\,\rho_*)$ constrained to the space of product measures. This is related to recent Langevin-based sampling schemes proposed in the statistical literature on mean field variational inference. In addition, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the long-time convergence of the independent projection, with quantitative results in the log-concave case derived via a new variant of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Second, among all processes with independent coordinates, the independent projection is shown to exhibit the slowest growth rate of path-space entropy relative to the original diffusion. This sheds new light on the classical McKean-Vlasov equation and recent variants proposed for non-exchangeable systems, which can be viewed as special cases of the independent projection.</description>

In this paper, we study an extension of this model by making the temperature and the distance between interfaces goes to infinity. We give a full phase diagram for this model, and show that a new behaviour appears in this extension. Our key tool include new sharp results on the simple random walk evolving between interfaces.</description>

      <title>Hitting probability for Reflected Brownian Motion at Small Target</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic behavior of hitting probability at small target of size $O(\epsilon)$ for reflected Brownian motion in domains with suitable smooth boundary conditions, where the boundary of domain contains both reflecting part, absorbing part and target. In this case the domain could be localized near the target and explicit computations are possible. The asymptotic behavior is only related to $\epsilon$ up to some multiplicative constants that depends on the domain and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the space-time fluctuations of the SHE and KPZ equation in the entire $L^{2}$-regime for spatial dimensions $d \geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the mollified stochastic heat equation with flat initial data and the corresponding Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in dimension $d \geq 3$ when the mollification parameter is turned off. In addition, we assume that the strength of the space-time white noise is small enough, such that the solution of the mollified stochastic heat equation has a finite limiting second moment. In this case, with regard to the mollified KPZ equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified KPZ equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional distributions towards a Gaussian free field. On the other hand, about the mollified stochastic heat equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified stochastic heat equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional convergence towards the product of an i.i.d random field and an independent Gaussian free field. Here the i.i.d random field is generated by the limiting partition function of the continuous directed polymer. As an application, we prove the limiting fluctuations of the partition function and the free energy of the continuous directed polymer.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular sign measure.</description>

      <title>Backward Map for Filter Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a backward map is introduced for the purposes of analysis of the nonlinear (stochastic) filter stability. The backward map is important because the filter-stability in the sense of $\chisq$-divergence follows from showing a certain variance decay property for the backward map. To show this property requires additional assumptions on the model properties of the hidden Markov model (HMM). The analysis in this paper is based on introducing a Poincar\'e Inequality (PI) for HMMs with white noise observations. In finite state-space settings, PI is related to both the ergodicity of the Markov process as well as the observability of the HMM. It is shown that the Poincar\'e constant is positive if and only if the HMM is detectable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $1946$, Mark Kac proved a Central Limit type theorem for a sequence of random variables that were not independent. The random variables under consideration were obtained from the angle-doubling map. The idea behind Kac's proof was to show that although the random variables under consideration were not independent, they were what he calls \textit{statistically independent} (in modern terminology, this concept is called long range independence). The final conclusion of his paper was that the sample averages of the random variables, suitably normalized converges to the standard normal distribution. We describe a new proof of Mark Kac's result by applying Stein's method and show that the normalized sample averages converge to the standard normal distribution in the Wasserstein metric, which is stronger than the convergence in distribution.</description>

      <title>The Monge-Kantorovich problem on Wasserstein space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Monge-Kantorovich problem between two random measuress. More precisely, given probability measures $\mathbb{P}_1,\mathbb{P}_2\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(M))$ on the space $\mathcal{P}(M)$ of probability measures on a smooth compact manifold, we study the optimal transport problem between $\mathbb{P}_1$ and $\mathbb{P}_2 $ where the cost function is given by the squared Wasserstein distance $W_2^2(\mu,\nu)$ between $\mu,\nu \in \mathcal{P}(M)$. Under appropriate assumptions on $\mathbb{P}_1$, we prove that there exists a unique optimal plan and that it takes the form of an optimal map. An extension of this result to cost functions of the form $h(W_2(\mu,\nu))$, for strictly convex and strictly increasing functions $h$, is also established. The proofs rely heavily on a recent result of Schiavo \cite{schiavo2020rademacher}, which establishes a version of Rademacher's theorem on Wasserstein space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(Y_n)_n$ be a sequence of $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variables. Suppose that the generating function \[f(x, z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \varphi_{Y_n}(x) z^n,\] where $\varphi_{Y_n}$ is the characteristic function of $Y_n$, extends to a function on a neighborhood of $\{0\} \times \{z : |z| \leq 1\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{C}$ which is meromorphic in $z$ and has no zeroes. We prove that if $1 / f(x, z)$ is twice differentiable, then there exists a constant $\mu$ such that the distribution of $(Y_n - \mu n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges weakly to a normal distribution as $n \to \infty$.
  If $Y_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$, where $(X_n)_n$ are i.i.d. random variables, then we recover the classical (Lindeberg$\unicode{x2013}$L\'evy) central limit theorem. We also prove the 2020 conjecture of Defant that if $\pi_n \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ is a uniformly random permutation, then the distribution of $(\operatorname{des} (s(\pi_n)) + 1 - (3 - e) n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a normal distribution with variance $2 + 2e - e^2$.</description>

      <title>Concentration and mean field approximation results for Markov processes on large networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Markov processes on weighted directed hypergraphs where the state of at most one vertex can change at a time. Our setting is general enough to include simplicial epidemic processes, processes on multilayered networks or even the dynamics of the edges of a graph.
  Our results are twofold. Firstly, we prove concentration bounds for the number of vertices in a certain state under mild assumptions. Our results imply that even the empirical averages of subpopulations of diverging but possibly sublinear size are well concentrated around their mean. In the case of undirected weighted graphs, we completely characterize when said averages concentrate around their expected value.
  Secondly, we prove (under assumptions which are tight in some significant cases) upper bounds for the error of the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA). In particular, for symmetric unweighted graphs, the error has the same order of magnitude as the reciprocal of the average degree, improving the previously known state of the art bound of the inverse square root of the average degree.</description>

Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>The KPZ Fixed Point and the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term 'KPZ' stands for the initials of three physicists, namely Kardar, Parisi and Zhang, which, in 1986 conjectured the existence of universal scaling behaviours for many random growth processes in the plane. A process is said to belong to the KPZ universality class if one can associate to it an appropriate 'height function' and show that its 3:2:1 (time : space: fluctuation) scaling limit, see 1.2, converges to a universal random process, the KPZ fixed point. Alternatively, membership is loosely characterised by having: 1. Local dynamics; 2. A smoothing mechanism; 3. Slope-dependent growth rate (lateral growth); 4. Space-time random forcing with the rapid decay of correlations.
  The central object that we will study is the so-called KPZ fixed point, which belongs to the KPZ universality class. Many strides have been made in the last couple of decades in this field, with constructions of the KPZ fixed point from certain processes such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (with arbitrary initial condition) and Brownian last passage percolation.
  In this article, we: 1. delineate the origins of KPZ universality; 2. describe and motivate canonical models; 3. give an overview of recent developments, especially those in the 2018 Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virag (DOV) paper; 4. present the strategy of and key points in the proof of the absolute continuity result of the KPZ fixed point by Sarkar and Virag; 5. conclude with remarks for future directions. The presentation is such that the content is displayed in a way that is as self-contained as possible and aimed at a motivated audience that has mastered the fundamentals of the theory of probability.</description>

      <title>A remarkable example on clustering of extremes for regularly-varying stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable-regenerative multiple-stable model has been shown recently to have distinct candidate extremal index and extremal index. To understand further this rare phenomenon, two more results are established here for the double-stable model. The first is the convergence of point processes for the clusters of extremes, enhancing the previous result on the weak convergence of random sup-measures. Most interestingly, the second result reveals a new phase transition at the mesoscopic level when computing the asymptotic exceedance probability over a block, $\mathbb P(\max_{k=1,\dots,d_n} X_k&gt;b_n)$, as $n\to\infty$. Here, the mesoscopic level is referred to the fact that the block size $d_n$ is allowed to grow at the rate $n^\rho$ with $\rho\in[0,1]$, while the threshold $b_n$ is such that $\mathbb P(X_1&gt;b_n)\sim 1/n$. The recently discovered discrepancy between the candidate extremal index and the extremal index is shown to be just a reflection of this phase transition that is prohibited by the anticlustering condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pathwise large deviation principle in the Wasserstein topology and a pathwise central limit theorem are proved for the empirical measure of a mean-field system of interacting diffusions. The coefficients are path-dependent. The framework allows for degenerate diffusion matrices, which may depend on the empirical measure, including mean-field kinetic processes. The main tool is an extension of Tanaka's pathwise construction to non-constant diffusion matrices. This can be seen as a mean-field analogous of Azencott's quasi-continuity method for the Freidlin-Wentzell theory. As a by-product, uniform-in-time-step fluctuation and large deviation estimates are proved for a discrete-time version of the meanfield system. Uniform-in-time-step convergence is also proved for the value function of some mean-field control problems with quadratic cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13860v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Tsallis entropic regularized optimal transport in the continuous setting and establish fundamental results such as the $\Gamma$-convergence of the Tsallis regularized optimal transport to the Monge--Kantorovich problem as the regularization parameter tends to zero. In addition, using the quantization and shadow arguments developed by Eckstein--Nutz, we derive the convergence rate of the Tsallis entropic regularization and provide explicit constants. Furthermore, we compare these results with the well-known case of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and show that the KL regularization achieves the fastest convergence rate in the Tsallis framework.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>What is the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent? A large deviations analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09241</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand which regions of the problem's state space are more likely to be visited by SGD, and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature equal to the method's step-size and energy levels determined by the problem's objective and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Conformal Prediction with Approximate Conditional Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method for generating prediction sets that combines the flexibility of conformal methods with an estimate of the conditional distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$. Existing methods, such as conformalized quantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, usually provide only a marginal coverage guarantee. In contrast, our approach extends these frameworks to achieve approximately conditional coverage, which is crucial for many practical applications. Our prediction sets adapt to the behavior of the predictive distribution, making them effective even under high heteroscedasticity. While exact conditional guarantees are infeasible without assumptions on the underlying data distribution, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the total variation distance of the conditional distribution and its estimate. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of conditional coverage, leading to more reliable statistical inference in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures and their limiting behavior of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation in unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence and limiting behavior of invariant measures of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation driven by linear multiplicative noise and additive noise defined in the entire space $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=1,2$, which describes the phase spins in ferromagnetic materials around the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by a domain expansion method. We then prove the existence of invariant measures by the weak Feller argument. In the case $d=1$, we show the uniform tightness of the set of all invariant measures of the stochastic equation, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of the perturbed equation must be an invariant measure of the limiting system. The cut-off arguments, stopping time techniques and uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are developed to overcome the difficulty caused by the high-order nonlinearity and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings in unbounded domains.</description>
