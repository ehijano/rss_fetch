      <title>Deducibility in the full Lambek calculus with weakening is HAck-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the problem of deciding the consequence relation of the full Lambek calculus with weakening is complete for the class HAck of hyper-Ackermannian problems (i.e., level F_{\omega}^{\omega} of the ordinal-indexed hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes). Provability was already known to be PSPACE-complete. We prove that deducibility is HAck-complete even for the multiplicative fragment. Lower bounds are proved via a novel reduction from reachability in lossy channel systems and the upper bounds are obtained by combining structural proof theory (forward proof search over sequent calculi) and well-quasi-order theory (length theorems for Higman's Lemma).</description>

      <title>Equivalence Hypergraphs: E-Graphs for Monoidal Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technique of equipping graphs with an equivalence relation, called equality saturation, has recently proved both powerful and practical in program optimisation, particularly for satisfiability modulo theory solvers. We give a categorical semantics to these structures, called e-graphs, in terms of Cartesian categories enriched over a semilattice. We show how this semantics can be generalised to monoidal categories, which opens the door to new applications of e-graph techniques, from algebraic to monoidal theories. Finally, we present a sound and complete combinatorial representation of morphisms in such a category, based on a generalisation of hypergraphs which we call e-hypergraphs. They have the usual advantage that many of their structural equations are absorbed into a general notion of isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new and powerful algebraic framework for graph rewriting, based on drags, a class of graphs enjoying a novel composition operator. Graphs are embellished with roots and sprouts, which can be wired together to form edges. Drags enjoy a rich algebraic structure with sums and products. Drag rewriting naturally extends graph rewriting, dag rewriting, and term rewriting models.</description>

      <title>On the Relative Completeness of Satisfaction-based Probabilistic Hoare Logic With While Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Hoare logic (PHL) is an extension of Hoare logic and is specifically useful in verifying randomized programs. It allows researchers to formally reason about the behavior of programs with stochastic elements, ensuring the desired probabilistic properties are upheld. The relative completeness of satisfaction-based PHL has been an open problem ever since the birth of the first PHL in 1979. More specifically, no satisfaction-based PHL with While-loop has been proven to be relatively complete yet. This paper solves this problem by establishing a new PHL with While-loop and prove its relative completeness. The programming language concerned in our PHL is expressively equivalent to the existing PHL systems but brings a lot of convenience in showing completeness. The weakest preterm for While-loop command reveals how it changes the probabilistic properties of computer states, considering both execution branches that halt and infinite runs. We prove the relative completeness of our PHL in two steps. We first establish a semantics and proof system of Hoare triples with probabilistic programs and deterministic assertions. Then, by utilizing the weakest precondition of deterministic assertions, we construct the weakest preterm calculus of probabilistic expressions. The relative completeness of our PHL is then obtained as a consequence of the weakest preterm calculus.</description>

      <title>Logics of polyhedral reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyhedral semantics is a recently introduced branch of spatial modal logic, in which modal formulas are interpreted as piecewise linear subsets of an Euclidean space. Polyhedral semantics for the basic modal language has already been well investigated. However, for many practical applications of polyhedral semantics, it is advantageous to enrich the basic modal language with a reachability modality. Recently, a language with an Until-like spatial modality has been introduced, with demonstrated applicability to the analysis of 3D meshes via model checking. In this paper, we exhibit an axiom system for this logic, and show that it is complete with respect to polyhedral semantics. The proof consists of two major steps: First, we show that this logic, which is built over Grzegorczyk's system $\mathsf{Grz}$, has the finite model property. Subsequently, we show that every formula satisfied in a finite poset is also satisfied in a polyhedral model, thereby establishing polyhedral completeness.</description>

      <title>Transient Evaluation of Non-Markovian Models by Stochastic State Classes and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian models have great expressive power, at the cost of complex analysis of the stochastic process. The method of Stochastic State Classes (SSCs) derives closed-form analytical expressions for the joint Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of the active timers with marginal expolynomial PDF, though being hindered by the number of concurrent non-exponential timers and of discrete events between regenerations. Simulation is an alternative capable of handling the large class of PDFs samplable via inverse transform, which however suffers from rare events. We combine these approaches to analyze time-bounded transient properties of non-Markovian models. We enumerate SSCs near the root of the state-space tree and then rely on simulation to reach the target, affording transient evaluation of models for which the method of SSCs is not viable while reducing computational time and variance of the estimator of transient probabilities with respect to simulation. Promising results are observed in the estimation of rare event probabilities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Probability Logic: Decidability &amp; Computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the decidability and computability issues of dynamic probability logic (DPL) are addressed. Firstly, a proof system $\mathcal{H}_{DPL}$ is introduced for DPL and shown that it is weakly complete. Furthermore, this logic has the finite model property and so is decidable. Secondly, a strongly complete proof system HDPL is presented for DPL and proved that its canonical model is a computable structure.</description>

      <title>Bisimulation for Impure Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative to Kripke models, simplicial complexes are a versatile semantic primitive on which to interpret epistemic logic. Given a set of vertices, a simplicial complex is a downward closed set of subsets, called simplexes, of the vertex set. A maximal simplex is called a facet. Impure simplicial complexes represent that some agents (processes) are dead. It is known that impure simplicial complexes categorically correspond to so-called partial epistemic (Kripke) models. In this contribution, we define a notion of bisimulation to compare impure simplicial complexes and show that it has the Hennessy-Milner property. These results are for a logical language including atoms that express whether agents are alive or dead. Without these atoms no reasonable standard notion of bisimulation exists, as we amply justify by counterexamples, because such a restricted language is insufficiently expressive.</description>

      <title>A Local Search Algorithm for MaxSMT(LIA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MaxSAT modulo theories (MaxSMT) is an important generalization of Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) with various applications. In this paper, we focus on MaxSMT with the background theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic, denoted as MaxSMT(LIA). We design the first local search algorithm for MaxSMT(LIA) called PairLS, based on the following novel ideas. A novel operator called pairwise operator is proposed for integer variables. It extends the original local search operator by simultaneously operating on two variables, enriching the search space. Moreover, a compensation-based picking heuristic is proposed to determine and distinguish the pairwise operations. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our algorithm on massive benchmarks. The results show that our solver is competitive with state-of-the-art MaxSMT solvers. Furthermore, we also apply the pairwise operation to enhance the local search algorithm of SMT, which shows its extensibility.</description>

      <title>Some General Completeness Results for Propositionally Quantified Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the completeness problem for propositionally quantified modal logics on quantifiable general frames, where the admissible sets are the propositions the quantifiers can range over and expressible sets of worlds are admissible, and Kripke frames, where the quantifiers range over all sets of worlds. We show that any normal propositionally quantified modal logic containing all instances of the Barcan scheme is strongly complete with respect to the class of quantifiable general frames validating it. We also provide a sufficient condition for the truth of all formulas, possibly with quantifiers, to be preserved under passing from a quantifiable general frame to its underlying Kripke frame. This is reminiscent of both the idea of elementary submodel in model theory and the persistence concepts in propositional modal logic. The key to this condition is the concept of finite diversity (Fritz 2023), and with it, we show that if $\Theta$ is a set of Sahlqvist formulas whose class of Kripke frames has finite diversity, then the smallest normal propositionally quantified modal logic containing $\Theta$, Barcan, a formula stating the existence of world propositions, and a formula stating the definability of successor sets, is Kripke complete. As a special case, we have a simple finite axiomatization of the logic of Euclidean Kripke frames.</description>

      <title>Optimal matching for sharing and linearity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static analysis of logic programs by abstract interpretation requires designing abstract operators which mimic the concrete ones, such as unification, renaming and projection. In the case of goal-driven analysis, where goal-dependent semantics are used, we also need a backward-unification operator, typically implemented through matching. In this paper we study the problem of deriving optimal abstract matching operators for sharing and linearity properties. We provide an optimal operator for matching in the domain ${\mathtt{ShLin}^{\omega}}$, which can be easily instantiated to derive optimal operators for the domains ${\mathtt{ShLin}^{2}}$ by Andy King and the reduced product $\mathtt{Sharing} \times \mathtt{Lin}$.</description>

      <title>First-order Logic with Being a Thesis Modal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce syntactic modal operator $\BOX$ for \textit{being a thesis} into first-order logic. This logic is a modern realization of R. Carnap's old ideas on modality, as logical necessity (J. Symb. Logic, 1946) \cite{Ca46}. We place it within the modern framework of quantified modal logic with a variant of possible world semantics with variable domains. We prove completeness using a kind of normal form and show that in the canonical frame, the relation on all maximal consistent sets, $R = \{\langle \Gamma, \Delta \rangle : \forall A (\BOX A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow A \in \Delta)\}$, is a universal relation. The strength of the $\BOX$ operator is a proper extension of modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$. Using completeness, we prove that satisfiability in a model of $\BOX A$ under arbitrary valuation implies that $A$ is a thesis of formulated logic. So we can syntactically define logical entailment and consistency. Our semantics differ from S. Kripke's standard one \cite{Kr63} in syntax, semantics, and interpretation of the necessity operator. We also have free variables, contrary to Kripke's and Carnap's approaches, but our notion of substitution is non-standard (variables inside modalities are not free). All $\BOX$-free first-order theses are provable, as well as the Barcan formula and its converse. Our specific theses are \linebreak[4] $\BOX A \to \forall x A$, $\neg \BOX (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX \neg (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX P(x)$, $\neg \BOX \neg P(x)$. We also have $\POS \exists x A(x) \to \POS A(^{y}/_{x})$, and $\forall x \BOX A(x) \to \BOX A(^{y}/_{x})$, if $A$ is a $\BOX$-free formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of decision problems related to inconsistency proofs for formal theories is used to show that under a constructive interpretation of computational complexity classes, an assumption referred to as the MW thesis implies that one may explicitly construct decision problems in NP which are not algorithmically solvable. In particular, in this interpretation the MW thesis implies P $\neq$ NP. It is argued that MW is a naturally valid, yet also naturally unformalizable principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study solutions to systems of stream inclusions of the form 'f in T(f)', where the nondeterministic transformer 'T' on omega-infinite streams is assumed to be causal in the sense that elements in output streams are determined by a finite prefix of inputs. We first establish a correspondence between logic-based causality and metric-based contraction. Based on this causality-contraction connection we then apply fixpoint principles to the spherically complete ultrametric space of streams to construct solutions of stream inclusions. The underlying fixpoint iterations induce fixpoint induction principles to reason about these solutions.In addition, the fixpoint approximation provides an anytime algorithm with which finite prefixes of solutions can be calculated. These developments are illustrated for some central concepts of system design.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent 10 million dollar AIMO challenge, this paper targets the problem of finding all functions conforming to a given specification. This is a popular problem at mathematical competitions and it brings about a number of challenges, primarily, synthesizing the possible solutions and proving that no other solutions exist. Often, there are infinitely many solutions and then the set of solutions has to be captured symbolically. We propose an approach to solving this problem and evaluate it on a set of problems that appeared in mathematical competitions and olympics.</description>

      <title>Lov\'asz Theorems for Modal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous result due to Lov\'{a}sz states that two finite relational structures $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic if, and only if, for all finite relational structures $T$, the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $M$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $N$. Since first-order logic (FOL) can describe finite structures up to isomorphism, this can be interpreted as a characterization of FOL-equivalence via homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to the class of finite structures. We identify classes of labeled transition systems (LTSs) such that homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to these classes, where "counting" is done within an appropriate semiring structure, captures equivalence with respect to positive-existential modal logic, graded modal logic, and hybrid logic, as well as the extensions of these logics with either backward or global modalities. Our positive results apply not only to finite structures, but also to certain well-behaved infinite structures. We also show that equivalence with respect to positive modal logic and equivalence with respect to the basic modal language are not captured by homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to any class of LTSs, regardless of which semiring is used for counting.</description>

      <title>Implications of computer science theory for the simulation hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis has recently excited renewed interest, especially in the physics and philosophy communities. However, the hypothesis specifically concerns \textit{computers} that simulate physical universes, which means that to formally investigate it we need to couple computer science theory with physics. Here I couple those fields with the physical Church-Turing thesis. I then exploit that coupling to investigate of some of the computer science theory aspects of the simulation hypothesis. In particular, I use Kleene's second recursion theorem to prove that it is mathematically possible for us to be a simulation that is being run on a computer - by us. In such a self-simulation, there would be two identical instances of us; the question of which of those is ``really us'' is meaningless. I also show how Rice's theorem provides some interesting impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation; briefly describe the philosophical implications of fully homomorphic encryption for (self-)simulation; and briefly investigate the graphical structure of universes simulating universes simulating universes ..., among other issues. I end by describing some of the possible avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Hashing Modulo Context-Sensitive $\alpha$-Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of $\alpha$-equivalence between $\lambda$-terms is commonly used to identify terms that are considered equal. However, due to the primitive treatment of free variables, this notion falls short when comparing subterms occurring within a larger context. Depending on the usage of the Barendregt convention (choosing different variable names for all involved binders), it will equate either too few or too many subterms. We introduce a formal notion of context-sensitive $\alpha$-equivalence, where two open terms can be compared within a context that resolves their free variables. We show that this equivalence coincides exactly with the notion of bisimulation equivalence. Furthermore, we present an efficient $O(n\log n)$ runtime hashing scheme that identifies $\lambda$-terms modulo context-sensitive $\alpha$-equivalence, generalizing over traditional bisimulation partitioning algorithms and improving upon a previously established $O(n\log^2 n)$ bound for a hashing modulo ordinary $\alpha$-equivalence by Maziarz et al. Hashing $\lambda$-terms is useful in many applications that require common subterm elimination and structure sharing. We have employed the algorithm to obtain a large-scale, densely packed, interconnected graph of mathematical knowledge from the Coq proof assistant for machine learning purposes.</description>

      <title>Modal logic, fundamentally</title>

Abstract: Non-classical generalizations of classical modal logic have been developed in the contexts of constructive mathematics and natural language semantics. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the semantics of non-classical modal logics via algebraic representation theorems. We begin with complete lattices $L$ equipped with an antitone operation $\neg$ sending $1$ to $0$, a completely multiplicative operation $\Box$, and a completely additive operation $\Diamond$. Such lattice expansions can be represented by means of a set $X$ together with binary relations $\vartriangleleft$, $R$, and $Q$, satisfying some first-order conditions, used to represent $(L,\neg)$, $\Box$, and $\Diamond$, respectively. Indeed, any lattice $L$ equipped with such a $\neg$, a multiplicative $\Box$, and an additive $\Diamond$ embeds into the lattice of propositions of a frame $(X,\vartriangleleft,R,Q)$. Building on our recent study of "fundamental logic", we focus on the case where $\neg$ is dually self-adjoint ($a\leq \neg b$ implies $b\leq\neg a$) and $\Diamond \neg a\leq\neg\Box a$. In this case, the representations can be constrained so that $R=Q$, i.e., we need only add a single relation to $(X,\vartriangleleft)$ to represent both $\Box$ and $\Diamond$. Using these results, we prove that a system of fundamental modal logic is sound and complete with respect to an elementary class of bi-relational structures $(X,\vartriangleleft, R)$.</description>

      <title>Compact Proofs of Model Performance via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11779v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose using mechanistic interpretability -- techniques for reverse engineering model weights into human-interpretable algorithms -- to derive and compactly prove formal guarantees on model performance. We prototype this approach by formally proving lower bounds on the accuracy of 151 small transformers trained on a Max-of-$K$ task. We create 102 different computer-assisted proof strategies and assess their length and tightness of bound on each of our models. Using quantitative metrics, we find that shorter proofs seem to require and provide more mechanistic understanding. Moreover, we find that more faithful mechanistic understanding leads to tighter performance bounds. We confirm these connections by qualitatively examining a subset of our proofs. Finally, we identify compounding structureless noise as a key challenge for using mechanistic interpretability to generate compact proofs on model performance.</description>
