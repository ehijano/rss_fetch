      <title>Feasibility of proton bunch compression in an operational high-power accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A muon collider (MC) would require a high-power proton driver to generate intense muon beams at the start of the accelerator chain. Like other high-power facilities, the driver would accumulate intense proton bunches via charge-exchange injection from a linac into a ring. However, unlike other facilities, the MC would require an extreme longitudinal compression of the bunch. We aim to experimentally study the proposed compression scheme at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), which boasts a world-leading proton bunch intensity. In this paper, we describe the operating parameters of the SNS compared to the MC design, the capabilities of the current RF system, and the available beam diagnostics in the SNS accumulator ring. We also present initial simulations and experiments to judge the feasibility of the proposed research.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 4D or 6D phase space distributions from 1D or 2D measurements is a challenging inverse problem encountered in particle accelerators. Entropy maximization is an established method to incorporate prior information in the reconstruction, but it is typically infeasible in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, I review two recent approaches to high-dimensional entropy maximization. The first approach utilizes differentiable simulations and a class of generative models known as \textit{normalizing flows}, whereas the second approach employs the method of Lagrange multipliers and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. My aim is to provide a short explanation of each method using a common notation. I conclude by mentioning several unsolved problems in phase space tomography.</description>

      <title>RF characterization and beam measurements with 3D printed Fast Faraday Cups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stages of most particle accelerator chains produce sub-ns bunches with velocities in the range of 1 to 20% of the speed of light. Fast Faraday Cups (FFC) are designed to measure the longitudinal charge distribution of these short bunches of free charges. Coaxial designs have been utilized at the GSI's linear accelerator UNILAC to characterize ion bunches with bunch lengths ranging from a few hundred ps to a few ns. The typical design goals are to avoid the pre-field of the charges and to suppress secondary electron emission, while retaining the capability of bunch-by-bunch measurements. In this contribution, a novel FFC design manufactured using additive manufacturing, e.g. laser powder bed fusion is presented and compared with a traditionally produced FFC. The design considerations, RF characterization, and selected measurements with ion beam at GSI are shown.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrabrilliant Positron Beam via Superponderomotive Injection in Laser Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma-based acceleration of positrons attracts extensive interests due to the ultrahigh accelerating gradient and ultrashort duration, while generating wakefield positron beam by the inherent injection is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a superponderomotive injection method of positrons in the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In this method, transverse laser fields facilitate the trapping of positrons into the laser-modulated longitudinal wakefield which dominates the subsequent energy gaining, that is distinct from the electrostatic induced superponderomotive electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this method can be implemented by the collision between a donut wake and a pair jet, resulting in the multi-cycle positron beam with hundreds of pC charge and brightness of $10^{13}~\rm{Am}^{-2}$. Such a collisional setup is available in the current laser-plasma experiments, and the generated positron beam is favorable for developing next generation of electron-positron collider, modeling the laboratory astrophysics and performing the ultrafast material diagnostics research.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Plasma Channels for Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preformed plasma channels are essential for guiding high-power laser pulses over extended distances in laser wakefield accelerators, enabling the generation of multi-GeV electron beams for applications such as free-electron lasers and particle colliders. Above-threshold ionization heating provides a robust mechanism for creating laser-matched plasma channels across a wide parameter range, owing to its density- and geometry-independent heating effect. Establishing predictive scaling laws between channel parameters and formation conditions is critical for designing channels optimized for electron acceleration across energies spanning hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV. Through combined timescale analysis and numerical simulations, hydrodynamic expansion is identified as the dominant mechanism governing density profile evolution during ATI channel formation. Remarkably, this process maintains effective laser-guiding channel structures across a wide range of initial gas density, as evidenced by the persistent profile similarity observed despite these significant parameter variations. For parabolic channels matched to Gaussian laser drivers, rigorous scaling laws are established that, the on-axis density scales linearly with the initial gas density, while the matching radius has an exponential dependence on both the initial gas density and the ionization laser radius. These findings provide a systematic framework for the predictive design and optimization of plasma channels in high-efficiency and high-energy LWFA applications.</description>
