      <title>Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction in Rice with High-Dimensional Nonlinear Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genotype-to-Phenotype prediction can promote advances in modern genomic research and crop improvement, guiding precision breeding and genomic selection. However, high-dimensional nonlinear features often hinder the accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype prediction by increasing computational complexity. The challenge also limits the predictive accuracy of traditional approaches. Therefore, effective solutions are needed to improve the accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype prediction. In our paper, we propose MLFformer. MLFformer is a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates the Fast Attention mechanism and a multilayer perceptron module to handle high-dimensional nonlinear features. In MLFformer, the Fast Attention mechanism is utilized to handle computational complexity and enhance processing efficiency. In addition, the MLP structure further captures high-dimensional nonlinear features. Through experiments, the results show that MLFformer reduces the average MAPE by 7.73% compared to the vanilla Transformer. In univariate and multivariate prediction scenarios, MLFformer achieves the best predictive performance among all compared models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Reproduction Number from Epidemiological and Genetic Data Using Particle MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference of the reproduction number through time is of vital importance during an epidemic outbreak. Typically, epidemiologists tackle this using observed prevalence or incidence data. However, prevalence and incidence data alone is often noisy or partial. Models can also have identifiability issues with determining whether a large amount of a small epidemic or a small amount of a large epidemic has been observed. Sequencing data however is becoming more abundant, so approaches which can incorporate genetic data are an active area of research. We propose using particle MCMC methods to infer the time-varying reproduction number from a combination of prevalence data reported at a set of discrete times and a dated phylogeny reconstructed from sequences. We validate our approach on simulated epidemics with a variety of scenarios. We then apply the method to real data sets of HIV-1 in North Carolina, USA and tuberculosis in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The models and algorithms are implemented in an open source R package called EpiSky which is available at https://github.com/alicia-gill/EpiSky.</description>
