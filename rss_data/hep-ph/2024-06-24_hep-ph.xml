      <title>Constraints on Heavy Asymmetric and Symmetric Dark Matter from the Glashow Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can lead to distinct neutrino signatures characterized by an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. In the high-energy regime, the Glashow resonant interaction $\bar{\nu}_{e} + e^{-} \rightarrow W^{-}$ yields an increase in sensitivity to the neutrino flux, and stands out as the only way of discerning the antineutrino component in the diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. This offers a unique opportunity in the search for dark matter with masses above the PeV scale. We examine the neutrino signal stemming from ADM decay and set the first stringent constraints on ADM lifetime $\tau_X$. For ADM with mass $m_X\gtrsim 10$ PeV, we find $\tau_X\lesssim 10^{29}$s using the data from the recent IceCube search for Glashow resonance events. Our projections further show that sensitivities at the forthcoming IceCube-Gen2 could approach $10^{30}$s, depending on the decay channel. The current constraints on symmetric dark matter decay to neutrinos are also improved by up to a factor of 3 thanks to the Glashow resonance.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thresholds in $B\to (P,V)\gamma^*$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of anomalous thresholds on the non-local form factors describing the hadronization of the light-quark contribution to $B\to(P,V)\gamma^*$ transitions. Starting from a comprehensive discussion of anomalous thresholds in the triangle loop function for different mass configurations, we detail how the dispersion relation for $\pi\pi$ intermediate states is affected by contour deformations mandated by the anomalous branch points. Phenomenological estimates of the size of the anomalous contributions to the form factors are provided with couplings determined from measured branching fractions and Dalitz plot distributions. Our key finding is that anomalous effects are suppressed on the $\rho(770)$ resonance, while off-peak the effects can become as large as $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the full (light-quark-loop induced) non-local form factors. We comment on future generalizations towards higher intermediate states and the charm loop, outlining how the dispersive framework established in this work could help improve the non-local form factors needed as input for a robust interpretation of $B\to (P,V)\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>Fusing photons into diphoton resonances at Belle II and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new search for a diphoton resonance in the $e^+e^-+\gamma\gamma$ final state at Belle II that improves the expected reach compared to the $\gamma+\gamma\gamma$ channel in most of the available mass range. For simplicity we show our results in the simple parameter space of an ALP coupled solely to Standard Model photons. In addition, we show how an extension of the forward coverage of Belle II, or another similar experiment at the high intensity frontier, could improve the reach in our channel. We show that such a forward extension can be advantageous even with a loss of a factor 100 in luminosity compared to Belle II.</description>

      <title>On the Thermodynamics of Continuous Spin photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Special relativity allows massless particles to have states of different integer (or half-integer) helicities that mix under boosts, much like the spin-states of a massive particle. Such massless particles are known as continuous spin particles (CSPs), a term coined by Wigner, and they are notable for their infinite tower of spin polarizations. The mixing under boosts is controlled by a spin-scale $\rho$ with units of momentum. Normally, we assume $\rho=0$. The interactions of CSPs are known to satisfy certain simple properties, one of which is that the $\rho \rightarrow 0$ limit generically recovers familiar interactions of massless scalars, photons, or gravitons, with all other polarizations decoupling in this limit. Thus, one can ask if the photon of the Standard Model is a CSP at small but non-zero $\rho$. One concern about this possibility -- originally raised by Wigner -- is that the infinite tower of polarizations could pose problems for thermodynamics. To address this question, we study the thermal evolution of a CSP photon gas coupled to isothermal matter, across CSP helicity modes and phase space. We find that the structure of the interactions dictated by Lorentz symmetry imply well behaved thermodynamics. When the CSP photon's interactions to charged matter are turned on, the primary $h=\pm 1$ helicity modes thermalize quickly, while the other modes require increasingly long time-scales to thermalize, set by powers of $T/\rho$. In familiar thermal systems, the CSP photon behaves like the QED photon with small $\rho$- and time- dependent corrections to its effective relativistic degrees of freedom. Sizable departures from familiar thermal behavior arise at energy scales comparable to $\rho$ and could have testable experimental consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note gives an overview of the tools for predicting expectations in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) at the tree level and one loop available through event generators. Methods of event reweighting, the separate simulation of squared matrix elements, and the simulation of the full SMEFT process are compared in terms of statistical efficacy and potential biases.</description>

      <title>Gluon radiation inside a flowing medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectrum of gluons emitted by a highly energetic quark inside a flowing QCD medium, focusing on the soft gluon limit at first order in the opacity expansion. Specifically, we derive the leading energy-suppressed corrections to the double differential final parton distribution, and show that they are substantial for both static and flowing matter. In particular, we demonstrate that the corrections due to the transverse flow become large even at moderate energies and flow velocities, affecting drastically both the shape and magnitude of the spectrum. We observe that the final transverse momentum of the emitted gluon tends to align along the flow direction, resulting in a non-trivial azimuthal distribution. These results can be directly implemented into the estimation of multiple observables to get a better understanding of the jet-medium interaction processes in HICs.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and gravitational waves in maximally symmetric composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study phase transitions in a maximally symmetric composite Higgs model with next-to-minimal coset, where a pseudoscalar singlet emerges alongside the Higgs doublet. The maximal symmetry guarantees the finiteness of the radiatively generated scalar potential. We explore the scenario involving an explicit source of CP violation in the strong sector, which induces a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ asymmetric scalar potential, and consequently leads to nonzero vacuum expectation value for the singlet. Current experimental bounds from the LHC are imposed on the masses of the composite resonances, while the CP violating interactions of the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons are tightly constrained from the measurements of the electric dipole moment of the electron. We compute the finite temperature corrections to the potential, incorporating the momentum-dependent form factors in the loop integrals to capture the effect of the strong dynamics. The impact of the resonances from the strong sector on the finite temperature potential are exponentially suppressed. The presence of explicit CP violation leads to strong first-order phase transition from a false vacuum to the electroweak vacuum where the pseudoscalar singlet has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. We illustrate that, as a result of such phase transitions, the production of potentially observable gravitational waves at future detectors will offer a complementary avenue to probe the composite Higgs models, distinct from collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Double DVCS amplitudes including kinematic twist-3 and 4 corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are off-forward matrix elements of quark and gluon operators that work as a window to the total angular momentum of partons and their transverse imaging (nucleon tomography). To access GPDs one needs to look into exclusive processes which are usually studied in a kinematic regime known as the Bj\"orken limit. In this limit, the photon virtualities are much larger than the hadron mass $M$, and the kick to the hadron measured by the Mandelstam's variable $t$. It turns out that this is not enough for the purposes of a precise GPD extraction and, in particular, of nucleon tomography for which measurements in a sizable range of $t$ are required. Deviation with respect to the Bj\"orken limit induces kinematic higher-twist corrections which enter the amplitudes with powers of $|t|/\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $M^2/\mathbb{Q}^2$, where $\mathbb{Q}^2$ denotes the scale of the process (basically, the sum of photon virtualities in the case of DDVCS). There are also corrections by the name of "genuine" higher twists which are a separate topic and are not the subject of this research study.
  In this manuscript, we present novel calculations of DDVCS amplitudes off a (pseudo-)scalar target including up to kinematic twist-4 corrections. These results are important for measuring DDVCS, DVCS and TCS through the Sullivan process and off helium-4 target at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and JLab experiments. Preliminary numerical estimates for the pion target are provided.</description>

      <title>Electric Conductivity of QCD Matter and Dilepton Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm el}$, is a fundamental transport coefficient of QCD matter that can be related to the zero-energy limit of the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function at vanishing 3-momentum in the medium. The EM spectral function is also the central quantity to describe the thermal emission rates and pertinent spectra of photon and dilepton radiation in heavy-ion collisions. Employing a model for dilepton rates that combines hadronic many-body theory with nonperturbative QGP emission constrained by lattice-QCD which describes existing dilepton measurements in heavy-ion collisions, we investigate the sensitivity of low-mass dilepton spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC to $\sigma_{\rm el}$. In particular, we disentangle the contributions from QGP and hadronic emission, and identify signatures that can help to extract $\sigma_{\rm el}$ from high-precision experimental data expected to be attainable with future detector systems at the LHC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the value of the magnetic dipole moment of the $\rho$ meson using data from the BaBar Collaboration for the $e^{+} e^{-} \to \pi^+ \pi^- 2 \pi^0$ process, in the center of mass energy range from 0.9 to 1.8 GeV. We describe the $\gamma^* \to 4\pi$ vertex using a vector meson dominance model, including the intermediate resonant contributions relevant at these energies. We find $\mu_\rho = 2.7 \pm 0.3 $ in $e/2 m_\rho$ units. We improve on the previous extracted value, where preliminary data from the same collaboration was used, by considering definite data, better grounded values of the parameters involved and explicit gauge invariant description of the process.</description>

      <title>Pentaquark molecular states with hidden bottom and double strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the meson-baryon interaction in coupled channels with the quantum numbers of the pentaquarks $P_{bss}$ and $P_{bsss}$. The interaction is derived from an extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector, which has demonstrated accurate results compared to experiments involving $\Omega_{b}$, $\Xi_{b}$ states, and pentaquarks $P_{c}$ and $P_{cs}$. In our study, we identify several molecular states with small decay widths within the chosen set of coupled channels. The spin-parity ($J^P$) of these states is as follows: $J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-$ for pseudoscalar-baryon (${\frac{1}{2}}^+$) coupled channels, $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-$ for pseudoscalar-baryon (${\frac{3}{2}}^+$) coupled channels, $J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-$ and ${\frac{3}{2}}^-$ for vector-baryon (${\frac{1}{2}}^+$) coupled channels, and $J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{3}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{5}{2}}^-$ for vector-baryon (${\frac{3}{2}}^+$) coupled channels. We search for the poles of these states and evaluate their couplings to the different channels.</description>

Abstract: Different ways exist to obtain the elements of the $\{\beta \}$-expansion for renormgroup invariant quantities. Here we consider independent confirmation within the standard QCD of a number of our results [1] for the values of elements of this expansion for the nonsinglet Adler $D_A$-function, Bjorken polarized sum rules $S^{Bjp}$ up to the order N$^4$LO. We suggest an approach to estimate the results of high order QCD calculations using a smaller number of diagrams of the specific type. This type is based on a proposed generalization of Naive NonAbelianization.</description>

      <title>Probing light sterile neutrinos in left-right symmetric models with displaced vertices and neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation of relatively light (GeV-scale), long-lived right-handed neutrinos is performed within minimal left-right symmetric models using the neutrino-extended Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. Light sterile neutrinos can be produced through rare decays of kaons, $D$-mesons, and $B$-mesons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) of Fermilab. Their decays could result in displaced vertices, which can be reconstructed. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, we assess the sensitivities of the future LHC far-detector experiments ANUBIS, CODEX-b, FACET, FASER(2), MoEDAL-MAPP1(2), MATHUSLA, the recently approved beam-dump experiment SHiP, and the upcoming neutrino experiment DUNE at the LBNF, to the right-handed gauge-boson mass $M_{W_R}$ as functions of neutrino masses. We find that DUNE and SHiP could be sensitive to right-handed gauge-boson masses up to $\sim 25$ TeV. We compare this reach to indirect searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay, finding that displaced-vertex searches are very competitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of magnetic and electric dipole moments are important tests of the Standard Model and beyond Standard Model physics, particularly for the electron and the muon. However, the situation presents distinctive challenges when dealing with the tau lepton due to its very short lifetime and relatively high mass. Here, we review the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of both the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton.

      <title>The Sensitivity of DUNE in Presence of Off-Diagonal Scalar NSI Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar non-standard interactions (NSI) presents an exciting pathway for probing potential new physics that extends beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The scalar coupling of neutrinos with matter can appear as a sub-dominant effect that can impact the neutrino oscillation probabilities. The uniqueness of these interactions is that it can directly affect the neutrino mass matrix. This makes oscillations sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass. The effects of scalar NSI scales linearly with matter density which motivates its exploration in long-baseline sector. The presence of scalar NSI can influence the key measurements in the field of neutrino physics, including the precise determination of the leptonic CP phase ($\delta_{CP}$), neutrino mass ordering and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. The precise determination of $\delta_{CP}$ is one of the major goals of DUNE, which is an upcoming long-baseline experiment. A better understanding of the impact of scalar NSI on CP measurement sensitivities is crucial for accurate interpretation of $\delta_{CP}$ phase. In this work, we have explored the impact of the complex off-diagonal scalar NSI elements $\eta_{\alpha\beta}$ and their associated phases $\phi_{\alpha\beta}$ on the CP-measurement sensitivities at DUNE. We have explored the impact of the neutrino mass scale on these sensitivities. We look for constraining these off-diagonal elements for different neutrino mass scales. We also explore their correlation with $\delta_{CP}$, investigating potential degeneracies that can arise due to additional phases. We also perform a correlation study among different scalar NSI elements. We show that the inclusion of the complex scalar NSI elements can significantly modify the CP phase measurements.</description>

Abstract: At the earliest stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the produced matter is a highly populated system of gluons called glasma which can be approximately described in terms of classical chromodynamic fields. Although the system's dynamics is governed by Yang-Mills equations, glasma evolution is shown to strongly resemble hydrodynamic behaviour.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to obtain the optimal weight function of 9 paths in (3+1)D space-time whose length is less than or equal to $2\times (6+2)$ lattice units. The factor 2 comes from inclusion of opposite direction path or time reversed paths. There are $2\times 2$ time shifts, which we assume that they can be regarded as stochastic Markov processes. We prepare the input 9D vector ${\bf X}$ and a $9\times 9$ matrix ${\bf W}$ and a bias vector ${\bf b}$, and consider affine transformations ${\bf Z}^{(h)}={\bf X}^{(in)}{\bf W}^{(h)T}+{\bf b}^{(h)}$ and ${\bf A}^{(h)}=\sigma({\bf Z}^{(h)})$ from an input layer to a hidden layer, the hidden layer to another hidden layer and from the hidden layer to an output layer, using the transformation ${\bf Z}^{(x)}={\bf A}^{(h)}{\bf W}^{(out) T} +{\bf b}^{(x)}$ and ${\bf A}^{(x)}=\sigma({\bf Z}^{(x)})$.
  By choosing the matrix ${\bf W}$ a diagonal matrix, and introducing the information of action of the 9 paths, a simple Monte Carlo simulation yields actions on a 2D plane spanned by $e_1, e_2$ for a fixed $u_2=j_2 e_2$ as a function of $u_1=j_1 e_1$. The action at high momentum region has small fluctuations, but at small momentum region, has large fluctuation. Generalizing $\bf W$ including mixing of paths, we search the optimal weight function using the Machine Learning (ML) techniques. For fixed point actions, actions of the output layer are defined by the output of final hidden layer</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Spacelike Splitting Amplitude for N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of collinear behavior for gauge theories in the spacelike region is of great phenomenological and theoretical importance. We analytically calculate the two-loop spacelike splitting amplitude for the full color N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory. The result is derived by two complementary methods starting from the known amplitude: one is based on a discontinuity analysis, while the other one is based on analytic continuation. Our result explicitly shows terms that violate naive factorization. However we show that factorization is restored at the level of color-summed unpolarized squared amplitudes at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order. We conjecture that the two-loop tripole terms in the generalized splitting amplitudes in QCD are identical to what we obtain in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The Tropical Geometry of Subtraction Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction of local subtraction schemes through the lenses of tropical geometry. We focus on individual Feynman integrals in parametric presentation, and think of them as particular instances of Euler integrals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a combination of Euler integrands to be locally finite, i.e. to be expandable as a Taylor series in the exponent variables directly under sign of integration. We use this to construct a local subtraction scheme that is applicable to a class of Euler integrals that satisfy a certain geometric property. We apply this to compute the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ of various Feynman integrals involving both UV and IR singularities, as well as to generalizations of Feynman integrals that arise in effective field theories and in phase-space integrations.</description>

      <title>On small Dirac Neutrino Masses in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how tiny Dirac neutrino masses consistent with experimental constraints can arise in string theory SM-like vacua. We use as a laboratory 4d ${\cal N}=1$ type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifold compactifications, and in particular recent results on Yukawa couplings at infinite field-space distance. In this regime we find Dirac neutrino masses of the form $m_\nu \simeq g_\nu\langle H\rangle$, with $g_{\nu}$ the gauge coupling of the massive $U(1)$ under which the right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ are charged, and which should be in the range $g_{\nu}\simeq 10^{-14}-10^{-12}$ to reproduce neutrino data. The neutrino mass suppression occurs because the right-handed neutrino kinetic term behaves as $K_{\nu\nu} \simeq 1 /g_{\nu}^2 $. At the same time a tower of $\nu_R$-like states appears with characteristic scale $m_0\simeq g_{\nu}^2M_{\rm P}\simeq 0.1-500$ eV, in agreement with Swampland expectations. Two large hidden dimensions only felt by the $\nu_R$ sector arise at the same scale, while the string scale is around $M_s\simeq g_\nu M_{\rm P}\simeq 10-700$ TeV. Some phenomenological implications and model building challenges are described. As a byproduct, independently of the neutrino issue, we argue that a single large dimension in the context of SM-like type IIA Calabi--Yau orientifolds leads to too small Yukawa couplings for quarks and charged leptons.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive survey of hybrid equations of state in neutron star mergers and constraints on the hadron-quark phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive study of equation of state (EoS) models featuring a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in neutron star merger simulations. We employ three different hadronic EoSs, a constant speed of sound parameterization for the quark phase and a Maxwell construction to generate a large sample of hybrid EoS models. We systematically vary the onset density and density jump of the phase transition as well as the quark matter stiffness and simulate binary neutron star mergers to infer how the properties of the phase transition affect the gravitational-wave signal. In total we simulate mergers with 245 different hybrid EoS models. In particular, we explore in which scenarios a phase transition would be detectable by a characteristically increased postmerger gravitational-wave frequency compared to an estimate from the inspiral signal assuming a purely hadronic EoS. We find that the density jump at the transition (latent heat) has the largest impact on the gravitational-wave frequencies, while the influence of the stiffness of quark matter is smaller. We quantify which range of phase transition properties would be compatible with a certain magnitude or absence of the gravitational-wave postmerger frequency shift. By means of these dependencies, a future detection will thus directly yield constraints on the allowed features of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering and Beyond from Extreme Mass Ratio Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

Abstract: After recasting the standard charged and uncharged brane profiles in the harmonic gauge, we explore solutions with the same isometries where the potentials $V = T \,e^{\gamma\,\phi}$ of ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings are taken into account. Combining a detailed catalog of the possible asymptotics with some numerical results suggests that these spherically symmetric backgrounds terminate at singularities within finite proper distances.</description>

      <title>High energy neutrino production in gamma-ray bursts: dependence of the neutrino signal on the jet composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy nuclei can be synthetized or entrained in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with implications on the high-energy neutrino emission. By means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm, we model nuclear cascades and investigate their impact on the neutrino production considering kinetic dominated jets (in the internal shock model, including a dissipative photosphere) as well as Poynting flux dominated jets (for a jet model invoking internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence, ICMART). We find that the ICMART model allows for efficient nuclear cascades leading to an overall larger neutrino fluence than in the other two jet models. The survival of nuclei and inefficient nuclear cascades lead to an overall reduction of the neutrino fluence up to one order of magnitude. However, if nuclei are disintegrated, the neutrino fluence may be comparable to the one emitted from a jet loaded with protons. Exploring the parameter space of jet properties, we conclude that the composition and the bulk Lorentz factor have significant impact on the efficiency of nuclear cascades as well as the spectral shape of the expected neutrino fluence. On the other hand, the neutrino spectral distribution is less sensitive to the power-law index of the accelerated population of protons or heavier nuclei. For what concerns the diffuse emission of neutrinos from GRBs, we find that the uncertainty due to the jet composition can be at most comparable to the one related to the GRB cosmological rate.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal particle production in Einstein-Cartan gravity with modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-thermal fermionic particle production is investigated in Einstein-Cartan modified gravity with a modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings between the spin connection and a fermion. By using the auxiliary field method, the theory is rewritten into a pseudoscalar-tensor theory with Einstein-Hilbert action and canonical kinetic and potential terms for a pseudoscalar field. The introduced field is called Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron. If the potential energy of the Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron dominates the energy density of the early universe, it causes inflationary expansion. After the end of inflation, the pseudoscalaron develops a large value and the non-minimal couplings destabilize the vacuum. Evaluating the non-thermal fermionic particle production process, we obtain the mass and the helicity dependences of the produced particle number density. We show the model parameters to enhance the preheating and reheating processes.</description>

      <title>$^3$He spin-dependent structure functions within the relativistic Light-Front Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^3$He spin-dependent structure functions, $g^3_1(x)$ and $g^3_2(x)$, which parametrize the hadronic tensor in polarized deep-inelastic scattering, were evaluated within the Poincar\'e covariant light-front framework. The Bakamjian-Thomas construction of the Poincar\'e generators allows us to make use of a realistic $^3$He wave function, obtained from refined nuclear phenomenological potentials. The same approach was already successfully applied to the $^3$He and $^4$He unpolarized deep-inelastic scattering. To investigate the neutron polarized structure functions, $g^n_1$ and $g^n_2$, a readily implementable procedure, aimed at extracting the neutron spin structure functions from those of $^3$He, is shown to hold. Moreover, the first moment of $g^3_1(x)$ was evaluated, aiming at providing a valuable check of the Bjorken sum rule. The present analysis is relevant for experiments nvolving polarized beams planned at the future facilities, like the Electron Ion Colliders.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic isovector form factors of the transition from the $N^*(1520)$ to the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15115v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersion theory is used to provide a model-independent low-energy representation of the three electromagnetic isovector transition form factors $N^{*}(1520)\to N$. At low energies the virtual photon couples dominantly to a pion pair. Taking the very well understood pion vector form factor and pion re-scattering into consideration, the determination of the transition form factors is traced back to the determination of pion-baryon scattering amplitudes. Their low-energy aspects are parametrized by baryon exchange, accounting for the main decay channels of the $N^*(1520)$. Short-distance physics is encoded in subtraction constants that are fitted to data on space-like form factors and hadronic decays. It is shown that a limitation in the determination of the subtraction constants lies in the fact that isovector form factors require sufficient information about the differences between protons and neutrons. In particular, this calls for improvements in the form factor extraction from the electroproduction of the $N^*(1520)$ on the neutron. Via the dispersion relations, space- and time-like regions are naturally connected from first principles. This allows to predict the time-like form factors that enter the Dalitz decays $N^*(1520)\to N e^- e^+$ and $N^*(1520)\to N \mu^- \mu^+$. Under the assumption of the dominance of the isovector over the isoscalar channel, the Dalitz decay distributions are predicted.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new observable derived from a centrality-dependent scaling of transverse particle spectra. By removing the global scales of total particle number and mean transverse momentum, we isolate the shape of the spectrum. In hydrodynamic simulations, while the multiplicity and mean transverse momentum fluctuate significantly, the scaled spectrum is found to be almost constant even at an event-by-event level and after resonance decays. This universality survives when averaging over events in each centrality bin before scaling. We then investigate the presence of this scaling in experimental data from the ALICE collaboration in Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, and p-Pb collisions. We find a remarkable universality in the experimentally observed scaled spectra at low transverse momentum, compatible with hydrodynamic predictions. The data show a minor breaking of universality at large transverse momentum and hints of evolution with the system size that are not seen in simulations. Our results motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations of this new observable to bring to light the collective and non-collective behavior encoded in the transverse particle spectrum of different collision systems.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of first-order phase transitions in strongly coupled systems are relevant in a variety of systems, from heavy ion collisions to the early universe. Holographic theories can be used to model these systems, with fluctuations usually suppressed. In this case the system can come close to a spinodal point where theory and experiments indicate that the the behaviour should be similar to a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We study this question using a simple holographic model and confirm that there is critical slowing down and scaling behaviour close to the spinodal point, with precise quantitative estimates. In addition, we determine the start of the scaling regime for the breakdown of quasistatic evolution when the temperature of a thermal bath is slowly decreased across the transition. We also extend the analysis to the dynamics of second-order phase transitions and strong crossovers.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. The possible existence of hybrid stars is investigated using microscopic models to describe the different phases of matter. Within these microscopic models we aim at calculating the properties of neutron stars and matter. We want to probe the influence of pQCD calculations and analyze the properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. A Bayesian approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling process is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state. A Maxwell construction describes the deconfinement transition. For the hadronic phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with non-linear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use two different models: the NJL model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, similar to the MIT bag model with a vector term. The model parameters were determined by Bayesian inference imposing observations from NICER and the phase transition density range. We have also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The restrictions of pQCD reduce the value of the maximum mass. However, even when applying this restriction, the models were able to reach 2.1 to 2.3 solar masses. The conformal limit was not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above two solar masses. The multiquark interactions affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Revisiting big bang nucleosynthesis with a new particle species : effect of co-annihilation with nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10499v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), the light matter abundance is dictated by the neutron-to-proton ($n/p$) ratio which is controlled by the standard weak processes in the early universe. Here, we study the effect of an extra particle species ($\chi$) which \textit{co-annihilates} with neutron (proton), thereby potentially changing the ($n/p$) ratio in addition to the former processes. We find a novel interplay between the co-annihilation and the weak interaction in deciding the ($n/p$) ratio and the yield of $\chi$. Large co-annihilation strength ($G_D$) in comparison to the weak coupling ($G_F$), potentially can alter the number of nucleons in the thermal bath modifying the ($n/p$) ratio from its standard evolution. We find that the standard BBN prediction is restored for $G_D/G_F \lesssim 10^{-2}$, while the mass of $\chi$ being much smaller than the neutron mass. When the mass of $\chi$ is comparable to the neutron mass, we can allow large $G_D/G_F ~(\gtrsim 10^2)$ values, as the thermal abundance of $\chi$ becomes Boltzmann-suppressed. Therefore, the ($n/p$) ratio is restored to its standard value via dominant weak processes in later epochs. We also discuss the stability of the new particle in an effective theroy framework for co-annihilation. Further, the co-annihilation interaction generates elastic scattering of $\chi$ and nucleons at the next-to-leading order. This provides a way to probe the scenario in direct detection experiments, if $\chi$ is accidentally stable over cosmological timescale.</description>

      <title>A seesaw model for large neutrino masses in concordance with cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses can be relaxed if the number density of active neutrinos is reduced compared to the standard scenario, while at the same time keeping the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}\approx 3$ by introducing a new component of dark radiation. We discuss a UV complete model to realise this idea, which simultaneously provides neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. It is based on a $U(1)$ symmetry in the dark sector, which can be either gauged or global. In addition to heavy seesaw neutrinos, we need to introduce $\mathcal{O}(10)$ generations of massless sterile neutrinos providing the dark radiation. Then we can accommodate active neutrino masses with $\sum m_\nu \sim 1$ eV, in the sensitivity range of the KATRIN experiment. We discuss the phenomenology of the model and identify the allowed parameter space. We argue that the gauged version of the model is preferred, and in this case the typical energy scale of the model is in the 10 MeV to few GeV range.</description>

      <title>Maximising the physics potential of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm\mu^+\mu^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method that maximises the experimental sensitivity to new physics contributions in $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. This method relies on performing an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to both the measured dimuon $q^2$ distribution of $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, and theory calculations at spacelike $q^2$, where QCD predictions are most reliable. We exploit the known analytic properties of the decay amplitude and employ a dispersion relation to describe the non-local hadronic contributions across spacelike and timelike $q^2$ regions. The fit stability and the sensitivity to new physics couplings and new sources of $CP$-violation are studied for current and future data-taking scenarios, with the LHCb experiment as an example. The proposed method offers a precise and reliable way to search for new physics in these decays.</description>

      <title>Constraining the General Oscillatory Inflaton Potential with Freeze-in Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reheating phase after inflation is one of the least observationally constrained epochs in the evolution of the Universe. The forthcoming gravitational wave observatories will enable us to constrain at least some of the non-standard scenarios. For example, models where the radiation bath is produced by the perturbative inflaton decay that oscillates around the minimum of the potential of the form $V\propto\phi^{2n}$, with $n&gt;2$. In such scenarios a part of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum becomes blue tilted, making it observable, depending on the inflation energy scale and the reheating temperature. The degeneracy between the latter two parameters can be broken if dark matter in the Universe is produced via the freeze-in mechanism. The combination of the independent measurement of dark matter mass with gravitational wave observations makes it possible to constrain the reheating temperature and the energy scale at the end of inflation, at least within some parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulations of colliding superconducting strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collisions of elastic superconducting strings, also referred to as current-carrying strings, formed in a $U_{\rm local}(1) \times U_{\rm global}(1)$ field-theory model, using three-dimensional numerical field-theoretic simulations. The breaking of $U_{\rm local}(1)$ leads to string formation via the Higgs mechanism, while the scalar field of the second $U_{\rm global}(1)$ carries the current, which condenses onto the string. We construct straight and static superconducting string solutions numerically and identify the regions in which they exist in the model parameter space. We then perform dynamical simulations for colliding superconducting strings with various collision angles and collision velocities. We explore the kinematic parameter space for six sets of model parameters characterising the coupling between the two scalar fields and the current on the string. The final states of the strings (after the collision) are reported diagrammatically. We classify them into four categories: (i) regular intercommutation, (ii) double intercommutation, (iii) bound state, and (iv) expanding string solution. We find that the outcome of the collision process is the regular intercommutation of the colliding strings in most of the kinematic parameter space while they form bound states for small velocities and small angles. We also find that the strings undergo two successive intercommutations and, therefore, pass through one other in a small region corresponding to relatively small angles and velocities of order c/2. The string structure breaks down when there is a relatively large coupling between the two scalar fields, even if each string is stable before the occurrence of the collision.</description>

Abstract: We present results for the $\tau_1$ and $\tau_{1a}$ 1-Jettiness global event shape distributions, for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), at the N$^3$LL + ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ level of accuracy. These event-shape distributions quantify and characterize the pattern of final state radiation in electron-nucleus collisions. They can be used as a probe of nuclear structure functions, nuclear medium effects in jet production, and for a precision extraction of the QCD strong coupling. The results presented here, along with the corresponding numerical codes, can be used for analyses with HERA data, in EIC simulation studies, and for eventual comparison with real EIC data.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics in light of recent developments in $b \rightarrow c \ell \nu$ transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental studies of the observables associated with the $b \rightarrow c$ transitions in the semileptonic $B-$ meson decays at BaBar, Belle and LHCb have shown some deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions, consequently, providing a handy tool to probe the possible new physics (NP). In this context, we have first revisited the impact of recent measurements of $R({D^{(*)}})$ and $R(\Lambda_c)$ on the parametric space of the NP scenarios. In addition, we have included the $R(J/\psi)$ data in the analysis and found that their influence on the best-fit points and the parametric space is mild. Using the recent HFLAV data, after validating the well established sum rule of $R(\Lambda_c)$, we derived the similar sum rule for $R(J/\psi)$. Furthermore, according to the updated data, we have modified the correlation among the different observables, giving us their interesting interdependence. Finally, to discriminate the various NP scenarios, we have plotted the different angular observables and their ratios for $B \to D^* \tau\nu_\tau$ against the transfer momentum square $\left(q^2\right)$, using the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ parametric space of considered NP scenarios. By implementing the collider bounds on NP Wilson coefficients, we find that, in the parametric space of some NP WCs is significantly restrained. To see the clear influence of NP on the amplitude of the angular observables, we have also calculated their numerical values in different $q^2$ bins and shown them through the bar plots. We hope their precise measurements will help to discriminate various NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Structure of Heavy Mesons in the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of ground-state heavy mesons within the light-front quark model, utilizing wave functions derived from the Single Gaussian Ansatz (SGA) and the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM). By performing a $\chi^2$ fit to static properties such as mass spectra and decay constants, we determine the model parameters for each approach. We then compare the impacts of both methods on the light-front wave functions and structural observables. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the distribution amplitudes (DAs) $\phi_{2;M}(x)$ near the endpoints, with GEM showing enhanced amplitudes and correct asymptotic behavior $\phi_{2;M}(x \to 1) \propto (1-x)$, consistent with perturbative QCD. This endpoint behavior is linked to the short-range (high-momentum) wave function governed by color Coulomb interaction and relativistic kinematics. GEM accurately reproduces a power-law damping $\psi_0(k \to \infty) \propto 1/k_\perp^2$, aligning with perturbative QCD predictions. Furthermore, the electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons in the low-$Q^2$ region fall off faster with GEM than with SGA. Overall, while both methods adequately describe static properties, GEM provides a more accurate description of structural properties, being more sensitive to details and asymptotic behaviors.</description>

      <title>A potential approach to the $X(3872)$ thermal behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the potential of $X(3872)$ at finite temperature in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation under the assumption that it is a tetraquark. We argue that, at large number of colors, it is a good approximation to assume that the potential consists in a real part plus a constant imaginary term. The real part is then computed adapting an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty and using as input lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. This model allows us to qualitatively estimate at which temperature range the formation of a heavy tetraquark is possible, and to propose a qualitative picture for the dissociation of the state in a medium. Our approach can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the $X(3872)$ and to other exotic states.</description>

      <title>Swamplandish Unification of the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short overview of recent progress made in our understanding of the dark sector based on the Swampland program which in turn is rooted in lessons from string theory. We explain how the existence of one extra mesoscopic dimension (the ``dark dimension") in the micron range emerges and how this can lead to a unification of the dark energy and dark matter. In particular the smallness of the dark energy leads to the prediction of the existence of a tower of weakly interacting light particles which can naturally play the role of dark matter. Moreover this unifies dark matter with gravity as dark matter ends up being excitations of graviton in the dark dimension. We also explain how in combination with other Swampland principles one finds an explanation of the ``why now" and the ``cosmological coincidence" problems. This model is consistent with the cosmological bounds as well as the Newton's inverse square law, but makes predictions which differ from $\Lambda$CDM. It also gives rise to an appealing picture of hierarchy of scales in particle physics pegged to the dark energy, including a possible origin of the electroweak hierarchy and the prediction of masses of QCD axion and sterile neutrinos both in the 1-10 meV range. This review is intended for a broad audience of high energy theorists and cosmologists without prior knowledge of string theory and it explains the motivations and predictions of this program in a non-technical form.</description>

      <title>Collider sensitivity to SMEFT heavy-quark operators at one-loop in top-quark processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of four-heavy-quark operators in the production of top quarks in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at the LHC. In particular, we compute for the first time the total contribution of the four-top-quark operator which enters only at the one-loop level in the top-quark pair production process. Analytical results at one-loop are presented for the gluon- and quark-initiated sub-processes, which allowed a first complete validation of the SMEFT@NLO in Madgraph5_aMC@NLO. The 95% CL bounds on four-heavy-quark operators from the available top-quark pair and four-top-quark production data are provided, which are complementary to other bounds found in the literature. We focus on the comparison of the sensitivities of the top-quark pair and the four-top-quark production processes, where in the latter case the four-top-quark operator contributes at tree-level. We conclude that the sensitivities of the two processes to four-heavy-quark operators are comparable. The projected sensitivities of both processes at HL-LHC are also presented.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis by a sliding pNGB with symmetry non-restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) with an initial misalignment angle can drive successful spontaneous baryogenesis, and become a good dark matter candidate if the corresponding global symmetry is non-restored at high temperatures. Considering a dimension-five explicit breaking operator, we find that the pNGB starts its motion with a sliding across rapidly decreasing potential barriers during which the baryon asymmetry is generated and frozen, and later it oscillates as dark matter. It is predicted that the pNGB mass and decay constant are around $5\,{\rm eV}$ and $3\times10^6\,{\rm GeV}$, respectively, while the radial mode has a light mass $O(10)\,{\rm MeV}$ and a small mixing $O(10^{-4})$ with the Higgs boson. Applied to the Majoron in the type-I seesaw model, the heaviest right-handed neutrino is required to be as light as $100\,{\rm GeV}$. These predictions can be tested at kaon experiments, heavy neutral lepton searches, LHC, and future colliders.</description>

      <title>SHIFT@LHC: Searches for New Physics with Shifted Interaction on a Fixed Target at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New low-mass particles with very small couplings to standard model particles that travel significant distances before decaying are interesting candidates to address some of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. In this paper, I propose to extend the LHC's research program by installing a fixed target referred to as SHIFT at around 160 meters from the CMS interaction point. When the LHC proton beam collides with this target, interactions at a center of mass energy of $\approx$113 GeV would occur. The particles produced in such collisions, or their decay products, would travel through the rock and other material on their path, potentially reaching the CMS detector where they can be registered and studied. Such an approach would allow us to access otherwise uncovered regions of parameters phase space at a relatively low cost since it does not require constructing a new detector. Various aspects such as angular and lifetime coverage or material survival probability have been studied. The results are interpreted within two new physics models, namely, the Dark Photons and the Hidden Valley scenarios, and compared with the standard proton-proton physics program of CMS. A comparison is also made with the fixed target program at LHCb, as well as parasitic detectors such as FASER or MATHUSLA. The obtained results indicate that, despite assuming just 1% of the nominal CMS luminosity to be available to SHIFT, the physics reach could be extended by a factor of more than 20, depending on the signal model parameters.</description>

      <title>Implications of NANOGrav results and UV freeze-in in a fast-expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing data reported by the NANOGrav collaboration indicates the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at a frequency $f\sim 10^{-8}~\rm Hz$. We show that a dark sector consisting of a Standard Model (SM) gauge singlet fermion $\chi$ and a singlet scalar $\phi$, both charged under a $Z_4$ symmetry, is capable of generating such a low frequency GW via strong first order phase transition (SFOPT) through the modification of the standard cosmological history, where we assume faster-than-usual expansion at pre-BBN times driven by a new cosmological species $\varphi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale factor as $\rho_\varphi\propto a^{-\left(4+n\right)}$. Depending on the choice of the fast expansion parameters, reheat temperature and effective scale of the theory, it is also possible to address correct dark matter (DM) relic abundance via freeze-in. We show that a successful first order phase transition explaining NANOGrav results together with PLANCK observed DM abundance put bound on the fast expansion parameters requiring $n\lesssim 4$ to explain both.</description>

      <title>Causality Criteria from Stability Analysis at Ultra-High Boost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have exclusively employed the linear stability analysis at ultra-high boost on two well-known stable-causal theories - second-order MIS and first-order BDNK, to identify the region of parameter space over which they are frame-invariantly stable and obey causal signal propagation. It has been shown that at near-luminal boost, stability criteria alone can provide the causality constraints on transport coefficients, which are identical to the asymptotic causality conditions, without actually going to the asymptotic limit of the theories. Thus, we present an alternative approach to derive the causality constraints, which is more appropriate for low-energy effective theories like relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A New Solution to the Callan Rubakov Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the scattering of massive fermions off of smooth, spherically symmetric monopoles in $4d$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory. We propose a complete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses all angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a monopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of the Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a dyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then protected from decay by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry, creating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can be trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which can decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved $\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can be described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert space, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov effect.</description>

      <title>Vortices, topology and time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate physical time with the topology of magnetic field vortices. We base ourselves on a formulation of unimodular gravity where the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ appears as the canonical dual to a variable which on-shell becomes four-volume time. If the theory is restricted to a topological axionic form (viz. a parity-odd product of an electric and a magnetic field), such a time variable becomes the spatial integral of the Chern-Simons density. The latter equates to helicity, so that unimodular time is transmuted into the linking number of the vortices of the topological magnetic field, times their flux. With the added {\it postulate} that this flux is a universal constant, the flow of time can thus be interpreted as the progressive weaving of further links between magnetic field vortices, each link providing a quantum of time with value related to the fixed flux. Non-abelian extensions, and targetting parameters other than $\Lambda$ are briefly examined, exposing different types of vortices and a possible role for inter-linking leading to new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Energy Dependence of Flavor Instabilities Stemming from Crossings in the Neutrino Flavor Lepton Number Angular Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino-neutrino refraction can lead to flavor conversion, if a zero-crossing is present in the neutrino flavor lepton number (FLN) angular distribution and the neutrino self-interaction strength $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_F n_\nu$ represents the characteristic timescale of the system. It has been empirically realized that the vacuum frequency $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$ affects the development of flavor conversion in the presence of zero-crossing even if $\omega \ll \mu$. Focusing on a homogeneous and axially symmetric neutrino gas, we explore the role of $\omega$ in the onset of flavor instabilities. We find that a non-zero vacuum frequency can be responsible for inducing flavor instabilities even when the neutrino self-interaction strength is much larger than the vacuum frequency. Moreover, mapping a neutrino ensemble with $\omega \neq 0$ into an effective system with $\omega =0$, we find that a system with no FLN zero-crossing can effectively develop one for $\omega \neq 0$ becoming unstable.</description>

      <title>Probing the signature of axions through the quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion-photon coupling allows the existence of a magnetically and electrically charged black hole (BH) solution endowed with a pseudo-scalar hair. For the Reissner-Nordstrom BH with a given total charge and mass, it is known that the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are independent of the mixture between the magnetic and electric charges due to the presence of electric-magnetic duality. We show that the BH with an axion hair breaks this degeneracy by realizing nontrivial QNMs that depend on the ratio between the magnetic and total charges. Thus, the upcoming observations of BH QNMs through gravitational waves offer an exciting possibility for probing the existence of both magnetic monopoles and the axion coupled to photons.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark phase transition in the neutron star with vector MIT bag model and Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU (KIDS) density functional for the hadron phase and the MIT bag model with vector (vBag) model for the quark phase, we obtain hadron-quark phase transition in neutron stars considering Maxwell construction. The structural properties of the resultant hybrid stars are computed for three different values of bag constant ($B$) in the range $B^{1/4}=$(145$-$160 MeV). We study the effects of symmetry energy ($J$) on the hybrid star properties with the different KIDS model and found that $J$ has important influence not only on the transition properties like the transition mass, transition radius and jump in density due to phase transition, but also on the stability of the hybrid stars. The vector repulsion of the quark phase via the parameter $G_V$ has profound influence in obtaining reasonable hybrid star configurations, consistent with the recent astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars. Within the aforesaid range of $B$, the value of $G_V$ is constrained to be 0.3 $\lesssim G_V \lesssim$ 0.4 in order to obtain reasonable hybrid star configurations.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black holes as dark matter using AMS-02 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during propagation in the Milky Way, potentially reaching energies up to the GeV level observed by AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ by employing the reacceleration mechanism. Under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution, our findings reveal that the limit is stricter than that derived from Voyager 1 data. This difference is particularly pronounced when $M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{15}\,{\rm g}$, exceeding an order of magnitude. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.</description>

      <title>Inverse Radon transforms: analytical and Tikhonov-like regularizations of inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for three point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for pseudo-Dirac scenario. We find that a common mass-squared-difference $\delta m^2$ for all three flavors can be constrained as $\delta m^2 \lesssim 2.2 \times 10^{-19} eV^2$ for the source NGC 1068, $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-20} eV^2$ for the source TXS 0506+056, and $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-21} eV^2$ for the source PKS 1424+240 at 90% C.L. A stacking analysis gives a constraint on $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-21} eV^2$ at 90% CL which is dominated by the constraint obtained from PKS 1424+240.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>
