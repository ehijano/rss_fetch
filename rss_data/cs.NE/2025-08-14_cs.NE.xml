      <title>Reinforcement learning in densely recurrent biological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training highly recurrent networks in continuous action spaces is a technical challenge: gradient-based methods suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients, while purely evolutionary searches converge slowly in high-dimensional weight spaces. We introduce a hybrid, derivative-free optimization framework that implements reinforcement learning by coupling global evolutionary exploration with local direct search exploitation. The method, termed ENOMAD (Evolutionary Nonlinear Optimization with Mesh Adaptive Direct search), is benchmarked on a suite of food-foraging tasks instantiated in the fully mapped neural connectome of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Crucially, ENOMAD leverages biologically derived weight priors, letting it refine--rather than rebuild--the organism's native circuitry. Two algorithmic variants of the method are introduced, which lead to either small distributed adjustments of many weights, or larger changes on a limited number of weights. Both variants significantly exceed the performance of the untrained connectome (in what can be interpreted as an example of transfer learning) and of existing training strategies. These findings demonstrate that integrating evolutionary search with nonlinear optimization provides an efficient, biologically grounded strategy for specializing natural recurrent networks towards a specified set of tasks.</description>

      <title>Event-driven Robust Fitting on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhance the machine learning algorithm performance in phishing detection with keyword features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.</description>

      <title>Counting Short Trajectories in Elementary Cellular Automata using the Transfer Matrix Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs) exhibit diverse behaviours often categorized by Wolfram's qualitative classification. To provide a quantitative basis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of such automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of all configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time steps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the CA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p, c)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging to an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such statistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection between the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1 rules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$ increases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate cycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3 rules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short transient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3 rules. This method provides a precise framework for quantifying trajectory statistics, although its exponential computational cost in $p+c$ restricts practical analysis to short trajectories.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Reality Transformer: Neural Architectures for Simulating Neurological Perception Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers, families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision, and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how neural networks can model atypical human perception.</description>

      <title>Learning Characteristics of Reverse Quaternion Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a new multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural network model architecture, Reverse Quaternion Neural Network which utilizes the non-commutative nature of quaternion products, and to clarify its learning characteristics. While quaternion neural networks have been used in various fields, there has been no research report on the characteristics of multi-layer feedforward quaternion neural networks where weights are applied in the reverse direction. This paper investigates the learning characteristics of the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network from two perspectives: the learning speed and the generalization on rotation. As a result, it is found that the Reverse Quaternion Neural Network has a learning speed comparable to existing models and can obtain a different rotation representation from the existing models.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Computing with Evolved Critical Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission, storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its robustness to extreme initial conditions.</description>

      <title>CTRQNets &amp; LQNets: Continuous Time Recurrent and Liquid Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Linear Recurrent Neural Networks for the Edge with Unstructured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural networks in real-world, resource-constrained environments.</description>
