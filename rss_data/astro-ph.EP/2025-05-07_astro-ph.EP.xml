      <title>Minimizing Star Spot Contamination of Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using Alternate Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Currie et al. simulated the detection of molecules in the atmospheres of temperate rocky exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars. They simulated detections via spectral cross-correlation applied to high resolution optical and near-IR transit spectroscopy using the ELTs. Currie et al. did not consider the effect of unocculted star spots, but we do that here for possible detections of molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. We find that confusion noise from unocculted star spots becomes significant for large programs that stack tens to hundreds of transits to detect these molecules. Noise from star spots increases with greater spot filling factors, and star spot temperature has less effect than filling factor. Nevertheless, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane could be detected in temperate rocky planets transiting nearby M-dwarfs without correcting for star spots. Water vapor detections are the most affected, with star spots contaminating the exoplanet signal as well as producing extra noise. Unocculted spots only affect transit spectroscopy when normalizing by dividing by the total flux from the star. We describe an alternate normalization method that minimizes star spot effects by deriving and implementing an unspotted proxy spectrum for the normalization. We show that the method works in principle using realistic levels of random observational noise. Alternate normalization would be broadly applicable to all types of transit spectroscopy, and we discuss challenges to applying it in practice. We also outline a comprehensive approach that has the potential to overcome those challenges.</description>

      <title>The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models. V: A Correction to the Disequilibrium Abundance of CO$_2$ for Sonora Elf Owl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To aid the interpretation of observations of substellar atmospheres, Mukherjee et al. (2024) created the Sonora Elf Owl grid of model atmospheres, simulations that accounted for disequilibrium quench chemistry. However, Sonora Elf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models quenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$ should have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e., quenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the CO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount that JWST is sensitive to. Here, we release version two of the Sonora Elf Owl grid which has corrected CO$_2$ concentrations. Additionally, in version two we remove PH$_3$ as a spectral contributor since our spectra consistently contained too much PH$_3$ absorption. The new spectra can be found as an update to the original Zenodo postings.</description>

      <title>The Eccentricity Distribution of Warm Sub-Saturns in TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the eccentricity distribution of warm sub-Saturns (4-8 Re, 8-200 day periods) as derived from an analysis of transit light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We use the "photoeccentric" effect to constrain the eccentricities of 76 planets, comprising 60 and 16 from single- and multi-transiting systems, respectively. We employ Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling to infer the eccentricity distribution of the population, testing both a Beta and Mixture Beta distribution. We identify a few highly eccentric (e ~ 0.7-0.8) warm sub-Saturns with eccentricities that appear too high to be explained by disk migration or planet-planet scattering alone, suggesting high-eccentricity migration may play a role in their formation. The majority of the population have a mean eccentricity of e = 0.103+0.047-0.045, consistent with both planet-disk and planet-planet interactions. Notably, we find that the highly eccentric sub-Saturns occur in single-transiting systems. This study presents the first evidence at the population level that the eccentricities of sub-Saturns may be sculpted by dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Dust enrichment and growth in their earliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Dust enrichment and growth during the initial stages of protoplanetary disk formation were numerically investigated. A particular objective was to determine the effects of various growth barriers, which were mimicked by setting a series of upper permissible limits on maximum dust sizes. Methods. We used the ngFEOSAD code to simulate the three-dimensional dynamics of gas and dust in the polytropic approximation starting from the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere to $\approx 12$ kyr after the first hydrostatic core and disk formation. Results. We found that dust growth starts in the contracting cloud in the evolution stage that precedes disk formation and the disk begins to form in an environment that is already enriched in grown dust. The efficiency of dust growth in the disk is limited by dust growth barriers. For dust grains with maximum size &lt; 100 $\mu$m these are likely electrostatic or bouncing barriers, and for larger grains the fragmentation and drift barriers play the major role. The disk midplane becomes quickly enriched with dust, while the vertically integrated distribution of dust shows notable local variations around the canonical 1:100 dust-to-gas mass ratio. These positive and negative deviations are likely caused by local hydrodynamic flows, since the globally integrated dust-to-gas ratio deviates negligibly from the initial 1:100 value. We note that care should be taken when considering models with a fixed dust size, as it may attain a profound negative radial gradient already in the very early stages of disk formation. Models with a constant Stokes number may be preferable in this context. Conclusions. The early dust enrichment and growth may facilitate planet formation as suggested by observations of protoplanetary disk substructures.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric loss during giant impacts: mechanisms and scaling of near- and far-field loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary epoch of planetary accretion concludes with giant impacts - highly energetic collisions between proto-planets that can play a key role in shaping a planet's inventory of volatile elements. Previous work has shown that single giant impacts have the potential to eject a significant amount of a planet's atmosphere but that the efficiency of atmospheric loss depends strongly on the impact parameters and atmospheric properties. Fully quantifying the role of giant impacts in planetary volatile evolution requires a more complete understanding of the mechanisms driving loss during impacts. Here, we use a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to show that loss in giant impacts is controlled primarily by ejecta plumes near the impact site and breakout of the impact shock in the far field, with the efficiency of the latter well approximated by 1D ground-kick calculations. The relative contributions of each mechanism to loss changes drastically with varying impact parameters. By considering the near and far field separately, we present a scaling law that precisely approximates (to within an average of $\sim$3%) loss from 0.35 to 5.0 Earth mass planets with 5% mass fraction H$_2$-He atmospheres for any combination of impactor mass, impact velocity, and angle. Finally, we apply our scaling law to the results of $N$-body simulations for different solar system formation scenarios. We find that while individual impacts rarely cause significant loss ($&gt;$10%) from roughly Earth-mass planets with such massive primary atmospheres, the cumulative effect of multiple impacts can be substantial (40-70% loss).</description>

      <title>Double Hot Jupiters Through ZLK Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism with tidal friction has been demonstrated as a promising avenue to generate hot Jupiters in stellar binary systems. Previous population studies of hot Jupiter formation have largely examined this mechanism in systems comprised of three bodies: two stars and one planet. However, because stars in a binary system form in similar environments with comparable metallicities, the formation of a single hot Jupiter in such a system may imply that the conditions are more likely met for the companion star, as well. We investigate the ZLK mechanism with tidal friction as a potential mechanism to produce double hot Jupiter systems in stellar binaries. Using N-body simulations, we characterize the evolution of two cold Jupiters, each orbiting one star in a binary system, undergoing mirrored ZLK migration. We then examine the robustness of this mechanism to asymmetries in stellar masses, planet masses, and planet orbital inclinations relative to the binary plane. We predict that, under the assumptions that (1) most hot Jupiters in binary star systems form through ZLK migration of primordially formed cold Jupiters and (2) if one star in a binary system forms a cold Jupiter, the second does as well, a comprehensive search could identify double hot Jupiters in up to ~9% of the close- to moderate- separation a&lt;2000 AU) binary systems that already host a known hot Jupiter. We also argue that a blind search for ZLK-migrated double hot Jupiters should prioritize twin stellar binaries with pericenter approaches of a few hundred AU.</description>

      <title>Collisional Fragmentation Support in TRACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improved collision support for TRACE, a state-of-the-art hybrid integrator in REBOUND. TRACE now supports collisional fragmentation and can handle both removing and adding particles mid-timestep. We describe the back-end logic implemented for robust collision support, and compare TRACE's performance to other integrators including MERCURIUS on a large-N protoplanetary disk simulation with various collision prescriptions, a system which TRACE previously could not handle. TRACE matches the behavior of these integrators, while offering potentially vast speedups of over 70x. All updates described in this Note are available with the most recent public release of REBOUND.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Investigation of HD 209458 b HST &amp; JWST Transmission Spectra with SANSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 209458 b is the first exoplanet on which an atmosphere was detected. Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. Specifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>Coverage Biases in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly used to complement traditional data collection approaches such as surveys and censuses across scientific disciplines. However, we ask: Do all places on earth benefit equally from this new wealth of information? In this study, we investigate coverage bias of major satellite constellations that provide optical satellite imagery with a ground sampling distance below 10 meters, evaluating both the future on-demand tasking opportunities as well as the availability of historic images across the globe. Specifically, forward-looking, we estimate how often different places are revisited during a window of 30 days based on the satellites' orbital paths, thus investigating potential coverage biases caused by physical factors. We find that locations farther away from the equator are generally revisited more frequently by the constellations under study. Backward-looking, we show that historic satellite image availability -- based on metadata collected from major satellite imagery providers -- is influenced by socio-economic factors on the ground: less developed, less populated places have less satellite images available. Furthermore, in three small case studies on recent conflict regions in this world, namely Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, we show that also geopolitical events play an important role in satellite image availability, hinting at underlying business model decisions. These insights lay bare that the digital dividend yielded by satellite imagery is not equally distributed across our planet.</description>

      <title>Main-oval auroral emission from a T6 brown dwarf: observations, modeling, and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a series of 5 GHz VLBA radio observations taken over 1-yr span, we present the detection of compact highly-polarized radio emission from the T6 brown dwarf WISE J112254.72+255022.2 compatible with electron cyclotron maser emission. Both the total and polarized lightcurves show variability in correspondence with a rotation period of 1.95+/-0.03 hr. Comparison with models indicates that the quasi-steady radio emission of this brown dwarf is produced in circumpolar auroral rings, with remarkable similarity to the main-oval auroras in Jupiter. We have detected a large 100% polarized flare in one of the VLBA epochs (2022.82) which may imply the existence of active longitudes in the auroral rings with a non-axisymmetric beaming cone radiation pattern, similar to the dusk/dawn asymmetries seen in the Jovian radio emissions. We also present a high-precision astrometric analysis of the sky motion of WISE J112254.72+255022.2, resulting in revised values of proper motion and parallax with an improvement in precision of one order of magnitude. The common kinematics of WISE J112254.72+255022.2 with its wide companion, the M-dwarf LHS 302, is confirmed with submilliarcsecond precision, suggesting that this brown dwarf may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of the outer part of a protostellar disc around LHS 302. The astrometric analysis imposes very tight bounds to the presence of low-mass companions around WISE J112254.72+255022.2, ruling out objects more massive than Saturn. Our results strengthen the analogy between radio emitting brown dwarfs and the magnetized planets of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Tidally Heated Sub-Neptunes, Refined Planetary Compositions, and Confirmation of a Third Planet in the TOI-1266 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-1266 is a benchmark system of two temperate ($&lt;$ 450 K) sub-Neptune-sized planets orbiting a nearby M dwarf exhibiting a rare inverted architecture with a larger interior planet. In this study, we characterize transit timing variations (TTVs) in the TOI-1266 system using high-precision ground-based follow-up and new TESS data. We confirm the presence of a third exterior non-transiting planet, TOI-1266 d (P = 32.5 d, $M_d$ = 3.68$^{+1.05}_{-1.11} M_{\oplus}$), and combine the TTVs with archival radial velocity (RV) measurements to improve our knowledge of the planetary masses and radii. We find that, consistent with previous studies, TOI-1266 b ($R_b$ = 2.52 $\pm$ 0.08 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_b$ = 4.46 $\pm$ 0.69 $M_{\oplus}$) has a low bulk density requiring the presence of a hydrogen-rich envelope, while TOI-1266 c ($R_c$ = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.10 $R_{\oplus}$, $M_c$ = 3.17 $\pm$ 0.76 $M_{\oplus}$) has a higher bulk density that can be matched by either a hydrogen-rich or water-rich envelope. Our new dynamical model reveals that this system is arranged in a rare configuration with the inner and outer planets located near the 3:1 period ratio with a non-resonant planet in between them. Our dynamical fits indicate that the inner and outer planet have significantly nonzero eccentricities ($e_b + e_d = 0.076^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$), suggesting that TOI-1266 b may have an inflated envelope due to tidal heating. Finally, we explore the corresponding implications for the formation and long-term evolution of the system, which contains two of the most favorable cool ($&lt;$ 500 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution</title>

Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $&gt;$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$1.37 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find maximal relative differences of $&gt;$200\% in total number density and $&gt;$40\% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our framework offer a simple way to take into account polydispersity with an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using a two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar age and mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>
