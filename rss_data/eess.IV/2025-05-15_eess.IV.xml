      <title>ImplicitStainer: Data-Efficient Medical Image Translation for Virtual Antibody-based Tissue Staining Using Local Implicit Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic diagnosis in pathology. However, H&amp;E staining does not capture all the diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells. While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire, leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by computationally generating IHC stains from H&amp;E stained images. Although many GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Ordered-subsets Multi-diffusion Model for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details. To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model (OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model (MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details. Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information. Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience, offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in sparse-view scenarios.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Visual Fidelity Index for Generative Semantic Communications with Critical Information Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks, which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features, the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of higher PSNR and lower FID scores.</description>

      <title>HWA-UNETR: Hierarchical Window Aggregate UNETR for 3D Multimodal Gastric Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via https://github.com/JeMing-creater/HWA-UNETR.</description>

      <title>Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.</description>

      <title>WeGA: Weakly-Supervised Global-Local Affinity Learning Framework for Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction in Rectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) assessment in rectal cancer is essential for treatment planning, yet current MRI-based evaluation shows unsatisfactory accuracy, leading to suboptimal clinical decisions. Developing automated systems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-level annotations. Previous methods treat lymph nodes as isolated entities rather than as an interconnected system, overlooking valuable spatial and contextual information. To solve this problem, we present WeGA, a novel weakly-supervised global-local affinity learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) a dual-branch architecture with DINOv2 backbone for global context and residual encoder for local node details; 2) a global-local affinity extractor that aligns features across scales through cross-attention fusion; and 3) a regional affinity loss that enforces structural coherence between classification maps and anatomical regions. Experiments across one internal and two external test centers demonstrate that WeGA outperforms existing methods, achieving AUCs of 0.750, 0.822, and 0.802 respectively. By effectively modeling the relationships between individual lymph nodes and their collective context, WeGA provides a more accurate and generalizable approach for lymph node metastasis prediction, potentially enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment selection for rectal cancer patients.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Channel Noise Adding with Adaptive Denoising for Diffusion-Based Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to convey the intended meaning of messages rather than merely transmitting bits, thereby offering greater efficiency and robustness, particularly in resource-constrained or noisy environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which is referred to as joint source-channel noise adding with adaptive denoising (JSCNA-AD) for SemCom based on a diffusion model (DM). Unlike conventional encoder-decoder designs, our approach intentionally incorporates the channel noise during transmission, effectively transforming the harmful channel noise into a constructive component of the diffusion-based semantic reconstruction process. Besides, we introduce an attention-based adaptive denoising mechanism, in which transmitted images are divided into multiple regions, and the number of denoising steps is dynamically allocated based on the semantic importance of each region. This design effectively balances the reception quality and the inference latency by prioritizing the critical semantic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing SemCom schemes under various noise conditions, underscoring the potential of diffusion-based models in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Radiogenomic Bipartite Graph Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging and genomic data offer distinct and rich features, and their integration can unveil new insights into the complex landscape of diseases. In this study, we present a novel approach utilizing radiogenomic data including structural MRI images and gene expression data, for Alzheimer's disease detection. Our framework introduces a novel heterogeneous bipartite graph representation learning featuring two distinct node types: genes and images. The network can effectively classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) into three distinct stages:AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitive Normal (CN) classes, utilizing a small dataset. Additionally, it identified which genes play a significant role in each of these classification groups. We evaluate the performance of our approach using metrics including classification accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The proposed technique holds potential for extending to radiogenomic-based classification to other diseases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel remote sensing change detection task, non-registration change detection, to address the increasing number of emergencies such as natural disasters, anthropogenic accidents, and military strikes. First, in light of the limited discourse on the issue of non-registration change detection, we systematically propose eight scenarios that could arise in the real world and potentially contribute to the occurrence of non-registration problems. Second, we develop distinct image transformation schemes tailored to various scenarios to convert the available registration change detection dataset into a non-registration version. Finally, we demonstrate that non-registration change detection can cause catastrophic damage to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanZard/NRCD.</description>

      <title>High Quality Underwater Image Compression with Adaptive Correction and Codebook-based Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world, underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images. Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods.</description>

      <title>IMITATE: Image Registration with Context for unknown time frame recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Kheil-Z/IMITATE .</description>

      <title>Cyclic 2.5D Perceptual Loss for Cross-Modal 3D Medical Image Synthesis: T1w MRI to Tau PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a demand for medical image synthesis or translation to generate synthetic images of missing modalities from available data. This need stems from challenges such as restricted access to high-cost imaging devices, government regulations, or failure to follow up with patients or study participants. In medical imaging, preserving high-level semantic features is often more critical than achieving pixel-level accuracy. Perceptual loss functions are widely employed to train medical image synthesis or translation models, as they quantify differences in high-level image features using a pre-trained feature extraction network. While 3D and 2.5D perceptual losses are used in 3D medical image synthesis, they face challenges, such as the lack of pre-trained 3D models or difficulties in balancing loss reduction across different planes. In this work, we focus on synthesizing 3D tau PET images from 3D T1-weighted MR images. We propose a cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss that sequentially computes the 2D average perceptual loss for each of the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes over epochs, with the cycle duration gradually decreasing. Additionally, we process tau PET images using by-manufacturer standardization to enhance the preservation of high-SUVR regions indicative of tau pathology and mitigate SUVR variability caused by inter-manufacturer differences. We combine the proposed loss with SSIM and MSE losses and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving both quantitative and qualitative performance across various generative models, including U-Net, UNETR, SwinUNETR, CycleGAN, and Pix2Pix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.</description>

      <title>A Trust-Guided Approach to MR Image Reconstruction with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from sparse k-space data, via an ill-posed or ill-conditioned linear inverse problem (LIP). To address the resulting ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge into the optimization problem, e.g., in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is the readily available auxiliary data (a.k.a. side information) obtained from sources other than the current acquisition. In this paper, we present the Trust- Guided Variational Network (TGVN), an end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively and reliably integrates side information into LIPs. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, where incomplete or low-SNR measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. TGVN is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines utilizing side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality while preserving subtle pathological features even at challenging acceleration levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations. Source code and dataset splits are available on github.com/sodicksonlab/TGVN.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning (DL) approaches have shown remarkable success, they traditionally rely on fully-sampled ground truth (GT) images, which are expensive or impossible to obtain in real scenarios. This problem has created a recent surge in interest in self-supervised learning methods that do not require GT. Although recent methods are now fast approaching "oracle" supervised performance, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups are hindering targeted methodological research and precluding widespread trustworthy industry adoption. We present SSIBench, a modular and flexible comparison framework to unify and thoroughly benchmark Self-Supervised Imaging methods (SSI) without GT. We evaluate 18 methods across 4 realistic MRI scenarios on real data, showing a wide performance landscape whose method ranking differs across scenarios and metrics, exposing the need for further SSI research. Our insights also show how complementary methods could be compounded for future improvements, exemplified by a novel loss we propose, Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging. To accelerate reproducible research and lower the barrier to entry, we provide the extensible benchmark and open-source reimplementations of all methods at https://andrewwango.github.io/ssibench, allowing researchers to rapidly and fairly contribute and evaluate new methods on the standardised setup for potential leaderboard ranking, or benchmark existing methods on custom datasets, forward operators, or models, unlocking the application of SSI to other valuable GT free domains such as 4D MRI and other nascent scientific imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>A portable diagnosis model for Keratoconus using a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disorder that results in blurry and distorted vision. Traditional diagnostic tools, while effective, are often bulky, costly, and require professional operation. In this paper, we present a portable and innovative methodology for diagnosing. Our proposed approach first captures the image reflected on the eye's cornea when a smartphone screen-generated Placido disc sheds its light on an eye, then utilizes a two-stage diagnosis for identifying the KC cornea and pinpointing the location of the KC on the cornea. The first stage estimates the height and width of the Placido disc extracted from the captured image to identify whether it has KC. In this KC identification, k-means clustering is implemented to discern statistical characteristics, such as height and width values of extracted Placido discs, from non-KC (control) and KC-affected groups. The second stage involves the creation of a distance matrix, providing a precise localization of KC on the cornea, which is critical for efficient treatment planning. The analysis of these distance matrices, paired with a logistic regression model and robust statistical analysis, reveals a clear distinction between control and KC groups. The logistic regression model, which classifies small areas on the cornea as either control or KC-affected based on the corresponding inter-disc distances in the distance matrix, reported a classification accuracy of 96.94%, which indicates that we can effectively pinpoint the protrusion caused by KC. This comprehensive, smartphone-based method is expected to detect KC and streamline timely treatment.</description>

      <title>BiECVC: Gated Diversification of Bidirectional Contexts for Learned Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames. Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead. To model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating, inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2 under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64, respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/JiangWeibeta/ECVC.</description>

      <title>Measuring Student Behavioral Engagement using Histogram of Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel technique for measuring behavioral engagement through students' actions recognition. The proposed approach recognizes student actions then predicts the student behavioral engagement level. For student action recognition, we use human skeletons to model student postures and upper body movements. To learn the dynamics of student upper body, a 3D-CNN model is used. The trained 3D-CNN model is used to recognize actions within every 2minute video segment then these actions are used to build a histogram of actions which encodes the student actions and their frequencies. This histogram is utilized as an input to SVM classifier to classify whether the student is engaged or disengaged. To evaluate the proposed framework, we build a dataset consisting of 1414 2-minute video segments annotated with 13 actions and 112 video segments annotated with two engagement levels. Experimental results indicate that student actions can be recognized with top 1 accuracy 83.63% and the proposed framework can capture the average engagement of the class.</description>
