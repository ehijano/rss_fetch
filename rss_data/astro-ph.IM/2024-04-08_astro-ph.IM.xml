      <title>Multi-purpose InSTRument for Astronomy at Low-resolution: MISTRAL@OHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MISTRAL is the new Faint Object Spectroscopic Camera mounted at the folded Cassegrain focus of the 1.93m telescope of Haute-Provence Observatory. We describe the design and components of the instrument and give some details about its operation. We emphasise in particular the various observing modes and the performances of the detector. A short description is also given about the working environment. Various types of objects, including stars, nebulae, comets, novae, galaxies have been observed during various test phases to evaluate the performances of the instrument. The instrument covers the range of 4000 to 8000A with the blue setting, or from 6000 to 10000A with the red setting, at an average spectral resolution of 700. Its peak efficiency is about 22% at 6000A. In spectroscopy, a limiting magnitude of 19.5 can be achieved for a point source in one hour with a signal to noise of 3 in the continuum (and better if emission lines are present). In imaging mode, limiting magnitudes of 20-21 can be obtained in 10-20mn (with average seing conditions of 2.5 arcsec at OHP). The instrument is very users-friendly and can be put into operations in less than 15mn (rapid change-over from the other instrument in use) if required by the science (like for Gamma-Rays Bursts). Some first scientific results are described for various types of objects, and in particular for the follow-up of GRBs. While some further improvements are still under way, in particular to ease the switch from blue to red setting and add more grisms or filters, MISTRAL is ready for the follow-up of transients and other variable objects, in the soon-to-come era of e.g. the SVOM satellite and of the Rubin telescope.</description>

      <title>FarView: An In-Situ Manufactured Lunar Far Side Radio Array Concept for 21-cm Dark Ages Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FarView is an early-stage concept for a large, low-frequency radio observatory, manufactured in-situ on the lunar far side using metals extracted from the lunar regolith. It consists of 100,000 dipole antennas in compact subarrays distributed over a large area but with empty space between subarrays in a core-halo structure. FarView covers a total area of ~200 km2, has a dense core within the inner ~36 km2, and a ~power-law falloff of antenna density out to ~14 km from the center. With this design, it is relatively easy to identify multiple viable build sites on the lunar far side. The science case for FarView emphasizes the unique capabilities to probe the unexplored Cosmic Dark Ages - identified by the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey as the discovery area for cosmology. FarView will deliver power spectra and tomographic maps tracing the evolution of the Universe from before the birth of the first stars to the beginning of Cosmic Dawn, and potentially provide unique insights into dark matter, early dark energy, neutrino masses, and the physics of inflation. What makes FarView feasible and affordable in the timeframe of the 2030s is that it is manufactured in-situ, utilizing space industrial technologies. This in-situ manufacturing architecture utilizes Earth-built equipment that is transported to the lunar surface to extract metals from the regolith and will use those metals to manufacture most of the array components: dipole antennas, power lines, and silicon solar cell power systems. This approach also enables a long functional lifetime, by permitting servicing and repair of the observatory. The full 100,000 dipole FarView observatory will take 4 - 8 years to build, depending on the realized performance of the manufacturing elements and the lunar delivery scenario.</description>

      <title>PASO -- Astronomy and Space Situational Awareness in a Dark Sky Destination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pampilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO) is located in the center of the continental Portuguese territory, in the heart of a certified Dark Sky destination by the Starlight Foundation (Aldeias do Xisto) and has been an instrumental asset to advance science, education and astrotourism certifications. PASO hosts astronomy and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities including a node of the Portuguese Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (SST) infrastructure network, such as a space radar currently in test phase using GEM radiotelescope, a double Wide Field of View Telescope system, a EUSST optical sensor telescope. These instruments allow surveillance of satellite and space debris in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits. The WFOV telescope offers spectroscopy capabilities enabling light curve analysis and cosmic sources monitoring. Instruments for Space Weather are being considered for installation to monitor solar activities and expand the range of SSA services.</description>

      <title>A new semi-coherent targeted search for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-coherent targeted search method for continuous gravitational waves (CW) emitted by pulsars in binary systems. The method is based on a custom optimization of the coherence time according to the orbital parameters and their uncertainties, as provided by electromagnetic observations. While rotating pulsars are expected to produce quasi-monochromatic CWs in their reference frame, their orbital motion introduces an additional modulation in the observer frame, alongside the one due to the Earth's motion. As a result, the received signal is dispersed across a frequency range and corrections, aimed at removing the orbital modulation, are therefore required to achieve detection. However, Doppler corrections can, in some cases, significantly vary within the uncertainties with which orbital parameters are known. In order to optimally exploit the constraints drawn from electromagnetic observations we implement a semi-coherent search, more robust than fully coherent methods, in which the coherence time is evaluated for each source taking into account uncertainties in its orbital parameters. This method was tested and applied to a set of twelve targets from the ATNF catalogue. The search identified a single outlier which astrophysical origin has been confidently excluded. For the first time to our knowledge, we then set upper limits on the signal strain from these 12 pulsars, the lowest being $h_{UL}\sim1.06\cdot10^{-25}$ for PSR J1326-4728B.</description>

      <title>Derivative Spectroscopy and its Application at Detecting the Weak Emission/Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic survey telescopes like Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Sloan Digital Sky Survey has opened up unprecedented opportunities for stellar classification. Specific types of stars, such as early-type emission-line stars and those with stellar winds, can be distinguished by the profiles of their spectral lines. In this paper, we introduce a method based on derivative spectroscopy (DS) designed to detect signals within complex backgrounds and provide a preliminary estimation of curve profiles. This method exhibits a unique advantage in identifying weak signals and unusual spectral line profiles when compared to other popular line detection methods. We validated our approach using synthesis spectra, demonstrating that DS can detect emission signals three times fainter than Gaussian fitting. Furthermore, we applied our method to 579,680 co-added spectra from LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey, identifying 16,629 spectra with emission peaks around the H{\alpha} line from 10,963 stars. These spectra were classified into three distinct morphological groups, resulting in nine subclasses as follows. (1) Emission peak above the pseudo-continuum line (single peak, double peaks, emission peak situated within an absorption line, P Cygni profile, Inverse P Cygni profile); (2) Emission peak below the pseudo-continuum line (sharp emission peak, double absorption peaks, emission peak shifted to one side of the absorption line); (3) Emission peak between the pseudo-continuum line.</description>

      <title>Constraining stellar tidal quality factors from planet-induced stellar spin-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{tdescore}$: An Accurate Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical surveys have become increasingly adept at identifying candidate Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in large numbers, but classifying these generally requires extensive spectroscopic resources. Here we present $\texttt{tdescore}$, a simple binary photometric classifier that is trained using a systematic census of $\sim$3000 nuclear transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The sample is highly imbalanced, with TDEs representing $\sim$2% of the total. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is nonetheless able to reject non-TDEs with 99.6% accuracy, yielding a sample of probable TDEs with recall of 77.5% for a precision of 80.2%. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is thus substantially better than any available TDE photometric classifier scheme in the literature, with performance not far from spectroscopy as a method for classifying ZTF nuclear transients, despite relying solely on ZTF data and multi-wavelength catalogue cross-matching. In a novel extension, we use `SHapley Additive exPlanations' ($\texttt{SHAP}$) to provide a human-readable justification for each individual $\texttt{tdescore}$ classification, enabling users to understand and form opinions about the underlying classifier reasoning. $\texttt{tdescore}$ can serve as a model for photometric identification of TDEs with time-domain surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin observatory.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Rapid Exploration in Close-Proximity of an Asteroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of space missions may overwhelm ground support infrastructure, prompting the need for autonomous deep-space guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&amp;C) systems. These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GN\&amp;C for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.</description>

      <title>Curvature in the very-high energy gamma-ray spectrum of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radio galaxy M87 is a variable very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, exhibiting three major flares reported in 2005, 2008, and 2010. Despite extensive studies, the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the VHE gamma-ray spectrum of M87 during states of high gamma-ray activity, utilizing 20.2$\,$ hours the H.E.S.S. observations. Our findings indicate a preference for a curved spectrum, characterized by a log-parabola model with extra-galactic background light (EBL) model above 0.3$\,$TeV at the 4$\sigma$ level, compared to a power-law spectrum with EBL. We investigate the degeneracy between the absorption feature and the EBL normalization and derive upper limits on EBL models mainly sensitive in the wavelength range 12.4$\,$$\mu$m - 40$\,$$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilities, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>
