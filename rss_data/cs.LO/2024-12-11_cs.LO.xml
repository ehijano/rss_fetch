      <title>The Complexity of HyperQPTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HyperQPTL and HyperQPTL$^+$ are expressive specification languages for hyperproperties, i.e., properties that relate multiple executions of a system. Tight complexity bounds are known for HyperQPTL finite-state satisfiability and model-checking.
  Here, we settle the complexity of satisfiability for HyperQPTL as well as satisfiability, finite-state satisfiability, and model-checking for HyperQPTL$^+$: the former is equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic, the latter are all equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic, i.e., they are all four very undecidable.</description>

      <title>An Abstract Account of Up-to Techniques for Inductive Behavioural Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Up-to techniques' represent enhancements of the coinduction proof method and are widely used on coinductive behavioural relations such as bisimilarity. Abstract formulations of these coinductive techniques exist, using fixed-points or category theory. A proposal has been recently put forward  for transporting the enhancements onto the concrete realms of inductive behavioural relations, i.e., relations defined from inductive observables, such as traces or enriched forms of traces. The abstract meaning of such 'inductive enhancements', however, has not been explored. In this paper, we review the theory, and then propose an abstract account of it, using fixed-point theory in complete lattices.</description>

      <title>Developing a Dataset-Adaptive, Normalized Metric for Machine Learning Model Assessment: Integrating Size, Complexity, and Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and precision are frequently used to evaluate machine learning models, however they may not be sufficient for evaluating performance on tiny, unbalanced, or high-dimensional datasets. A dataset-adaptive, normalized metric that incorporates dataset characteristics like size, feature dimensionality, class imbalance, and signal-to-noise ratio is presented in this study. Early insights into the model's performance potential in challenging circumstances are provided by the suggested metric, which offers a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework. The metric's capacity to accurately forecast model scalability and performance is demonstrated via experimental validation spanning classification, regression, and clustering tasks, guaranteeing solid assessments in settings with limited data. This method has important ramifications for effective resource allocation and model optimization in machine learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Proceedings 17th Interaction and Concurrency Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of ICE'24, the 17th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held on Friday 21th June 2024 at the University of Groningen in Groningen, The Netherlands, as a satellite workshop of DisCoTec 2024. The ICE workshop series features a distinguishing review and selection procedure: PC members are encouraged to interact, anonymously, with authors. The 2024 edition of ICE included double blind reviewing of original research papers, in order to increase fairness and avoid bias in reviewing. Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether 3 papers were accepted for publication plus 1 oral communication, which was accepted for presentation at the workshop.  We were proud to host one invited talk, by Jorge A. P\'erez. The abstract of his talk is included in this volume, together with the final versions of the research papers, which take into account the discussion at the workshop and during the review process.</description>

      <title>On the Home-Space Problem for Petri Nets and its Ackermannian Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02697v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of configurations $H$ is a home-space for a set of configurations $X$ of aPetri net if every configuration reachable from (any configuration in) $X$ can reach (some configuration in) $H$. The semilinear home-space problem for Petri nets asks, given a Petri net and semilinear sets of configurations $X$, $H$, if $H$ is a home-space for $X$. In 1989, David de Frutos Escrig and Colette Johnen proved that the problem is decidable when $X$ is a singleton and $H$ is a finite union of linear sets with the same periods. In this paper, we show that the general (semilinear) problem is decidable. This result is obtained by proving a duality between the reachability problem and the non-home-space problem. In particular, we prove that for any Petri net and any semilinear set of configurations $H$ we can effectively compute a semilinear set $C$ of configurations, called a non-reachability core for $H$, such that for every set $X$ the set $H$ is not a home-space for $X$ if, and only if, $C$ is reachable from $X$. We show that the established relation to the reachability problem yields the Ackermann-completeness of the (semilinear) home-space problem. For this we also show that, given a Petri net with an initial marking, the set of minimal reachable markings can be constructed in Ackermannian time.</description>

      <title>How hard can it be? Quantifying MITRE attack campaigns with attack trees and cATM logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of cyber threats grows more complex by the day. Advanced Persistent Threats carry out attack campaigns - e.g. operations Dream Job, Wocao, and WannaCry - against which cybersecurity practitioners must defend. To prioritise which of these to defend against, cybersecurity experts must be equipped with the right toolbox to evaluate the most threatening ones. In particular, they would strongly benefit from (a) an estimation of the likelihood values for each attack recorded in the wild, and (b) transparently operationalising these values to compare campaigns quantitatively. Security experts could then perform transparent and accountable quantitatively-informed decisions. Here we construct such a framework: (1) quantifying the likelihood of attack campaigns via data-driven procedures on the MITRE knowledge-base, (2) introducing a methodology for automatic modelling of MITRE intelligence data, that captures any attack campaign via template attack tree models, and (3) proposing an open-source tool to perform these comparisons based on the cATM logic. Finally, we quantify the likelihood of all MITRE Enterprise campaigns, and compare the likelihood of the Wocao and Dream Job MITRE campaigns - generated with our proposed approach - against manually-built attack tree models. We demonstrate how our methodology is substantially lighter in modelling effort, and capable of capturing all the quantitative relevant data.</description>
