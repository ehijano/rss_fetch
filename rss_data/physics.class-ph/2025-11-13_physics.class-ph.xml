      <title>A surrogate-based approach to accelerate the design and build phases of reinforced concrete bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating uncertainties in the design process of reinforced concrete rail bridges, in a fully probabilistic framework, makes their design more complex and challenging. To propagate these uncertainties and convey their influence on the performance of the engineering system, a high-dimensional design space is supposed to be explored. A great challenge to be considered here lies in the computational burden as conducting such an exploration campaign requires substantial calls to computationally expensive finite element simulations. To address this challenge, a surrogate model mapping the design space to the reinforced concrete bridge performance functions is developed in the context of an active learning algorithm. The importance of this model lies in its ability to explore as many design scenarios as possible with minimal computational resources and classify the design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios. This work considers a 4-span reinforced concrete bridge deck. A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Topics in Continuum Mechanics: Grand Ideas, Errors &amp; Horrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortly after the middle of the past century, a comprehensive presentation of Continuum Mechanics was written under supervision of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell III in two volumes of Siegfried Fluegge's Handbuch der Physik, a first in 1960 with Richard Toupin on The Classical Field Theories (the monster), including an Appendix on Tensor Analysis by Jerald LaVerne Ericksen, and a second volume in 1965 with Walter Noll on The Non-Linear Field Theories of Mechanics (the monsterino). Both nicknames are due to Truesdell. These contributions were gradually taken as turning points by the Mechanics Community worldwide, due to completeness of analysis and profoundness of documentation. Vastness of treatment acted however as a shield to careful reasoning on delicate but basilar notions which, in the wake of some scholars of the XIX century, were taken to be worthy of belief and incorporated in the presentation with a valuable historical background. Lack of engineering perspective didn't favour the necessary caution to be taken in facing a number of issues. Scholars in Continuum Mechanics, fascinated by the monumental work conceived and carried out by Truesdell and associates, did not dare any accurate revision. The analysis is here centred on unsatisfactory formulations presently disseminated in literature by followers of such authoritative treatment as Truesdell's opus magnum. The geometric approach in 4D Euclid spacetime adopted here is self-proposing even in classical context and provides clarity of notions, methods and results not achievable by the more familiar but less powerful and prone to confusing 3D treatment.</description>
