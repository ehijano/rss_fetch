      <title>Drying of soft colloidal films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films made of deformable micro- and nano-units, such as biological membranes, polymer interfaces, and particle-laden liquid surfaces, exhibit a complex behavior during drying, with consequences for various applications like wound healing, coating technologies, and additive manufacturing. Studying the drying dynamics and structural changes of soft colloidal films thus holds the potential to yield valuable insights to achieve improvements for applications. In this study, we employ interfacial monolayers of core-shell microgels with varying degrees of softness as model systems and investigate their drying behavior on differently modified solid substrates (hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic). By leveraging on video microscopy, particle tracking, and thin film interference, we shed light on the interplay between microgel adhesion to solid surfaces and the immersion capillary forces that arise in the thin liquid film. We discovered that a dried replica of the interfacial microstructure can be more accurately achieved on a hydrophobic substrate relative to a hydrophilic one, particularly when employing softer colloids as opposed to harder counterparts. These observations are qualitatively supported by experiments with a thin film pressure balance which allows mimicking and controlling the drying process and by computer simulations with coarse-grained models.</description>

      <title>Analytical expressions for the two basic modes of surface displacement and overall deformation of a free-standing or elastically embedded sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating by analytical theory the deformation of finite-sized elastic bodies in response to internally applied forces is a challenge. Here, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the amplitudes of modes of surface deformation of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic sphere. The modes under consideration correspond to overall changes in volume and to relative uniaxial elongation or contraction. Both situations of an elastic sphere embedded under no-slip conditions in a linearly elastic, homogeneous, isotropic, infinitely extended background medium and of a free-standing elastic sphere are considered. For example, our analytical expressions are important as a basis for computational material optimization in the context of spherical soft actuators.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of the crystal structures from three-dimensional real-space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure detection from the real-space analysis only is still a big challenge in multiple disciplines due to the absence of exact analytical or computational methods. New types of complex crystal structures seek more involvement of advanced techniques and understandings as well as developing new kinds of machinery. Despite the existence of proper experimental techniques of crystal structure detection, it lacks the exact approach to obtain the complete unit cell information from the three dimensional coordinates only. In this research, we propose an exact prescription to detect the crystal structures in real-space based on the arrangements of the local environment and by searching for the directions of possible translational vectors. The protocol yields good agreements with the experimental results for any simple or complex crystal structures irrespective of the single-component or multi-component systems allowing the complete execution to take a minimal time and computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithmic prescription can be applied to detect the unit cell of crystal structure and identify the space group across the domains of condensed matter physics and material sciences.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and stability of orientationally ordered collective motions of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered, collective motions commonly arise spontaneously in systems of many interacting, active units, ranging from cellular tissues and bacterial colonies to self-propelled colloids and animal flocks. Active phases are especially rich when the active units are sufficiently anisotropic to produce liquid crystalline order and thus active nematic phenomena, with important biophysical examples provided by cytoskeletal filaments including microtubules and actin. Gliding assay experiments have provided a testbed to study the collective motions of these cytoskeletal filaments and unlocked diverse collective active phases, including states with long-range orientational order. However, it is not well-understood how such long-range order emerges from the interplay of passive and active aligning mechanisms. We use Brownian dynamics simulations to study the collective motions of semiflexible filaments that self-propel in quasi-two dimensions, in order to gain insights into the aligning mechanisms at work in these gliding assay systems. We find that, without aligning torques in the microscopic model, long-range orientational order can only be achieved when the filaments are able to overlap. The symmetry (nematic or polar) of the long-range order that first emerges is shown to depend on the energy cost of filament overlap and on filament flexibility. However, our model also predicts that a long-range-ordered active nematic state is merely transient, whereas long-range polar order is the only active dynamical steady state in systems with finite filament rigidity.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular separations of a binary mixture under van der Waals confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the dynamics of a binary mixture confined within van der Waals (vdW) walls using molecular dynamics simulations. We discovered a novel phenomenon named perpendicular separations of two phases (PSTP). In the initial stage, central water molecules diffused, subsequently condensing symmetrically within the confinement's mid-plane. In the later stage, as water droplets nucleate and grow, the resin separates perpendicularly into two films due to the action of bubblers and vdW walls, resulting in a hollow nanochannel. The mechanisms and conditions underlying PSTS are discussed. The results indicate that the concentration (C) of resin in the middle region is linearly decreased with temporal power. We propose a new mechanism for stabilizing nanochannels and films: dynamic "soft pillars" that prevent Rayleigh-like instability. Our findings could shed light on the manufacture of nanofilms and organic nanochannels, which could help advance bio-detection and energy fields.</description>

      <title>A Simple Tensorial Theory of Smectic C Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The smectic C (smC) phase represents a unique class of liquid crystal phases characterised by the layered arrangement of molecules with tilted orientations with respect to layer normals. Building upon the real-valued tensorial smectic A (smA) model in [Xia et al., PRL, 126, 177801 (2021)], we propose a new continuum mathematical model for smC (and smA) by introducing a novel coupling term between the real tensor containing orientational information and density variation, to control the tilt angle between directors and the layer normal (the tilt angle is zero for smA and nonzero for smC). To validate our proposed model, we conduct a series of two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments that account for typical structures in smectics: chevron patterns, defects, dislocations and toroidal focal conic domains (TFCDs). These results also reveal the phenomenological differences between smA and smC configurations.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Thermo-Osmosis: Enhanced Effects on Polarized Graphene Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermo-osmotic flows, generated by applying a thermal gradient along a liquid-solid interface, could be harnessed to convert waste heat into electricity. While this phenomenon has been known for almost a century, there is a crucial need to gain a better understanding of the molecular origins of thermo-osmosis. In this paper, we start by detailing the multiple contributions to thermo-osmosis. We then showcase three approaches to compute the thermo-osmotic coefficient using molecular dynamics; a first method based on the computation of the interfacial enthalpy excess and Derjaguin's theoretical framework, a second approach based on the computation of the interfacial entropy excess using the so-called dry-surface method, and a novel non-equilibrium method to compute the thermo-osmotic coefficient in a periodic channel. We show that the three methods align with each other, in particular for smooth surfaces. In addition, for a polarized graphene-water interface, we observe large variations of thermo-osmotic responses, and multiple changes in flow direction with increasing surface charge. Overall, this study showcases the versatility of osmotic flows and calls for experimental investigation of thermo-osmotic behavior in the vicinity of charged surfaces.</description>

      <title>Escaping kinetic traps using non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic traps are a notorious problem in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where temperature quenches ultimately fail to bring the system to low energy configurations. Using multifarious self-assembly as a model system, we introduce a mechanism to escape kinetic traps by utilizing non-reciprocal interactions between components. Introducing non-equilibrium effects offered by broken action-reaction symmetry in the system, we can push the trajectory of the system out of arrested dynamics. The dynamics of the model is studied using tools from the physics of interfaces and defects. Our proposal can find applications in self-assembly, glassy systems and systems with arrested dynamics.</description>
