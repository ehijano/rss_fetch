      <title>$L^q$-spectrum of graph-directed self-similar measures that have overlaps and are essentially of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For self-similar measures with overlaps, closed formulas of the $L^q$-spectrum have been obtained by Ngai and the author for measures that are essentially of finite type in [J. Aust. Math. Soc. \textbf{106} (2019), 56--103]. We extend the results of Ngai and the author \cite{Ngai-Xie_2019} to the graph-directed self-similar measures. For graph-directed self-similar measures satisfying the graph open set condition, the $L^q$-spectrum has been studied by Edgar and Mauldin \cite{Edgar-Mauldin_1992}. The main novelty of our results is that the graph-directed self-similar measures we consider do not need to satisfy the graph open set condition. For graph-directed self-similar measures $\mu$ on $\R^d$ ($d\ge1$), which could have overlaps but are essentially of finite type, we set up a framework for deriving a closed formula for the $L^q$-spectrum of $\mu$ for $q\ge 0$, and prove the differentiability of the $L^q$-spectrum. This framework allows us to include graph-directed self-similar measures that are strongly connected and not strongly connected and those in higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Uniform stability for the Hochstadt-Lieberman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniform stability of the Hochstadt-Lieberman problem, which consists in the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville potential on a half-interval from the spectrum and the known potential on the other half-interval. For this purpose, we reduce the half-inverse problem to the complete one for the unknown potential. Our method relies on the uniform stability for the direct and inverse Sturm-Liouville problems, for recovering sine-type functions from their zeros, and the uniform boundedness of Riesz bases of sines and cosines.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with non-local singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study a family of self-adjoint realizations of the Laplacian in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with a new type of transmission conditions along a closed bi-Lipschitz curve $\Sigma$. These conditions incorporate jumps in the Dirichlet traces both of the functions in the operator domains and of their Wirtinger derivatives and are non-local. Constructing a convenient generalized boundary triple, they may be parametrized by all compact hermitian operators in $L^2(\Sigma;\mathbb{C}^2)$. Whereas for all choices of parameters the essential spectrum is stable and equal to $[0, +\infty)$, the discrete spectrum exhibits diverse behaviour. While in many cases it is finite, we will describe also a class of parameters for which the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates at $-\infty$. The latter class contains a non-local version of the oblique transmission conditions. Finally, we will connect the current model to its relativistic counterpart studied recently in [L. Heriban, M. Tu\v{s}ek: Non-local relativistic $\delta$-shell interactions].</description>

      <title>On the perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators with separate resonant embedded eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Schr\"odinger operators on $L^2(0,\infty)$ given by
  \begin{align}
  Hu=(H_0+V)u=-u^{\prime\prime}+V_0u+Vu=Eu,\nonumber
  \end{align}
  where $V_0$ is real, $1$-periodic and $V$ is the perturbation. It is well known that under perturbations $V(x)=o(1)$ as $x\to\infty$, the essential spectrum of $H$ coincides with the essential spectrum of $H_0$. We introduce a new way to construct $C^\infty$ oscillatory decaying perturbations. In particular, we can construct $C^\infty$ perturbations with resonant embedded eigenvalues from the same spectral band and large separate spectral bands.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Introduction to graph theory and basic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book collects the lectures about graph theory and its applications which were given to students of mathematical departments of Moscow State University and Peking University. Graph theory is a very wide field with a lot of applications in almost every scientific area: in many branches of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and also in psychology, arts, philosophy and many others. Nowadays, graph theory becomes especially more important because of the rapid development of molecular biology, neural networks and AI fields. One of the aims of writing this book was to give students thorough knowledge about graphs to understand modern scientific fields more deeply. Here we tried to give classical and modern theorems and algorithms in more understandable and simple way. We spent many time to rewrite them and close the gaps in several simplest well-known proofs to provide more precise and accurate material for students.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of random regular graphs: Chebyshev polynomials, non-backtracking walks, and unitary-color extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts. This result is derived by generalizing a formula of Friedman involving Chebyshev polynomials and non-backtracking walks. We also extend a criterion of Sodin on the convergence of graph spectral measures to regular graphs of growing degree. As a result, we show that for a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, if $q_n = n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, the normalized spectral measure converges almost surely in $p$-Wasserstein distance to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1, \infty)$. This strengthens a result of Dumitriu and Pal. Many of the results are extended to unitary-colored regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Discrete trace formulas and holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrix of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrices on possibly infinite regular graphs. More precisely, we show an expansion of $h(A)$ in terms of non-backtracking matrices, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $h$ is a holomorphic function on the interior of a particular ellipse containing the spectrum of $A$. Furthermore, we prove related trace formulas for regular graphs. Our results provide a simple and direct approach to the study of resolvent, heat and Schr\"odinger equations, Ihara zeta functions, and combinatorial enumeration problems on regular graphs.</description>
