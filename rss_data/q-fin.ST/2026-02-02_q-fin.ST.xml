      <title>Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO): Overparameterized RLS for Online Learning in Non-stationary Time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overparameterized models have recently challenged conventional learning theory by exhibiting improved generalization beyond the interpolation limit, a phenomenon known as benign overfitting. This work introduces Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO), extending the recursive least-squares (RLS) framework to this regime through a numerically stable formulation based on orthogonal-triangular updates. A QR-based exponentially weighted RLS (QR-EWRLS) algorithm is introduced, combining random Fourier feature mappings with forgetting-factor regularization to enable online adaptation under non-stationary conditions. The orthogonal decomposition prevents the numerical divergence associated with covariance-form RLS while retaining adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experiments on nonlinear synthetic time series confirm that the proposed approach maintains bounded residuals and stable condition numbers while reproducing the double-descent behavior characteristic of overparameterized models. Applications to forecasting foreign exchange and electricity demand show that ABO is highly accurate (comparable to baseline kernel methods) while achieving speed improvements of between 20 and 40 percent. The results provide a unified view linking adaptive filtering, kernel approximation, and benign overfitting within a stable online learning framework.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>
