      <title>Waring decompositions of special binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the Waring rank of homogeneous polynomials of the form $x^ky^kz^k + \ell^{3k}$ where $\ell$ is a linear form. The result is based on the study of the Hilbert function and the resolution of special configurations of points in $\mathbb{P}^2$. As a byproduct of our result, we show that the monomial $x^ky^kz^k$ does not have irredundant decompositions of length $(k+1)^2 +1$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of projective varieties beyond varieties of minimal degree and del Pezzo varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Varieties of minimal degree and del Pezzo varieties are basic objects in projective algebraic geometry. Those varieties have been characterized and classified for a long time in many aspects. Motivated by the question "which varieties are the most basic and simplest except the above two kinds of varieties in view of geometry and syzygies?", we give an upper bound of the graded Betti numbers in the quadratic strand and characterize the extremal cases.
  The extremal varieties of dimension $n$, codimension $e$, and degree $d$ are exactly characterized by the following two types: (i) varieties with $d = e+2$, $\operatorname{depth} X =n$, and Green-Lazarsfeld index $a(X)=0$, (ii) arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay varieties with $d = e+3$. This is a generalization of G. Castelnuovo, G. Fano, and E. Park's results on the number of quadrics and an extension of the characterizations of varieties of minimal degree and del Pezzo varieties in view of linear syzygies of quadrics due to K. Han and S. Kwak.
  In addition, we show that every variety $X$ that belongs to (i) or (ii) is always contained in a unique rational normal scroll $Y$ as a divisor. Also, we describe the divisor class of $X$ in $Y$.</description>

      <title>Cartier duality via Mittag-Leffler modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the Cartier duality equivalence for affine commutative group schemes $G$ whose coordinate ring is a flat Mittag-Leffler module over an arbitrary base ring $R$. The dual $G^\vee$ of $G$ turns out to be an ind-finite ind-scheme over $R$. When $R$ is Noetherian and admits a dualizing complex, we construct a Fourier-Mukai transform between quasicoherent derived categories of $G$ and of $BG^\vee$ and also between those of $G^\vee$ and $BG$.</description>

      <title>Stable cohomology of universal character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the universal PGL_n$character variety over M_g whose fiber over a point [C] is the space of PGL_n-local systems on the curve C. We use nonabelian Hodge theory and properties of Saito's mixed Hodge modules to show that the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for the projection to M_g degenerates at E_2. As an application, we prove that the rational cohomology of these varieties stabilizes as g goes to infinity and compute the stable limit. We also deduce similar results for the universal G-character variety over M_{g,1} whose fiber over a punctured curve is the variety of G-local systems with fixed central monodromy around the puncture, for G = GL_n or SL_n.</description>

      <title>Hodge numbers of a Fano eightfold of K3 type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit semistable degeneration of a Fano eightfold of index three and deduce its Hodge numbers, in particular we show that it has Picard rank one. The Fano variety is of K3 type and it is defined as a connected component of the fixed locus of a suitable antisymplectic involution on a projective variety that is deformation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme of eight points on a K3 surface. We also obtain a description of a projective model of the Hilbert square of a K3 surface of genus eight in terms of secant lines to the surface.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical structure of graded Betti numbers in the quadratic strand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical results, initiated by Castelnuovo and Fano and later refined by Eisenbud and Harris, provide several upper bounds on the number of quadrics defining a nondegenerate projective variety. Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.
  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be an irreducible smooth projective curve of genus $g\geq 2$ over an algebraically closed field. We prove that the moduli stack of semi-stable vector bundles on $C$ of fixed rank and determinant is $\mathbb{A}^1$--connected. We also show that the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic vector bundles with a fixed determinant and a given quasi-parabolic data along a set of points in $C$, as well as its open substacks consisting of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-semistable vector bundles for any system of weights $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, are also $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected.</description>

      <title>Extremal descendant integrals on moduli spaces of curves: An inequality discovered and proved in collaboration with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the pure $\psi$-class intersection numbers $D(\textbf{e})=\langle \tau_{e_1} \cdots \tau_{e_n} \rangle_g$ on the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of stable curves, we determine for which choices of $\textbf{e}=(e_1, \ldots, e_n)$ the value of $D(\textbf{e})$ becomes extremal. The intersection number is minimal for powers of a single $\psi$-class (i.e. all $e_i$ but one vanish), whereas maximal values are obtained for balanced vectors ($|e_i - e_j| \leq 1$ for all $i,j$). The proof uses the nefness of the $\psi$-classes combined with Khovanskii--Teissier log-concavity.
  Apart from the mathematical content, this paper is also meant as an experiment in collaborations between human mathematicians and AI models: the proof of the above result was found and formulated by the AI models GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro. Large parts of the paper were drafted by Claude Opus 4.5, and a part of the argument was formalized in Lean with the help of Claude Code and GPT-5.2. The paper aims for maximal transparency on the authorship of different sections and the employed AI tools (including prompts and conversation logs).</description>

Abstract: An abelian fibration is a proper projective surjective map of complex varieties with general fiber an abelian variety. Consider a multiple fiber of an abelian fibration, and let $m_1, ..., m_k$ be the multiplicities of its irreducible components.

      <title>Characterizing Cohen-Macaulay One-Loop Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized hypergeometric systems, in the sense of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky, associated with one-loop Feynman integrals, and determine when their rank is independent of space-time dimension and propagator powers. This is equivalent to classifying when the associated affine semigroup ring is Cohen-Macaulay. For massive one-loop integrals, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness, generalizing previous results on normality for these rings. We show that for Feynman integrals, the Cohen-Macaulay property is fully determined by an integer linear program built from the Newton polytope of the integrand and find a graphical description of its solutions. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition for Cohen-Macaulayness of general one-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Braids for Knots in $S_{g} \times S^{1}$ and the affine Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Kim} it is shown that for an oriented surface $S_{g}$ of genus $g$ links in $S_{g} \times S^{1}$ can be presented by virtual diagrams with a decoration, called {\em double lines}. In this paper, first we define braids with double lines for links in $S_{g}\times S^{1}$. We denote the group of braids with double lines by $VB_{n}^{dl}$. The Alexander and Markov theorems for links in $S_{g}\times S^{1}$ can be proved analogously to the work in \cite{NegiPrabhakarKamada}. We show that if we restrict our interest to the group $B_{n}^{dl}$ generated by braids with double lines, but without virtual crossings, then the Hecke algebra of $B_{n}^{dl}$ is isomorphic to the affine Hecke algebra. Moreover, we define a Markov trace from the affine Hecke algebra to the Kauffman bracket skein module of $S^{2}\times S^{1}$.</description>

      <title>Surface counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Eisenbud-Goto regularity conjecture is true for arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay varieties, projective curves, smooth surfaces, smooth threefolds in $\mathbb{P}^5$, and toric varieties of codimension two. After J. McCullough and I. Peeva constructed counterexamples in 2018, it has been an interesting question to find the categories such that the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture holds. So far, surface counterexamples have not been found while counterexamples of any dimension greater or equal to 3 are known.
  In this paper, we construct counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture for projective surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and investigate projective invariants, cohomological properties, and geometric properties. The counterexamples are constructed via binomial rational maps between projective spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is to detect when an irreducible projective variety V is not toric. We do this by analyzing a Lie group and a Lie algebra associated to V. If the dimension of V is strictly less than the dimension of the above mentioned objects, then V is not a toric variety. We provide an algorithm to compute the Lie algebra of an irreducible variety and use it to provide examples of non-toric statistical models in algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Groups with Torsors That Are Versal for All Affine Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and let $G$ be an affine algebraic group over $k$. Call a $G$-torsor weakly versal for a class of $k$-schemes $\cal C$ if it specializes to every $G$-torsor over a scheme in $\cal C$. A recent result of the first author, Reichstein and Williams says that for any $d\geq 0$, there exists a $G$-torsor over a finite type $k$-scheme that is weakly versal for finite type affine $k$-schemes of dimension at most $d$. The first author also observed that if $G$ is unipotent, then $G$ admits a torsor over a finite type $k$-scheme that is weakly versal for all affine $k$-schemes, and that the converse holds if $\operatorname{char} k=0$. In this work, we extend this to all fields, showing that $G$ is unipotent if and only if it admits a $G$-torsor over a quasi-compact base that is weakly versal for all finite type regular affine $k$-schemes. Our proof is characteristic-free and it also gives rise to a quantitative statement: If $G$ is a non-unipotent subgroup of $\mathbf{GL}_n$, then a $G$-torsor over a quasi-projective $k$-scheme of dimension $d$ is not weakly versal for finite type regular affine $k$-schemes of dimension $n(d+1)+2$. This means in particular that every such $G$ admits a nontrivial torsor over a regular affine $(n+2)$-dimensional variety. When $G$ contains a nontrivial torus, we show that nontrivial torsors already exist over $3$-dimensional smooth affine varieties (even when $G$ is special), and this is optimal in general.
  In the course of the proof, we show that for every $m,\ell\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ with $\ell\neq 1$, there exists a smooth affine $k$-scheme $X$ carrying an $\ell$-torsion line bundle that cannot be generated by $m$ global sections. We moreover study the minimal possible dimension of such an $X$ and show that it is $m$, $m+1$ or $m+2$.</description>

      <title>Line bundles on Contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ via Coinvariant Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using representations of vertex operator algebras, we describe the line bundles on a wide range of contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$, the moduli space of stable $n$-pointed rational curves, by proving a stronger version of the contraction theorem for these morphisms. These include the celebrated constructions of Kapranov, Keel, and Knudsen. Our main result suggests that while many so-called F-curves are not $K_X$-negative, they exhibit behavior similar to $K_X$-negative curves. This reveals for instance, a distinguished property of Knudsen's construction $f_{\text{Knu}}:\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}\to \overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}\times_{\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-2}}\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}$, allowing for the classification of all possible factorizations of $f_{\text{Knu}}$, as well as further applications, and generalizations.</description>

      <title>Toric Multivariate Gaussian Models from Symmetries in a Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a rooted tree $T$ on $n$ non-root leaves with colored and zeroed nodes, we construct a linear space $L_T$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices with constraints determined by the combinatorics of the tree. When $L_T$ represents the covariance matrices of a Gaussian model, it provides natural generalizations of Brownian motion tree (BMT) models in phylogenetics. When $L_T$ represents a space of concentration matrices of a Gaussian model, it gives certain colored Gaussian graphical models, which we refer to as BMT derived models. We investigate conditions under which the reciprocal variety $L_T^{-1}$ is toric. Relying on the birational isomorphism of the inverse matrix map, we show that if the BMT derived graph of $T$ is vertex-regular and a block graph, under the derived Laplacian transformation, $L_T^{-1}$ is the vanishing locus of a toric ideal. This ideal is given by the sum of the toric ideal of the Gaussian graphical model on the block graph, the toric ideal of the original BMT model, and binomial linear conditions coming from vertex-regularity. To this end, we provide monomial parametrizations for these toric models realized through paths among leaves in $T$.</description>

      <title>A derived category analogue of the Nakai--Moishezon criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of the line bundles on a proper variety whose tensor powers generate the derived category, answering a 2010 question of Chris Brav. The condition is analogous to the Nakai--Moishezon criterion and can be stated purely in terms of classical notions of positivity of line bundles. There is also a generalization which works for all Noetherian schemes. We use our criterion to prove basic properties of such line bundles and provide non-trivial examples of them. As an application, we give new examples of varieties which can be reconstructed from their derived categories in the sense of the Bondal--Orlov Reconstruction Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Krah's method, we construct new examples of phantom categories as semiorthogonal components of the derived categories of two types of rational surfaces: the blowup of the plane at 11 points in general position, and the blowup of the second Hirzebruch surface at 9 points in general position. We also pose conjectures about the existence of phantom subcategories in the derived categories of other rational surfaces, obtained as the blowups of the other Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Real isotropic motivic spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the category of real isotropic motivic spectra, and show that the real realization functor from motivic spectra over $\mathbb{R}$ to classical spectra factors through it. We then describe its cellular subcategory as a one-parameter deformation of the category of spectra, with parameter $\rho$ corresponding to $-1 \in \mathbb{R}^{\times}$, whose special fiber is the derived category of comodules over the dual Steenrod algebra. This leads to an identification of real isotropic cellular spectra with $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic spectra, and sheds light on the relation between motivic homotopy theory over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic homotopy theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove the finiteness of leaps of modules of $m$-integrable derivations for algebras essentially of finite type and, more generally, for schemes essentially of finite type over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This provides an affirmative answer to a question posed by L. N. Macarro. As an application, we establish the coherence of the module of $\infty$-integrable derivations.</description>

Abstract: We show that the double dual EPW sextic and double EPW sextic associated with a strongly smooth Gushel--Mukai surface can be realized as moduli spaces of semistable objects with respect to a stability condition on the bounded derived category of it. Also, we observe that double dual EPW surface and double EPW surface associated with a special Gushel--Mukai threefold can be realized as moduli spaces of semistable objects on its Kuznetsov component. As an application, we refine a statement of Bayer and Perry about Gushel--Mukai threefolds with equivalent Kuznetsov components for the special ones.</description>

      <title>Height arguments toward the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem.
  (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov multiplier of any iteration is not an integer.
  (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism, where $f$ and $g$ are surjective endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a projective curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$.
  Using the second result, we deal with the case of split self-maps of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct.
  In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagined -- even for endomorphisms of tori with zero entropy. One may compare them with the conjectures and results stated in [CGSZ21] and [XY25].</description>

      <title>The Smith form of Sylvester and B\'ezout matrices for zero-dimensional ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and let $f,g \in \mathbb{K}[x,y]$ be such that the ideal $\langle f,g \rangle$ is zero-dimensional. We study the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant polynomial matrices, built by interpreting $f$ and $g$ as univariate polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{K}[y]$. We characterize their Smith forms over $\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the dual spaces of differential operators, that were defined and studied by H. M. M\"{o}ller et al. In particular, if $\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed we show that, if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are coprime over $\mathbb{K}[y]$, then the partial multiplicities of the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices coincide with certain integers, that we call M\"{o}ller indices. These indices are uniquely determined by $\langle f,g \rangle$, and can be easily computed from a Gauss basis, as defined in [M. G. Marinari, H. M. M\"{o}ller, T. Mora, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 348(8):3283--3321, 1996], of the dual spaces. We then generalize this result to the case of common factors in the leading coefficients, which correspond to intersections at $x=\infty$, again describing all the invariant factors of Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices. As a corollary, this fully characterizes the algebraic multiplicity of all the roots of the resultant $\mathrm{Res}_x(f,g) \in \mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the intersection multiplicities for $f$ and $g$, including those arising from infinite intersections. We discuss both algebraic and computational implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Genus-One Fibrations and the Jacobian of Linear Slices in the Quintic Equal-Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Diophantine equation $a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5$ under the linear slicing constraint $(c+d)-(a+b)=h$. We first establish the necessary modular constraint $30 \mid h$. For any nonzero slice $h$, the problem reduces to finding rational points on a genus-one fibration over $\mathbb{Q}(S)$. Passing to the Jacobian fibration $E_h/\mathbb{Q}(S)$, we identify a global rational $2$-torsion section and prove that $E_h$ never admits full rational $2$-torsion. This is achieved by reducing the splitting condition of the $2$-division field to finding rational points on a universal genus-two hyperelliptic curve, for which we rigorously verify the set of rational points using the method of Chabauty and Coleman. We further show that the Jacobian fibrations for all $h \neq 0$ are isomorphic over a rational function field. Focusing on the representative slice $h=30$, we compute the explicit invariants of the elliptic surface and apply the Gusi\'c--Tadi\'c injectivity criterion for the specialization homomorphism. Based on verified computations of specialized ranks, we establish the uniform upper bound $\mathrm{rank}\,E_h(\mathbb{Q}(S)) \le 1$ for all $h \neq 0$. Finally, we discuss the additional inequality and parity constraints required to recover integer solutions from the fibration.</description>
