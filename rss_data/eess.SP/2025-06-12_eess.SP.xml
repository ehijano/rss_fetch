      <title>Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</description>

      <title>Energy efficiency of DMAs vs. conventional MIMO: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the stringent and challenging need for `greener communications' in increasingly power-hungry 5G networks, this paper presents a detailed energy efficiency analysis for three different multi-antenna architectures, namely fully-digital arrays, hybrid arrays, and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). By leveraging a circuital model, which captures mutual coupling, insertion losses, propagation through the waveguides in DMAs and other electromagnetic phenomena, we design a transmit Wiener filter solution for the three systems. We then use these results to analyze the energy efficiency, considering different consumption models and supplied power, and with particular focus on the impact of the physical phenomena. DMAs emerge as an efficient alternative to classical arrays across diverse tested scenarios, most notably under low transmission power, strong coupling, and scalability requirements.</description>

      <title>Not all those who drift are lost: Drift correction and calibration scheduling for the IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors provide a vital source of data that link digital systems with the physical world. However, as sensors age, the relationship between what they measure and what they output changes. This is known as sensor drift and poses a significant challenge that, combined with limited opportunity for re-calibration, can severely limit data quality over time. Previous approaches to drift correction typically require large volumes of ground truth data and do not consider measurement or prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic sensor drift correction method that takes a fundamental approach to modelling the sensor response using Gaussian Process Regression. Tested using dissolved oxygen sensors, our method delivers mean squared error (MSE) reductions of up to 90% and more than 20% on average. We also propose a novel uncertainty-driven calibration schedule optimisation approach that builds on top of drift correction and further reduces MSE by up to 15.7%.</description>

      <title>Integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding and Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN, showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an encoding mechanism.

      <title>Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic for Dual-Objective Control of Multi-UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives: maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently, an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment demonstrates GADC's superior performance.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Sensing Enabled Predictive Beamforming: Fundamentals, Framework, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article proposes a novel near-field predictive beamforming framework for high-mobility wireless networks. Specifically, due to the spherical waves and non-uniform Doppler frequencies brought by the near-field region, the new ability of full-dimensional location and velocity sensing is characterized. Building on this foundation, the near-field predictive beamforming framework is proposed to proactively design beamformers for mobility users following arbitrary trajectories. Compared to the conventional far-field counterpart, the near-field predictive beamforming stands out due to: i) Prior-Knowledge-Free Prediction, and ii) Low-Complexity and Generalizable System Design. To realize these advantages, the implementation methods are discussed, followed by a case study confirming the benefits of the proposed framework. Finally, the article highlights promising research opportunities inspired by the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Development of a Photon-Counting Deadtime Noise Model that Extends Dynamic Range and Resolution in Atmospheric Lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives and validates a noise model that encapsulates deadtime of non-paralyzable detectors with random photon arrivals to enable advanced processing, like maximum-likelihood estimation, of high resolution atmospheric lidar profiles while accounting for deadtime bias. This estimator was validated across a wide dynamic range at high resolution (4 millimeters in range, 17 milliseconds in time). Experiments demonstrate that the noise model outperforms the current state-of-the-art for very short time-of-flight (2 nanoseconds) and extended targets (1 microsecond). The proposed noise model also produces accurate deadtime correction for very short integration times. This work sets the foundation for further study into accurate retrievals of high flux and dynamic atmospheric features, e.g., clouds and aerosol layers.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven SEEG Channel Ranking for Epileptogenic Zone Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and explainability.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue-Based Detection in MIMO Systems for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system, where a base station simultaneously serves a MIMO communication user and a remote MIMO sensing receiver, without channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Existing MIMO ISAC literature often prioritizes communication rate or detection probability, typically under constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) assumptions, without jointly analyzing detection reliability and communication constraints. To address this gap, we adopt an eigenvalue-based detector for robust sensing and use a performance metric, the total detection error, that jointly captures false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities. We derive novel closed-form expressions for both probabilities under the eigenvalue detector, enabling rigorous sensing analysis. Using these expressions, we formulate and solve a joint power allocation and threshold optimization problem that minimizes total detection error while meeting a minimum communication rate requirement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design substantially outperforms conventional CFAR-based schemes, highlighting the benefits of power- and threshold-aware optimization in MIMO ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise factor formula as the gains.</description>

      <title>Don't be Afraid of Cell Complexes! An Introduction from an Applied Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell complexes (CCs) are a higher-order network model deeply rooted in algebraic topology that has gained interest in signal processing and network science recently. However, while the processing of signals supported on CCs can be described in terms of easily-accessible algebraic or combinatorial notions, the commonly presented definition of CCs is grounded in abstract concepts from topology and remains disconnected from the signal processing methods developed for CCs. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a simplified definition of CCs that is accessible to a wider audience and can be used in practical applications. Specifically, we first introduce a simplified notion of abstract regular cell complexes (ARCCs). These ARCCs only rely on notions from algebra and can be shown to be equivalent to regular cell complexes for most practical applications. Second, using this new definition we provide an accessible introduction to (abstract) cell complexes from a perspective of network science and signal processing. Furthermore, as many practical applications work with CCs of dimension 2 and below, we provide an even simpler definition for this case that significantly simplifies understanding and working with CCs in practice.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Wireless System: Prototype, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising hybrid analog/digital beamforming technology to realize next-generation wireless systems with low cost, footprint, and power consumption. The research on DMA-empowered wireless systems is still at an early stage, mostly limited to theoretical studies under simplifying assumptions on the one hand and a few antenna-level experiments on the other hand. Substantial knowledge gaps arise from the lack of complete end-to-end DMA-empowered wireless system prototypes. In addition, recently unveiled benefits of strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) in DMAs remain untapped. Here, we demonstrate a K-band prototype of an end-to-end wireless system based on a DMA with strong inter-element MC. To showcase the flexible control over the DMA's radiation pattern, we present an experimental case study of simultaneously steering a beam to a desired transmitter and a null to an undesired jammer, achieving up to 43~dB discrimination. Using software-defined radios, we transmit and receive QPSK OFDM waveforms to evaluate the bit error rate. We also discuss algorithmic and technological challenges associated with envisioned future evolutions of our end-to-end testbed and real-life DMA-based wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Channel Unlabeled Sensing over a Union of Signal Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication by dynamically controlling signal propagation in the environment. However, their efficient deployment relies on accurate channel state information (CSI), which leads to high channel estimation overhead due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements. In this work, we solve this challenge by proposing a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained open-source foundation model (FM) named large wireless model (LWM) to process wireless channels and generate versatile and contextualized channel embeddings. These embeddings are then used for the joint optimization of the BS beamforming and RIS configurations. To be more specific, for joint optimization, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to automatically select the BS beamforming vector and RIS phase-shift matrix, aiming to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). This work shows that a pre-trained FM for radio signal understanding can be fine-tuned and integrated with DRL for effective decision-making in wireless networks. It highlights the potential of modality-specific FMs in real-world network optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed method outperforms the DRL-based approach and beam sweeping-based approach, achieving 9.89% and 43.66% higher SE, respectively.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Friis noise factor formulas for cascade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula, we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase avalanche photodiode.</description>

      <title>A Study on Speech Assessment with Visual Cues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive assessment of speech quality and intelligibility is essential when clean reference signals are unavailable. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates audio features and visual cues to predict PESQ and STOI scores. It employs a dual-branch architecture, where spectral features are extracted using STFT, and visual embeddings are obtained via a visual encoder. These features are then fused and processed by a CNN-BLSTM with attention, followed by multi-task learning to simultaneously predict PESQ and STOI. Evaluations on the LRS3-TED dataset, augmented with noise from the DEMAND corpus, show that our model outperforms the audio-only baseline. Under seen noise conditions, it improves LCC by 9.61% (0.8397-&gt;0.9205) for PESQ and 11.47% (0.7403-&gt;0.8253) for STOI. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating visual cues in enhancing the accuracy of non-intrusive speech assessment.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Maximization for DMA-enabled Multiuser MISO with Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offer the potential to achieve large-scale antenna arrays with low power consumption and reduced hardware costs, making them a promising technology for future communication systems. This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of DMA-enabled multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems in both uplink and downlink transmissions, using only statistical channel state information (CSI) to maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users. For the uplink system, we consider two decoding rules: minimum mean square error (MMSE) with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). For both decoders, we derive closed-form surrogates to substitute the original expressions of ergodic sum rate and formulate tractable optimization problems for designing DMA weights. Then, a weighted MMSE (WMMSE)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the ergodic sum rate. For the downlink system, we derive an approximate expression for the ergodic sum rate and formulate a hybrid analog/digital beamforming optimization problem that jointly optimizes the digital precoder and DMA weights. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed by leveraging the fractional programming framework. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived surrogates and highlight the superiority of the proposed algorithms over baseline schemes. It is shown that these algorithms are effective across various DMA settings and are particularly well-suited for system design in fast time-varying channels.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer-Based Device Fingerprinting for Wireless Security: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of the devices from which a message is received is part of security mechanisms to ensure authentication in wireless communications. Conventional authentication approaches are cryptography-based, which, however, are usually computationally expensive and not adequate in the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices tend to be low-cost and with limited resources. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of physical layer-based device fingerprinting, which is an emerging device authentication for wireless security. In particular, this article focuses on hardware impairment-based identity authentication and channel features-based authentication. They are passive techniques that are readily applicable to legacy IoT devices. Their intrinsic hardware and channel features, algorithm design methodologies, application scenarios, and key research questions are extensively reviewed here. The remaining research challenges are discussed, and future work is suggested that can further enhance the physical layer-based device fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling is Good for Single-Carrier ISAC: An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analytical study of single-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new insights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol rate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication spectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath channels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the spectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds corresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the presence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the symbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR variation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the maximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in terms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN signals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance. More importantly, we prove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the considered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the ambiguities in velocity estimation. All these conclusions are explicitly verified by numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Conventional and Tripolar EEG for High-Performance Reach-to-Grasp BCI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.</description>

      <title>Einstein from Noise: Statistical Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``Einstein from noise" (EfN) is a prominent example of the model bias phenomenon: systematic errors in the statistical model that lead to spurious but consistent estimates. In the EfN experiment, one falsely believes that a set of observations contains noisy, shifted copies of a template signal (e.g., an Einstein image), whereas in reality, it contains only pure noise observations. To estimate the signal, the observations are first aligned with the template using cross-correlation, and then averaged. Although the observations contain nothing but noise, it was recognized early on that this process produces a signal that resembles the template signal! This pitfall was at the heart of a central scientific controversy about validation techniques in structural biology.
  This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the EfN phenomenon above. We show that the Fourier phases of the EfN estimator (namely, the average of the aligned noise observations) converge to the Fourier phases of the template signal, explaining the observed structural similarity. Additionally, we prove that the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the number of noise observations and, in the high-dimensional regime, to the Fourier magnitudes of the template signal. Moreover, in the high-dimensional regime, the Fourier magnitudes converge to a scaled version of the template signal's Fourier magnitudes. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of the EfN phenomenon but also highlights potential pitfalls in template matching techniques and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of noisy observations across disciplines in engineering, statistics, physics, and biology.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume from the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the variables are highly coupled, it is hard to be solved using traditional methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called rainbow learning based algorithm (RLA), and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Specifically, the outer-loop of the RLA utilizes a fusion deep Q-network to optimize the UAV trajectory, GN scheduling, and power allocation, while the inner-loop optimizes receive beamforming by successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes, energy efficiency, and fairness.</description>

      <title>A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communications, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing an optimization framework for SIM that, unlike previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for broader applicability of the results. We first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture, offering insights into SIM optimization for various configurations and discussing the complexities associated with each case. Finally, we demonstrate that the comprehensive model considered in this work simplifies to the model traditionally used in the literature when the assumption of unilateral propagation between the levels of the SIM is made, and mutual coupling between the SIM elements is neglected. To assess the applicability of these assumptions, a case study focused on the realization of a 2D DFT was undertaken. In this context, we highlight that these assumptions introduce a significant mismatch between the SIM model and its behavior as described by the complete model, making these approximations inadequate for optimizing the SIM. Conversely, we show that employing the complete model proposed in this paper can yield excellent performance.</description>

      <title>The Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of White Gaussian Noise in Sampled I/Q Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental endeavors in radio frequency (RF) metrology is to measure the power of signals, where a common aim is to estimate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which quantifies the ratio of the maximum (peak) to the mean value. For a finite number of discrete-time samples of baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) white Gaussian noise (WGN) that are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, we derive a closed-form, exact formula for mean PAPR that is well-approximated by the natural logarithm of the number of samples plus Euler's constant. Additionally, we give related theoretical results for the mean crest factor (CF). After comparing our main result to previously published approximate formulas, we examine how violations of the WGN assumptions in sampled I/Q data result in deviations from the expected value of PAPR. Finally, utilizing a measured RF I/Q acquisition, we illustrate how our formula for mean PAPR can be applied to spectral analysis with spectrograms to verify when measured RF emissions are WGN in a given frequency band.</description>

      <title>SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analysing extracellular recordings, enabling the isolation of single-neuron activity. However, it remains a challenging problem because extracellular traces mix overlapping spikes from neighbouring cells and are marred by recording instabilities such as electrode drift. Numerous algorithms have been proposed, yet many struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their practicality for todays large-scale datasets. Approach: In response, we introduce SpikeSift, a spike-sorting algorithm expressly designed to mitigate drift while running on standard CPUs. SpikeSift (i) partitions long recordings into shorter, relatively stationary segments, (ii) carries out spike detection and clustering simultaneously through an iterative detect-and-subtract scheme within each segment, and (iii) preserves neuronal identity across segments via a fast template alignment stage that dispenses with continuous trajectory estimation. Main results: Extensive validation on paired intracellularly validated datasets and on biophysically realistic MEArec simulations covering elevated noise, diverse drift profiles, ultra short recordings and bursting activity, demonstrates that SpikeSift matches or exceeds the accuracy of state of the art methods while completing sorting an order of magnitude faster on a single desktop core. Significance: The combination of high fidelity, drift resilience, and modest computational demand renders SpikeSift broadly accessible while preserving data quality for downstream neurophysiological analysis</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a framework for the robust design of UAV-assisted wireless networks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction to address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse second-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with heuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational complexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory design, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1) near-optimal performance with $\epsilon \approx 0.67\%$ deviation from upper-bound solutions, (2) $16\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users compared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\%$ faster outage mitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed control enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy efficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior robustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for $5G/6G$ networks.</description>

      <title>A brain-inspired generative model for EEG-based cognitive state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: EEG classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets with different sampling rates demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern. Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach for RIS-aided Fair Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.</description>

Abstract: As we move towards 6G, the demand for high-precision, cost-effective positioning solutions becomes increasingly critical. Single-anchor positioning offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-anchor approaches, particularly in complex propagation environments where infrastructure costs and deployment constraints present significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of key algorithmic choices in the development of a single-anchor 5G uplink positioning testbed. Our developed testbed uses angle of arrival (AoA) estimation combined with range measurements from an ultra-wideband pair, to derive the position. The simulations conducted assess the impact of the selected algorithms on channel order and AoA estimation, while the influence of antenna calibration errors on AoA estimation is also examined. Finally, we compare simulations and results obtained from our developed platform.</description>

      <title>The envelope of a complex Gaussian random variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

      <title>Electroencephalogram Emotion Recognition via AUC Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08979</link>

Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in areas including neuroscience, cognitive science, and medical diagnostics, where accurately detecting minority classes is essential for robust model performance. This study addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the `Liking' label in the DEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior research, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence labels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To tackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at maximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of underrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier, is compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly outperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6\% to 79.7\% and improving the F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC maximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets, providing an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting minority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a precoding framework for frequency division duplex (FDD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Specifically, we aim to maximize ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) while satisfying a sensing beam pattern constraint defined by the mean squared error (MSE). Our method reconstructs downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from uplink (UL) training signals using partial reciprocity, eliminating the need for CSI feedback. To obtain the error covariance matrix of the reconstructed DL CSI, we devise an observed Fisher information-based estimation technique. Leveraging this, to mitigate interference caused by imperfect DL CSI reconstruction and sensing operations, we propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) aided precoder optimization method. This method jointly updates the precoding vector and Lagrange multipliers by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency to maximize SE. The numerical results show that the proposed design achieves precise beam pattern control, maximizes SE, and significantly improves the sensing-communication trade-off compared to the state-of-the-art methods in FDD ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</description>
