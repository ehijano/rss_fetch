      <title>Optical model potentials for deuteron scattering off $^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, $^{58}$Ni, $^{90}$Zr, $^{116}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb at $\sim$100 MeV/nucleon</title>

Abstract: Angular distributions of the elastic and inelastic deuteron-nucleus scattering off $^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, $^{58}$Ni, $^{90}$Zr, $^{116}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb have been measured at a beam energy of 98 MeV/nucleon, with the goal of constraining the deuteron optical potential in this kinematical regime, and to extract the reduced transition probabilities for the ground-state transitions to low-lying excited states of these nuclei. Two potential models were used in the analysis of the measured $(d,d)$ and $(d,d')$ data within the optical model and the distorted-wave Born approximation: the phenomenological optical model potential associated with the collective model of nuclear scattering, and the semi-microscopic double-folding model of the deuteron-nucleus potential based on a realistic density-dependent M3Y interaction. The deuteron optical potential and inelastic $(d,d')$ scattering form factors were calculated using these two potential models, allowing for a direct comparison between the potential models as well as the validation of the deduced $E\lambda$ transition rates.</description>

      <title>Resonance suppression during the hadronic stage from the FAIR to the intermediate RHIC energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy and centrality dependence of the kaon resonance ratio $(K^{*0}+\Bar{K}^{*0})/(K^+ + K^-)$ is explored in the RHIC-BES and CBM-FAIR energy regime. To this aim, the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed to simulate reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances in Au+Au and p+p collisions from $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=3-39$ GeV. We obtain a good description of the resonance yields and mean transverse momenta over the whole investigated energy range. The decrease of the $K^*/K$ ratio, with increasing centrality is in line with the available experimental data. We also observe the experimenatlly measured increase in $\langle p_{\text{T}}\rangle$ with increasing centrality which is interpreted as a lower reconstruction probability of low-$p_{\text{T}}$ $K^*$ due to the $p_{\text{T}}$ dependent absorption of the decay daughter hadrons. We conclude that the observed suppression of reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances provides a strong sign of an extended hadronic rescattering stage at all investigated energies. Its duration increases from peripheral to central reactions as expected. Following a method, suggested by the STAR experiment, the "duration" of the hadronic stage is extracted using the $K^*/K$ ratios at chemical and kinetic freeze-out. The resulting lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimental data, but much shorter than the actual lifetime of the hadronic phase in the transport simulation. This indicates that the experimental method to estimate the life time of the hadronic stage is too simplified.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall Skyrmion phase of QCD in magnetic field: Gauge field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of QCD in sufficiently strong magnetic field at finite baryon density is an inhomogeneous state consisting of an array of solitons, called the chiral soliton lattice (CSL). It is, however, replaced in a region with higher density and/or magnetic field by the so-called domain-wall Skyrmion(DWSk) phase where Skyrmions are created on top of the CSL. This was previously proposed within the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) approximation neglecting a gauge field dynamics and taking into account its effect by a flux quantization condition. In this paper, by taking into account dynamics of the gauge field, we show that the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the BPS approximation is identical to the one obtained in the BPS approximation. We also find that domain-wall Skyrmions are electrically charged with the charge one as a result of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions present an interesting case for studies of the time-evolution of entanglement between complex quantum systems. In this work, the time-dependent nuclear density functional theory is employed to explore entanglement in multinucleon transfer reactions. As an illustrative example, for the reaction $^{40}$Ca $+$ $^{208}$Pb at $E_{\rm lab} = 249$ MeV, in the interval of impact parameters $4.65-7.40$ fm, and the relativistic density functional PC-PK1, we compute the von Neumann entropies, entanglement between fragments, nucleon-number fluctuations, and Shannon entropy for the nucleon-number observable. A simple linear correlation is established between the entanglement and nucleon-number fluctuation of the final fragments. The entanglement between the fragments can be related to the corresponding excitation energies and angular momenta. The relationship between the von Neumann entropy and the Shannon entropy for the nucleon-number observable is analyzed, as well as the time-evolution of the entanglement (nucleon-number fluctuation). The entanglement is also calculated for a range of incident energies and it is shown how, depending on the impact parameter, the entanglement increases with the collision energy.</description>

      <title>Chiral dynamics in soft triaxial nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chirality in soft triaxial nuclei is investigated for the first time with the time-dependent and tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theories on a three-dimensional space lattice in a microscopic and self-consistent way. Taking the puzzling chiral nucleus $^{106}$Ag as an example, the experimental energies of the observed nearly degenerate bands are well reproduced without any free parameters beyond the well-defined density functional. A novel chiral mode in soft triaxial nuclei is newly revealed from the microscopic dynamics of the total angular momentum. This opens a new research area for the study of chirality, particularly in relation to soft nuclear shapes.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis yields the NMEs $4.34^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $^{136}$Xe and $5.51^{+0.24}_{-0.26}$ for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Beam energy dependence of net-hyperon yield and its implication on baryon transport mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the constituent quark model, each quark inside a baryon carries 1/3 unit of the baryon number. An alternative picture exists where the center of a Y-shaped topology of gluon fields, called the baryon junction, carries a unit baryon number. Studying baryon transport over a large rapidity gap ($\delta y$) in nuclear collisions provides a possible tool to distinguish these two pictures. A recent analysis of global data on net-proton yield at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions showed an exponential dependence on $\delta y$ and the exponential slope does not vary with event centrality, favoring the baryon junction picture. Since junctions are flavor blind, hyperons -- baryons containing valence strange quarks -- are expected to exhibit a similar behavior as the proton. This study aims to test this prediction by analyzing hyperon yields in Au+Au collisions at various energies. We observe that net-hyperon yields, after correcting for the strangeness production suppression, adhere to the expected exponential form. The extracted slope parameters for net-$\Lambda$, net-$\Xi$ and net-$\Omega$ are consistent with each other and with those of net-proton within uncertainties, and exhibit no centrality dependence, further substantiating the baryon junction picture. Various implementations of the \texttt{PYTHIA} event generator, primarily based on valence quarks for baryon transport, are unable to simultaneously describe the slope parameters for all baryons.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of the $X(3872)$ beyond vector meson dominance: the open-charm coupled-channel mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hidden-charm exotic hadrons will be searched for and investigated at future electron-ion colliders. For instance, the $X(3872)$ can be produced through the exclusive process $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$. The vector meson dominance model has been commonly employed in estimating the cross sections of such processes. However, the coupled-channel production mechanism through open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states may play a crucial role. To assess the significance of such contributions, we estimate the cross section of the $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$ reaction assuming the coupled-channel mechanism. For energies near the threshold, the total cross section is predicted to be of tens of nanobarns for $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$, which can be measured at future experimental facilities. Furthermore, the open-charm coupled-channel mechanism leads to a distinct line shape of the total cross section that can be utilized to reveal the production dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze data from the CsI, liquid Ar and Ge detectors of the COHERENT experiment and confirm within $1.5\sigma$ that the measured elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus, as expected for coherent scattering in the standard model. We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard neutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three datasets.</description>
