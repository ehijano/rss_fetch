      <title>ASTRODEEP-JWST: NIRCam-HST multiband photometry and redshifts for half a million sources in six extragalactic deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of $\sim$0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 $\mu$m. A grand total of $\sim$530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 $\mu$m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.</description>

      <title>The multiphase circumgalactic medium and its relation to galaxies: an observational perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a vital element in galaxies, as it mediates the baryon cycle essential for regulating galaxy activity. It is also highly complex due to the intricate distributions of temperature, density, metallicity, and ionization that make the CGM a multiphase medium. Therefore, learning about the CGM requires combining various observational techniques. This contribution starts by reviewing how absorption spectroscopy, together with modeling of the ionization conditions, yields critical insights into the underlying physical properties of the CGM. Next, the rapidly growing application of imaging and integral field spectroscopy for studying the halo gas in emission, using hydrogen and metal lines as tracers, is examined. Finally, the essential role of the CGM in galaxy evolution is highlighted by considering current studies that directly link galaxies to their halo gas. The novel dimension of how the environment affects the CGM and alters the evolution of galaxies is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. XLIX. Selecting active galactic nuclei using observed colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclid will cover over 14000 $deg^{2}$ with two optical and near-infrared spectro-photometric instruments, and is expected to detect around ten million active galactic nuclei (AGN). This unique data set will make a considerable impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution and AGN. In this work we identify the best colour selection criteria for AGN, based only on Euclid photometry or including ancillary photometric observations, such as the data that will be available with the Rubin legacy survey of space and time (LSST) and observations already available from Spitzer/IRAC. The analysis is performed for unobscured AGN, obscured AGN, and composite (AGN and star-forming) objects. We make use of the spectro-photometric realisations of infrared-selected targets at all-z (SPRITZ) to create mock catalogues mimicking both the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS). Using these catalogues we estimate the best colour selection, maximising the harmonic mean (F1) of completeness and purity. The selection of unobscured AGN in both Euclid surveys is possible with Euclid photometry alone with F1=0.22-0.23, which can increase to F1=0.43-0.38 if we limit at z&gt;0.7. Such selection is improved once the Rubin/LSST filters (a combination of the u, g, r, or z filters) are considered, reaching F1=0.84 and 0.86 for the EDS and EWS, respectively. The combination of a Euclid colour with the [3.6]-[4.5] colour, which is possible only in the EDS, results in an F1-score of 0.59, improving the results using only Euclid filters, but worse than the selection combining Euclid and LSST. The selection of composite ($f_{{\rm AGN}}$=0.05-0.65 at 8-40 $\mu m$) and obscured AGN is challenging, with F1&lt;0.3 even when including ancillary data. This is driven by the similarities between the broad-band spectral energy distribution of these AGN and star-forming galaxies in the wavelength range 0.3-5 $\mu m$.</description>

      <title>Barred AGN galaxies in paired systems: exploring the impact on nuclear activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: To unveil the influence of galaxy-galaxy interactions on material transport driven by galactic bars towards the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) galaxies and assess the efficiency of the combined mechanisms of interactions and bars in fueling massive black holes, we examine barred active galaxies in paired systems.
  Methods: Our study targets barred AGN galaxies in pairs with projected separations $r_{p}&lt; 100 \rm \,kpc \,h^{-1}$ and relative radial velocities of $\Delta V&lt; 500 \rm \,km \,s^{-1}$ within $z&lt;0.1$, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. To quantify the impact of interactions, we also created a control sample of barred active galaxies without companions, matched in redshift, absolute r-band magnitude, stellar mass, color, and stellar age. We assessed galactic bar structures through two-dimensional image modeling, considering their wide range of shapes and sizes that may affect material transport ability.
  Results: We found that nuclear activity, measured by $Lum[OIII]$, increases as projected separations between galaxy pair members decrease. Barred AGN galaxies in close pairs ($r_p&lt;$ 25 kpc $h^{-1}$) show significantly higher nuclear activity compared to the control sample. Barred galaxies with close companions exhibit enhanced nuclear activity across all luminosity, stellar mass, and color ranges. Barred AGN with longer bars show more efficient nuclear activity than those with shorter bars, with a pronounced effect in close pair systems. Nuclear activity increases as pair separations decrease. Barred AGNs in close pairs undergoing major interactions show a substantial excess of high $Lum[OIII]$ values, reflecting increased accretion onto central black holes. These findings suggest that nearby galaxy companions enhance gas flows driven by galactic bars, amplifying central nuclear activity and influencing black hole accretion.</description>

      <title>The Ones That Got Away: Chemical Tagging of Globular Cluster-Origin Stars with Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way's stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs' impact on the Galaxy's initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars--those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx99\%$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx7\%$, identifying 878 new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]$\approx-1$, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary growth of molecular clouds as traced by their infrared bright fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how stars form, evolve and impact molecular clouds is key to understanding why star formation is such an inefficient process globally. In this paper, we use the infrared bright fraction, $f_\text{IRB}$ (the fraction of a given molecular cloud that appears bright against the 8 $\mu$m Milky Way background) as a proxy for time evolution to test how cloud properties change as star formation evolves. We apply this metric to 12,000 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds we identify using the Herschel-Hi-GAL survey between $|l|&lt;70^\circ$ on the Milky Way plane. We find clouds are not static while forming stars. Instead, molecular clouds continuously gain mass while star formation progresses. By performing principal component analysis on the cloud properties, we find that they evolve down two paths distinguished by their mass gain. Most clouds (80%) gain four times more mass as a function of $f_\text{IRB}$. The remaining 20% experience an extreme period of growth, growing in mass by a factor of 150 on average and during this period, they initially gain mass fast enough to outpace their star formation. For all clouds, it is only after half their area becomes star forming that mass loss occurs. We expect stellar feedback and potentially galactic shear is responsible. By analysing cloud positions, we suggest that the rate of mass growth may be linked to the larger galactic environment. Altogether, these results have strong implications on how we assess star forming ability on cloud scales when assuming molecular cloud masses are fixed in time.</description>

      <title>Detection of gas inflow during the onset of a starburst in a low-mass galaxy at z=2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon cycle is crucial for understanding galaxy formation, as gas inflows and outflows vary throughout a galaxy's lifetime and affect its star formation rate. Despite the necessity of accretion for galaxy growth at high redshifts, direct observations of inflowing gas have proven elusive especially at $z\gtrsim2$. We present spectroscopic analysis of a galaxy at redshift $z=2.45$ which exhibits signs of inflow in several ultraviolet interstellar absorption lines, with no clear outflow signatures. The absorption lines are redshifted by $\sim$250 km sec$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic redshift, and C IV shows a prominent inverse P-Cygni profile. Simple stellar population models suggest that this galaxy has a low metallicity ($\sim$5\% solar), with a very young starburst of age $\sim$4 Myr dominating the ultraviolet luminosity. The gas inflow velocity and nebular velocity dispersion suggest an approximate halo mass of order $\sim 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a regime in which simulations predict that bursty star formation is common at this redshift. We conclude that this system is likely in the beginning of a cycle of bursty star formation, where inflow and star formation rates are high, but where supernovae and other feedback processes have not yet launched strong outflows. In this scenario, we expect the inflow-dominated phase to be observable (e.g., with net redshifted ISM absorption) for only a short timescale after a starburst onset. This result represents a promising avenue for probing the full baryon cycle, including inflows, during the formative phases of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar) III. No evidence for dissipation of turbulence down to 20 mpc (4 000 au) scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Turbulence is a key component of molecular cloud structure. It is usually described by a cascade of energy down to the dissipation scale. The power spectrum for subsonic incompressible turbulence is $k^{-5/3}$, while for supersonic turbulence it is $k^{-2}$. Aims. We aim to determine the power spectrum in an actively star-forming molecular cloud, from parsec scales down to the expected magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave cutoff (dissipation scale). Methods. We analyze observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region in three different tracers to cover the different scales from $\sim$10 pc down to 20 mpc. The largest scales are covered with the low density gas tracer $^{13}$CO (1-0) obtained with single dish, the intermediate scales are covered with single-dish observations of the C$^{18}$O (3-2) line, while the smallest scales are covered in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) and HNC (1-0) with a combination of NOEMA interferometer and IRAM 30m single dish observations. The complementarity of these observations enables us to generate a combined power spectrum covering more than two orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Results. We derive the power spectrum in an active star-forming region spanning more than 2 decades of spatial scales. The power spectrum of the intensity maps shows a single power-law behavior, with an exponent of 2.9$\pm$0.1 and no evidence of dissipation. Moreover, there is evidence for the power-spectrum of the ions to have more power at smaller scales than the neutrals, which is opposite from theoretical expectations. Conclusions. We show new possibilities of studying the dissipation of energy at small scales in star-forming regions provided by interferometric observations.</description>

      <title>Extended correlations between diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic analysis of the correlations between diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) is extended to weak DIBs through the comprehensive catalogue of the Apache Peak Observatory (APO) of 559 DIBs in 25 lines of sight with diverse interstellar properties. The main results are the following: 1) An extension of the number of DIBs identified to be related to C2, that is, those that need very shielded interstellar regions for their carriers to survive UV photo-dissociation. Based on the correlations with the reference C2 and zeta DIBs, anticorrelations with UV-favoured (sigma) DIBs, and the strength ratios in shielded and unshielded sight lines, we propose 12 new C2 candidates and 34 possible "C2-related" DIBs (mostly at lambda &lt; 5950 A ) in addition to the ~20 known confirmed C2 DIBs. With these additions, the census of C2 DIBs might approach completion. 2) We discovered that the intensities of a large set of poorly studied DIBs are strongly enhanced in one or two of the sight lines of HD 175156 and HD 148579. This tentative class, denoted "chi" for the time being, might include up to 50-100 members, half at lambda &gt; 6000 A , and a number of C2 DIBs. These possible enhancements might reflect specific formation processes of their carriers that are yet to be identified in the interstellar medium of these two sight lines. The possible matches of the wavelength of five very broad DIBs, including three "chi" DIBs, with the strong bands that were recently measured by action spectroscopy might favour some long carbon chains and rings as carriers of some DIBs. These correlations and findings justify further theoretical and laboratory efforts for improving our understanding of the complex physics, spectroscopy, and chemistry of the various carbon chains and rings, and their possible formation and destruction in the diffuse interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient process at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive ($M_\ast = 1.2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$) recently quenched AGN-host galaxy at $z=4$ as a evidence that AGN-driven outflows could be one such mechanism. Based on JWST spectrum, the star formation rate of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of $\sim50$~Myrs. The current specific star formation rate is $5\times10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission line ratios of [NeIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/H$\beta$ emission indicate the presence of an AGN. A series of FeII and MgII absorption lines appear blueshifted by $\sim250$ km~s$^{-1}$ relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimate mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than star formation rate derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the AGN-driven outflow. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the universe.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations in the Phase-Space Structure of Dark Matter Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new scaling relations for the isotropic phase-space distribution functions (DFs) and energy distributions of simulated dark matter haloes. These relations are inspired by those for the singular isothermal sphere with density profile $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$, for which the DF satisfies $f(E) \propto r_{\max}^{-2}(E)$ and the energy distribution satisfies $dM/dE \propto r_{\max}(E)$, with $r_{\max}(E)$ being the radius where the gravitational potential equals energy $E$. For the simulated haloes, we find $f(E)\propto r_{\max}^{-2.08}(E)$ and $dM/dE \propto r_{\max}(E)$ across broad energy ranges. In addition, the proportionality coefficients depend on the gravitational constant and the parameters of the best-fit Navarro-Frenk-White density profile. These scaling relations are satisfied by haloes over a wide mass range and provide an efficient method to approximate their DFs and energy distributions. Understanding the origin of these relations may shed more light on halo formation.</description>

      <title>IC 2560 and UGC 3193 megamaser AGN black hole mass estimations using general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important current problem regarding the characterization of the central engine of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consists in determining the parameters of the black holes (BHs) hosted at their cores, especially their mass. Therefore, we aim to apply a full general relativistic method to estimate the parameters of the central supermassive BHs hosted at the center of the IC 2560 and UGC 3193 galaxies. In order to achieve this aim we implement a general relativistic BH rotation curves' method and estimate the BH parameters by fitting megamaser astrophysical data available in the literature with the help of a Bayesian statistical method. We calculate the mass of the aforementioned BHs, their positions on the sky as well as the recession velocities of the host galaxies. On the basis of our estimations, we compute for the first time the BH mass of the UGC 3193 AGN. We also calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to these BHs, a general relativistic effect produced by the curvature of spacetime that has no Newtonian analogue.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Morphology of The Stellar Components in HI-bearing Dwarf Galaxies and The Dependence on Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic morphology of stellar components within HI-bearing dwarf galaxies remains a topic of uncertainty. Leveraging the galaxy dataset derived from the cross-matched catalog of the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI 21cm line survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology and assume a triaxial model to scrutinize the inherent stellar distributions of these HI-bearing dwarf galaxies. Our analysis indicates a preference for oblate-triaxial models with $C&lt;B\lesssim A$, indicative of thick stellar disks, characterizing the stellar components in these HI-bearing dwarfs with stellar masses ranging between $10^7\--10^{9.5}\ M_{\odot}$. The average thickness of the stellar components in HI-bearing dwarf galaxies approximates $C/A\sim 0.4$. Furthermore, we observe that the thickness of the stellar disks exhibits weak or negligible dependence on the stellar masses of HI-bearing galaxies.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Interstellar Ice Morphology: Atomistic Simulations Reveal the Complex Behavior of Ethanethiol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethanethiol (C$_2$H$_5$SH), a molecule detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), indicates the rich chemistry involving sulfur atoms. However, its behavior at low temperatures remains elusive, particularly the reported transition from an amorphous phase to a crystal. This study employs classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce the liquid-state properties of ethanethiol and to simulate the initial amorphous state of ethanethiol films deposited on a KBr substrate. The amorphous ethanethiol did not show spontaneous crystallization upon increasing temperature. Also, ethanethiol ice crystals exhibit melting behavior on KBr substrate at elevated temperatures. Our MD simulations of thin ice samples do not show any signature reversible phase change. It will be interesting to continue this study with a thicker sample, which is beyond our current computational means. These findings underscore the complexity of icy mantle morphology on cold ISM dust grains.</description>

      <title>ISMGCC: Finding Gas Structures in Molecular Interstellar Medium Using Gaussian Decomposition and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular line emissions are commonly used to trace the distribution and properties of molecular Interstellar Medium (ISM). However, the emissions are heavily blended on the Galactic disk toward the inner Galaxy because of the relatively large line widths and the velocity overlaps of spiral arms. Structure identification methods based on voxel connectivity in PPV data cubes often produce unrealistically large structures, which is the ``over-linking'' problem. Therefore, identifying molecular cloud structures in these directions is not trivial. We propose a new method based on Gaussian decomposition and graph theory to solve the over-linking problem, named ISMGCC (InterStellar Medium Gaussian Component Clustering). Using the MWISP ${}^{13}\mathrm{CO}~(1-0)$ data in the range of $13.5^{\circ} \leq l \leq 14.5^{\circ}, |b| \leq 0.5^{\circ}$, and $-100\leq V_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq +200~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, our method identified three hundred molecular gas structures with at least 16 pixels. These structures contain $92\%$ of the total flux in the raw data cube. Meanwhile, these structures show single-peaked line profiles on more than $93\%$ of their pixels. This indicates that the ISMGCC method could distinguish gas structures in crowded regions with minimal flux loss.</description>

      <title>PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey -- I. Survey description and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds from surveys are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O ($J$=3$-$2) of several molecular cloud complexes including W5 and NGC 7538 in the outer Perseus spiral arm situated at $\ell \approx 110^{\circ}$ and $\ell \approx 135^{\circ}$, with a total survey area of $\sim$6 deg$^2$. The PAMS data have an effective resolution of 17.2 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of $T_\rm{mb} = 0.7$ K in 0.3 km/s channels. We present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS), incorporating archival $^{12}$CO (3$-$2) data. By comparing the various CO data with maps of H$_2$ column density from $\textit{Herschel}$, we find that the CO-to-H$_2$ column density $X$-factors do not vary significantly between Galactocentric radii of 4 and 10 kpc, and present representative values of $X_{^{12}\rm{CO} 3-2}$ and $X_{^{13}\rm{CO} 3-2}$. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of $^{13}$CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the $X$-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of Radio AGN: New Views from Combining LoTSS and MaNGA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of radio mode AGN feedback on galaxy evolution is still under debate. In this study, we utilize a combination of radio continuum observations and optical integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data to explore the impact of radio AGN on the evolution of their host galaxies at both global and sub-galactic scales. We construct a comprehensive radio-IFS sample comprising 5578 galaxies with redshift z &lt; 0.15 by cross-matching the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the MaNGA survey. We revisit the tight linear radio continuum - star formation relation and quantify its intrinsic scatter, then use the relation to classify 616 radio-excess AGN with excessive radio luminosities over that expected from their star formation rate. Massive radio AGN host galaxies are predominantly quiescent systems, but the quenching level shows no correlation with the jet luminosity. The mass assembly histories derived from the stellar population synthesis model fitting agree with the cosmological simulations incorporating radio-mode AGN feedback models. We observe that radio AGN hosts grow faster than a control sample of galaxies matched in stellar mass, and the quenching age (~ 5 Gyr) is at larger lookback times than the typical radio jet age (&lt; 1 Gyr). By stacking the spectra in different radial bins and comparing results for radio AGN hosts and their controls, we find emission line excess features in the nuclear region of radio AGN hosts. This indicates that radio AGN are ionizing the surrounding interstellar medium in the vicinity of the nucleus. We also find that ongoing star formation in the outer regions of the galaxy is weaker if a radio jet is detected. Our findings support the scenario that the observed present-day radio AGN activity is not responsible for the past quenching of their hosts, but may help the host galaxies maintain quiescence through ionizing and heating the surrounding gas.</description>

      <title>Ionising properties of galaxies in JADES for a stellar mass complete sample: resolving the cosmic ionising photon budget crisis at the Epoch of Reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to study the ionising properties of a sample of 15721 galaxies at $3 \leq z_{\rm{phot}} \leq 9$, 90\% complete in stellar mass down to log(M$_{\star}$/[M$_{\odot}$])$\approx 7.5$. Out of the full sample, 1620 of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature. We use the spectral energy distribution fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to fit all available photometry and infer galaxy properties. We find a significantly milder evolution of the ionising photon production efficiency (\xion\/) with redshift and UV magnitude than previously reported. Interestingly, we observe two distinct populations in \xion\/, distinguished by their burstiness (given by SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{100}$). Both populations show the same evolution with $z$ and M$_{\rm{UV}}$, but have a different \xion\/ normalisation. We convolve the more representative $\log(\xi_{\rm{ion}} (z,\text{M}_{\rm{UV}}))$ relations (accounting for $\sim96$\% of the sample), with luminosity functions from literature, to place constraints on the cosmic ionising photon budget. By combining our results, we find that one of our models can match the observational constraints from the \lya\/ forest at $z\lesssim6$. We conclude that galaxies with M$_{\rm{UV}}$ between $-16$ and $-20$, adopting a reasonable escape fraction, can produce enough ionising photons to ionise the Universe, without exceeding the required ionising photon budget.</description>

      <title>Experimental and computational study of ethanolamine ices at astrochemical conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) has recently been identified in the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, situated in the SgrB2 complex in the Galactic center. However, its presence in other regions, and in particular in star-forming sites, is still elusive. Given its likely role as a precursor to simple amino acids, understanding its presence in the star-forming region is required. Here, we present the experimentally obtained temperature-dependent spectral features and morphological behavior of pure ethanolamine ices under astrochemical conditions in the 2 - 12 micro meter (MIR) and 120 - 230 nm (VUV) regions for the first time. These features would help in understanding its photochemical behavior. In addition, we present the first chemical models specifically dedicated to ethanolamine. These models include all the discussed chemical routes from the literature, along with the estimated binding energies and activation energies from quantum chemical calculations reported in this work. We have found that surface reactions: CH2OH + NH2CH2 --&gt; NH2CH2CH2OH and NH2 + C2H4OH --&gt; NH2CH2CH2OH in warmer regions (60-90 K) could play a significant role in the formation of ethanolamine. Our modeled abundance of ethanolamine complements the upper limit of ethanolamine column density estimated in earlier observations in hot core/corino regions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimation of the rotational and distortional constants for various species (such as HNCCO, NH2CHCO, and NH2CH2CO) related to ethanolamine that have not been studied in existing literature. This study could be valuable for identifying these species in the future.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) III. Fiber networks in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Herschel observations unveiled the complex organisation of the interstellar medium in networks of parsec-scale filaments over the past decade. At the same time, networks of fibers have been recognised describing the gas structures in star-forming regions at sub-parsec scales. We aim to investigate the dense gas organisation prior to the formation of stars in sample of 7 star-forming regions within Orion. This EMERGE Early ALMA Survey includes OMC-1/-2/-3/-4 South, LDN 1641N, NGC 2023, and the Flame Nebula, all surveyed at high spatial resolution (4.5'' or $\sim2000$ au) in N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0) using ALMA+IRAM-30m observations. We systematically investigated the star-forming gas spatial distribution, its column density variations, its thermal structure, and its internal motions in a wide range of environments. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identified and characterised a total of 152 velocity-coherent fibers in our survey, which appear to be the preferred organisational unit for the dense gas in low-, intermediate- and high-mass star-forming regions alike. Despite the uneven density of fibers within these sub-parsec networks, the masses and lengths of these objects show similar distributions and consistent median values, as well as (trans-)sonic motions, in all of our targets. The comparison between the fiber line masses and virial line masses suggests the majority of these objects to be sub-virial. Those fibers closer to the virial condition, however, also have the most protostars associated to them, proving to be intimately connected to star formation. Finally, the surface density of fibers is linearly correlated with the total dense gas mass throughout roughly one order of magnitude in both parameters. These findings demonstrate how the formation and evolution of fibers networks can explain the current star formation properties of their host region.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved comparison of SFRs from UV and H$\alpha$ in GASP gas-stripped galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-formation rates (SFR) in galaxies offer a view of various physical processes across them and are measured using various tracers, such as H$\alpha$ and UV. Different physical mechanisms can affect H$\alpha$ and UV emission, resulting in a discrepancy in the corresponding SFR estimates ($\Delta SFR$). We investigate the effects of ram pressure on the SFR measurements and $\Delta SFR$ across 5 galaxies from the GASP survey caught in the late stages of gas stripping due to ram pressure. We probe spatially resolved $\Delta SFR$ at pixel scales of 0.5 kpc, and compare disks to tails, and regions dominated by the dense gas to diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions. The regions dominated by dense gas show similar SFR values for UV and H$\alpha$ tracers, while the regions dominated by the DIG show up to 0.5 dex higher SFR(UV). There is a large galaxy-by-galaxy variation in $\Delta SFR$, with no difference between the disks and the tails. We discuss the potential causes of variations in $\Delta SFR$ between the dense gas and DIG areas. We conclude that the dominant cause of discrepancy is recent variations in star formation histories, where star formation recently dropped in the DIG-dominated regions leading to changes in $\Delta SFR$. The areal coverage of the tracers shows areas with H$\alpha$ and no UV emission; these areas have LINER-like emission (excess in $[OI\lambda\,6300]/H\alpha$ line ratio), indicating that they are ionized by processes other than star-formation.</description>

      <title>Inference of black-hole mass fraction in Galactic globular clusters. A multi-dimensional approach to break the initial-condition degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Globular clusters (GCs) are suggested to host many stellar-mass black holes (BHs) at their centers, thus resulting in ideal testbeds for BH formation and retention theories. BHs are expected to play a major role in GC structural and dynamical evolution and their study has attracted a lot of attention. In recent years, several works attempted to constrain the BH mass fraction in GCs typically by comparing a single observable (for example mass segregation proxies) with scaling relations obtained from numerical simulations. Aims. We aim to uncover the possible intrinsic degeneracies in determining the BH mass fraction from single dynamical parameters and identify the possible parameter combinations that are able to break these degeneracies. Methods. We used a set of 101 Monte Carlo simulations sampling a large grid of initial conditions. In particular, we explored the impact of different BH natal kick prescriptions on widely adopted scaling relations. We then compared the results of our simulations with observations obtained using state-of-the-art HST photometric and astrometric catalogs for a sample of 30 Galactic GCs. Results. We find that using a single observable to infer the present-day BH mass fraction in GCs is degenerate, as similar values could be attained by simulations including different BH mass fractions. We argue that the combination of mass-segregation indicators with GC velocity dispersion ratios could help us to break this degeneracy efficiently. We show that such a combination of parameters can be derived with currently available data. However, the limited sample of stars with accurate kinematic measures and its impact on the overall errors do not allow us to discern fully different scenarios yet.</description>

      <title>Energy evolution in the progenitor of galaxy shells: a semi-analytical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar shells surrounding an elliptical galaxy, as remnants of a dwarf galaxy disrupted during merging, reveal the distribution of energy and angular momentum of the progenitor dwarf galaxy. We develop a semi-analytical model to describe the changes of energy $\Delta E_i$ and angular momentum $\Delta Lz_i$ for particles during the first infall. We show that these changes, induced by the self-gravity of the progenitor, are important in broadening the initial energy distribution of the Plummer or Hernquist progenitor model. Consequently, these changes are crucial in shaping the shells. In the free fall stage following the disintegration of the progenitor potential, particles are no longer bound by self-gravity but move within the gravitational potential of the target galaxy. We investigate the relationship between the radial period and the energy of particles undergoing radial motion. We show that an accurate model of the energy range of the dwarf galaxy at disruption is essential to predict the number of observable shells.</description>

      <title>Radial Transport in High-Redshift Disk Galaxies Dominated by Inflowing Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radial transport of cold gas within simulated disk galaxies at cosmic noon, aiming at distinguishing between disk instability and accretion along cold streams from the cosmic web as its driving mechanism. Disks are selected based on kinematics and flattening from the VELA zoom-in hydro-cosmological simulations. The radial velocity fields in the disks are mapped, their averages are computed as a function of radius and over the whole disk, and the radial mass flux in each disk as a function of radius is obtained. The transport directly associated with fresh incoming streams is identified by selecting cold gas cells that are either on incoming streamlines or have low metallicity. The radial velocity fields in VELA disks are found to be highly non-axisymmetric, showing both inflows and outflows. However, in most cases, the average radial velocities, both as a function of radius and over the whole disk, are directed inwards, with the disk-averaged radial velocities typically amounting to a few percent of the disk-averaged rotational velocities. This is significantly lower than the expectations from various models that analytically predict the inward mass transport as driven by torques associated with disk instability. Under certain simplifying assumptions, the latter typically predict average inflows of more than $10\%$ of the rotational velocities. Analyzing the radial motions of streams and off-stream material, we find that the radial inflow in VELA disks is dominated by the stream inflows themselves, especially in the outer disks. The high inward radial velocities inferred in observed disks at cosmic noon, at the level of $\sim \! 20\%$ of the rotational velocities, may reflect inflowing streams from the cosmic web rather than being generated by disk instability.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: Metallicity Gradients in Galaxies at $z\sim1$ with JWST/NIRSpec Slit-stepping Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 26 galaxies at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.7$ from the MSA-3D survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of $R\simeq2700$. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from $-$0.05 to 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at $z\sim1$ with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more "disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4151 during Outburst Stage. II. Four Season Observation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the \ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii\ emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an ``anti-breathing" phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or non-virialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales within one year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the \hb\ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius-luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multi-line RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.</description>

      <title>Lyman Limit System with O VI in the Circumgalactic Environment of a Pair of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the analysis of a multiphase Lyman limit system (LLS) at $z=0.39047$ identified towards the background quasar FBQS J0209-0438. The O VI doublet lines associated with this absorber have a different profile from the low ionization metals and the H I. The Ly$\alpha$ has a very broad H I ($b \approx 150$ km s$^{-1}$) component well-aligned with one of the O VI components. The Doppler $b$-parameters for the broad H I and O VI indicate gas with $T= (0.8-2.0)\times 10^6$ K, and a total hydrogen column density that is an order of magnitude larger than the cooler phase of gas responsible for the LLS. Observations by VLT/MUSE show two moderately star-forming galaxies within $\rho \lesssim 105$ kpc, and $|\Delta v|\lesssim 130$ km s$^{-1}$ of the absorber, one of them a dwarf galaxy ($M_*\approx 10^6$ M$_\odot$) overlapping with the quasar PSF, and the other a larger galaxy ($R_{1/2}\approx 4$ kpc) with $M_*\approx 3\times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_h\approx 7\times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, and the dwarf galaxy within its virial radius. Though the absorption is aligned with the extended major axis of the larger galaxy, the line-of-sight velocity of the absorbing gas is inconsistent with corotating accretion. The metallicity inferred for the LLS is lower than the gas phase [O/H] of the two galaxies. The mixture of cool and warm/hot gas phases for the absorbing gas and its proximity and orientation to the galaxy pair points to the LLS being a high-velocity gas in the combined halo environment of both galaxies.</description>

      <title>3D Morphology and Motions of the Canis Major Region from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canis Major (CMa) region is known for its prominent arc-shaped morphology, visible at multiple wavelengths. This study integrates molecular gas data with high-precision astrometric parameters of young stellar objects (YSOs) from Gaia DR3 to provide the first three-dimensional (3D) insights into the dynamical evolution and star formation history of the CMa region. By utilizing the average distances and proper motions of the YSOs as proxies for those of the molecular clouds (MCs), we confirm the presence of a slowly expanding shell-like morphology in the CMa region, with the estimated radius of 47$\pm$11 pc and expansion velocity of 1.6$\pm$0.7 km/s. Further, the dynamical evolution of the shell supports its expansion, with an expansion timescale of $\sim$4.4 Myr obtained by the traceback analysis assuming constant velocities. Finally, a momentum estimate suggests that at least 2 supernova explosions (SNe) are needed to power the observed expanding shell, reinforcing the previous hypothesis of multiple SNe events. This study effectively combines the CO data with the astrometric data of YSOs from Gaia, offering significant support for the future studies on the 3D morphology and kinematics of MCs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray induced sputtering of interstellar formaldehyde ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H2CO is a ubiquitous molecule in the ISM and in the gas phase of prestellar cores, and is likely present in ice mantles, but its main desorption mechanism is unknown. In this paper our aim is to quantify the desorption efficiency of H2CO upon cosmic-ray impact in order to determine whether cosmic-ray induced sputtering could account for the H2CO abundance observed in prestellar cores. Using a heavy-ion beam as a cosmic-ray analogue at the GANIL accelerator, we irradiated pure H2CO ice films at 10 K under high vacuum conditions and monitored the ice film evolution with infrared spectroscopy and the composition of the sputtered species in the gas phase using mass spectrometry. We derived both the effective and intact sputtering yield of pure H2CO ices. We find that H2CO easily polymerises under heavy-ion irradiation in the ice, and is also radiolysed into CO and CO2. In the gas phase, the dominant sputtered species is CO and intact H2CO is only a minor species. We determine an intact sputtering yield for pure H2CO ices $2.5\times 10^3$ molecules ion$^{-1}$ for an electronic stopping power of $S_e\sim2830$ eV ($10^{15}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$. The corresponding cosmic-ray sputtering rate is $\Gamma_\mathrm{CRD}=1.5\times 10^{-18}\zeta$ molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, where $\zeta$ is the rate of cosmic-ray ionisation of molecular hydrogen in the ISM. In the frame of a simple steady-state chemical model of freeze-out and non-thermal desorption, we find that this experimental cosmic-ray sputtering rate is too low (by an order of magnitude) to account for the observed H2CO gas-phase abundance we derived in the prestellar core L1689B. We find however that this abundance can be reproduced if we assume that H2CO diluted in CO or CO2 ices co-desorbs at the same sputtering rate as pure CO or pure CO2 ices.</description>

      <title>Diffuse interstellar bands as dust indicators: the contribution from 3D maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used 3D maps of 862nm DIB equivalent width (EW) and extinction, DIB catalogues, and measured parameters of dust extinction law and dust emission to study relationships between DIB and extinction level, total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv, dust emission spectral index beta. We revisited the link between several DIBs and the 220nm absorption bump. The ratio, DIBn862, between the 862nm DIB carrier density and the extinction density is increasing in low density clouds, confirming with local values the line-of-sight data. A fitted power law ranks this DIB in the high increase range among the 20 bands measured toward SDSS targets. Using map-integrated 862nm DIB EWs and extinctions along the paths to APOGEE targets with proxies R'v for Rv, we found that DIBn862 increases with R'v for low to moderate extinctions (Av&lt;2-3 mag). Based on stars outside the thin disk, DIBn862 is found to be globally anti-correlated with the Planck opacity spectral index beta. In the light of a recent result on the variability of the carbon/silicate ratio in dust grains as a source of the Rv-beta anti-correlation, it suggests that DIBn862 increases with this ratio, in agreement with the carbonaceous nature of carriers and recent evidences for a spatial correlation between DIBn862 and carbon-rich ejecta of AGBs. At higher Av, both trends disappear. We found that two factors explain the absence of clear results on the link between the UV absorption bump height and DIBs: the correlation disappears when we move from sigma- to zeta-type DIBs and/or from single-cloud lines of sight to paths crossing multiple clouds distant from each other. We show examples of simple models of the bump height based on DIBs. We found an anti-correlation between DIBn and the bump width, similarly disappearing from sigma- to zeta-type DIBs. This suggests that a fraction of the bump is generated outside the dense molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The stellar population of a $z\sim3.25$ Ly$\alpha$ emitting group associated with a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared observations, acquired with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), of a Ly$\alpha$ double-clumped emitting nebula at $z \approx 3.25$ associated with a damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber (DLA). With the WFC3/F160W data we observe the stellar continuum around $3600$ $\mathring{\rm A}$ in the rest frame for a galaxy embedded in the West clump of the nebula, $G_{\rm W}$, for which we estimate a star formation rate SFR$_{G_{\rm W}} = 5.0 \pm 0.4$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and maximum stellar mass M$_{G_{\rm W}} &lt; 9.9 \pm 0.7 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. With the enhanced spatial resolution of HST, we discover the presence of an additional faint source, $G_{\rm E}$, in the center of the East clump, with a star formation rate of SFR$_{G_{\rm E}} = 0.70 \pm 0.20$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and maximum stellar mass M$_{G_{\rm E}} &lt; 1.4 \pm 0.4 \times 10^9$ M$_\odot$. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ emission in the two clumps can be explained by recombination following in-situ photoionization by the two galaxies, assuming escape fractions of ionizing photons of $\lesssim 0.24$ for $G_{\rm W}$ and $\lesssim 0.34$ for $G_{\rm E}$. The fact that $G_{\rm W}$ is offset by $\approx 8$ kpc from the West clump does not fully rule out the presence of additional fainter star-forming sources that would further contribute to the photon budget inside this $\approx 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ galaxy group that extends over a region encompassing over $30 \times 50$ kpc.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Catalog of UVIT Observations I: Catalog Description and First Release of Source Catalog (UVIT DR1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive source catalog (UVIT DR1) of ultraviolet (UV) photometry in four far-UV (FUV $\sim$1300$-$1800 \AA) and five near-UV (NUV $\sim$2000$-$3000 \AA) filters of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board {\em AstroSat}. UVIT DR1 includes bright UV sources in 291 fields that UVIT detected during its first two years of pointed observation, encompassing an area of 58 square degrees. We used the {\sc ccdlab} pipeline to reduce the L1 data, source-extractor for source detection, and four photometric procedures to determine the magnitudes of the detected sources. We provided the 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ detection limits for all the filters of UVIT. We describe the details of observation, source extraction methods, and photometry procedures applied to prepare the catalog. In the final UVIT DR1 catalog, we have point sources, extended sources, clumps from nearby galaxies, There are 239,520 unique sources in the combined UVIT DR1, of which 70,488 sources have FUV magnitudes, and 211,410 have NUV magnitudes. We cross-matched and compared non-crowded sources of UVIT with the {\em Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)} and {\em Gaia} source catalogs. We provide a clean catalog of the unique sources in various UVIT filters that will help further multi-wavelength scientific analysis of the objects.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Milky Way "Bones": Ubiquitous HI Narrow Self-Absorption Associated with CO Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long and skinny molecular filaments running along Galactic spiral arms are known as "bones", since they make up the skeleton of the Milky Way. However, their origin is still an open question. Here, we compare spectral images of HI taken by FAST with archival CO and Herschel dust emission to investigate the conversion from HI to H$_2$ in two typical Galactic bones, CFG028.68-0.28 and CFG047.06+0.26. Sensitive FAST HI images and an improved methodology enabled us to extract HI narrow self-absorption (HINSA) features associated with CO line emission on and off the filaments, revealing the ubiquity of HINSA towards distant clouds for the first time. The derived cold HI abundances, [HI]/[H$_2$], of the two bones range from $\sim$(0.5 to 44.7)$\times10^{-3}$, which reveal different degrees of HI-H$_2$ conversion and are similar to that of nearby, low-mass star forming clouds, Planck Galactic cold clumps and a nearby active high-mass star forming region G176.51+00.20. The HI-H$_2$ conversion has been ongoing for 2.2 to 13.2 Myr in the bones, a timescale comparable to that of massive star formation therein. Therefore, we are witnessing young giant molecular clouds with rapid massive star formation. Our study paves the way of using HINSA to study cloud formation in Galactic bones, and more generally, in distant giant molecular clouds, in the FAST era.</description>

      <title>An X-ray Significantly Variable, Luminous, Type 2 Quasar at z = 2.99 with a Massive Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive X-ray analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of WISEA J171419.96+602724.6, an extremely luminous type 2 quasar at $z$ = 2.99. The source was suggested as a candidate Compton-thick (column density N$_{\rm H}&gt;$1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) quasar by a short XMM-Newton observation in 2011. We recently observed the source with deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton exposures in 2021 and found that the source has a lower obscuration of N$_{\rm H}\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an about four times lower flux. The two epochs of observations suggested that the source was significantly variable in X-ray obscuration, flux, and intrinsic luminosity at 2-3~$\sigma$ in less than 2.5 years (in the source rest frame). We performed SED fitting of this source using CIGALE thanks to its great availability of multiwavelength data (from hard X-rays to radio). The source is very luminous with a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm BOL}\sim$ 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Its host galaxy has a huge star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim$1280 Solar mass yr$^{-1}$ and a huge stellar mass of $\sim$1.1 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ Solar mass. The correlation between the SFR and stellar mass of this source is consistent with what was measured in the high-$z$ quasars. It is also consistent with what was measured in the main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the presence of the active nucleus in our target does not enhance or suppress the SFR of its host galaxy. The source is an Infrared hyper-luminous, obscured galaxy with significant amount of hot dust in its torus and shares many similar properties with hot, dust obscured galaxies.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of the Radial Distribution of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is surrounded by dozens of satellite galaxies, with six-dimensional (6D) phase space information measured for over 80% of this population. The spatial distribution of these satellites is an essential probe of galaxy formation and for mapping the MW's underlying dark matter distribution. Using measured 6D phase space information of known MW satellites, we calculate orbital histories in a joint MW+LMC potential, including the gravitational influence of the LMC on all satellites, on the MW's center of mass, and dynamical friction owing to both galaxies, to investigate the evolution of the MW's cumulative radial profile. We conclude radial profiles become more concentrated over time when we consider the LMC's gravitational influence and the group infall of LMC-associated satellites. The MW's radial distribution is consistently more concentrated at present-day, 1 Gyr, and 2 Gyr ago compared to recent surveys of nearby MW-like systems. Compared to MW-mass hosts in cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we find the MW's radial profile is also more concentrated than those of simulated counterparts; however, some overlap exists between simulation results and our analysis of the MW's satellite distribution 2 Gyr ago, pre-LMC infall. Finally, we posit radial profiles of simulated MW-mass analogs also hosting an LMC companion are likely to evolve similarly to our results, such that the accretion of a massive satellite along with its satellites will lead to a more concentrated radial profile as the massive satellite advances toward its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Between Dust and Gas Contents in Molecular Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds are regions of dense gas and dust in space where new stars and planets are born. There is a strong correlation between the distribution of dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds. The present work focuses on the three-dimensional morphological comparisons between dust and gas within 567 molecular clouds identified in previously published catalog. We confirm a sample of 112 molecular clouds, where the cloud morphology based on CO observations and dust observations displays good overall consistency. There are up to 334 molecular clouds whose dust distribution might be related to the distribution of gas. We are unable to find gas structures that correlate with the shape of the dust distribution in 24 molecular clouds. For the 112 molecular clouds where the dust distribution correlates very well with the distribution of gas, we use CO observational data to measure the physical properties of these molecular clouds and compare them with the results derived from dust, exploring the correlation between gas and dust in the molecular clouds. We found that the gas and dust in the molecular clouds have a fairly good linear relationship, with a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) of $\mathrm{GDR}=(2.80_{-0.34}^{+0.37})\times10^{21}\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\, mag^{-1}}$. The ratio varies considerably among different molecular clouds. We measured the scale height of dust-CO clouds exhibiting strong correlations, finding $h_{Z} = 43.3_{-3.5}^{+4.0}\mathrm{\,pc}$.</description>

      <title>Survey of Non-thermal Electron around Supermassive Black Holes through Polarization Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically thick non-thermal synchrotron sources notably produce linear polarization vectors being parallel to projected magnetic field lines on the observer's screen, although they are perpendicular in well-known optically thin cases. To elucidate the complex relationship between the vectors and fields and to investigate the energy and spatial distribution of non-thermal electrons through the images, we perform polarization radiative transfer calculations at submillimeter wavelengths. Here the calculations are based on semi-analytic force-free jet models with non-thermal electrons with a power-law energy distribution. In calculated images, we find a $90^\circ$-flip of linear polarization (LP) vectors at the base of counter-side (receding) jet near a black hole, which occurs because of large optical depths for synchrotron self-absorption effect. The $90^\circ$-flip of LP vectors is also seen on the photon ring at a high frequency, since the optical depth along the rays is large there due to the light bending effect. In addition, we see the flip of the sign of circular polarization (CP) components on the counter jet and photon ring. Furthermore, we show that these polarization flips are synthesized with large values in the spectral index map, and also give rise to outstanding features in the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) map. Since the conditions of flipping depend on the magnetic field strength and configuration and the energy distribution of electrons, we can expect that the polarization flips will provide us with an observational evidence for the presence of non-thermal electrons around the black hole, and a clue to the magnetically driving mechanism of plasma jets.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Accretion Disk Reflection Model: High-Density Plasma Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous accretion disks around black holes are expected to have densities of $\sim 10^{15-22}\,$cm$^{-3}$, which are high enough such that plasma physics effects become important. Many of these effects have been traditionally neglected in the calculation of atomic parameters, and therefore from photoionization models, and ultimately also from X-ray reflection models. In this paper, we describe updates to the atomic rates used by the XSTAR code, which is in turn part of the XILLVER disk reflection model. We discuss the effect of adding necessary high density corrections into the XILLVER code. Specifically, we find that the change of recombination rates play an important role, dominating the differences between model versions. With synthetic spectra, we show that even in a highly ionized state, high density slabs can produce strong iron ($\sim$6.5-9$\,$keV) and oxygen ($\sim0.6-0.8\,$keV) resonance features. The significant iron emission could address the problem of the supersolar iron abundances found in some sources.</description>

      <title>Tuning a PTA in the detection era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review, and possibly revise, their observing campaigns. The source of the GWB is unknown, and it may take years to pin down its nature. An astrophysical ensemble of supermassive binary black holes is one very likely source for the GWB. Evidence for such a background should come in the form of detectable anisotropies in the GWB and resolvable binary signals. A ``single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Earlier studies have shown that the observational strategies for finding single sources are somewhat different than for finding the statistical correlations needed for the detection of a stochastic background. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. The importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, will be discussed as one of the most important sources of noise in the observational era of PTAs.</description>

      <title>Detection of the [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission line. Low-ionization structures in NGC 7009</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first spatially resolved detection of the near-infrared [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission from the outer pair of low-ionization structures in the planetary nebula NGC 7009 from data obtained by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field unit. This atomic carbon emission marks the transition zone between ionized and neutral gas, and for the first time offers direct evidence that LISs are photodominated regions. The outer LIS pair exhibits intense [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is absent. Conversely, the inner pair of knots shows both lines, likely due to the host nebula emission. Furthermore, the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is absent in the host nebula emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is present. Although the origin of the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is still debated, its detection supports the scenario of photoevaporated dense molecular clumps.</description>

      <title>[Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m imaging survey of planetary nebulae with low-ionisation structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-ionisation structures (LISs) are commonly found in planetary nebulae (PNe) but they are still poorly understood. The recent discovery of unforeseen molecular hydrogen gas (H2) has changed what we think we know about these microstructures and PNe. For an overall understanding of LISs, an [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m imagery survey in PNe with LISs was carried out with the aim to detect the [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m emission line, a common tracer of shocks. We present the first detection of [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m line directly associated with the LISs in four out of five PNe. The theoretical H I 12-4 recombination line is also computed either from the Br$\gamma$ or the H$\beta$ line and subtracted from the observed narrowband line fluxes. [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m flux ranges from 1 to 40x10$^{-15}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the surface brightness from 2 to 90x10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. The R(Fe)=[Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m/Br$\gamma$ line ratio is also computed and varies between 0.5 and 7. In particular, the [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m line is detected in NGC 6543 (R(Fe)&lt;0.15), the outer pairs of LISs in NGC 7009 (R(Fe)&lt;0.25), the jet-like LISs in IC 4634 (R(Fe)$\sim$1) and in several LISs in NGC 6571 (2&lt;R(Fe)&lt;7). The low R(Fe) in NGC 6543 is attributed to the UV radiation from the central star. Contrarily, the higher values in NGC 6571 and IC 4634 are indicative to shocks. The moderate R(Fe) in NGC 7009 likely indicates the contribution of both mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Radio interferometry is a powerful technique that allows astronomers to create high-resolution images of astronomical objects. The distribution of radio telescopes in an interferometer is a critical factor that determines the resolution and sensitivity of the instrument. Traditionally, radio telescopes are distributed in a linear or circular array. However, recent work has shown that using a golden spiral distribution can improve the resolution and sensitivity of an interferometer. In this paper, the author proposes the use of a golden spiral distribution for radio interferometry, showing that a golden spiral distribution can provide a significant improvement in resolution, up to a factor of eight, compared to a linear or circular distribution. The author also proposes that a golden spiral distribution can improve the sensitivity of an interferometer; it may provide a more uniform distribution of radio telescopes than a linear or circular distribution (a known propety of spiral distributions).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population III stars are characterized by extremely low metallicities as they are thought to be formed from a pristine gas in the early Universe. Although the existence of Population III stars is widely accepted, the lack of direct observational evidence hampers the study of the nature of the putative stars. In this article, we explore the possibilities of constraining the nature of the oldest stars by using the luminosity function of their remnants -- white dwarfs. We study the formation and evolution of white dwarf populations by following star formation in a Milky Way-like galaxy using the semi-analytic model A-SLOTH. We derive the white dwarf luminosity function by applying a linear Initial-Final Mass Relation and Mestel's cooling model. The obtained luminosity function is generally in agreement with available observations and theoretical predictions -- with an exponential increase to a maximum of Mabs = 16 and a sudden drop for Mabs &gt; 16. We explore the uncertainties of our model and compare them to the observational estimates. We adopt two different models of the initial mass function of Population III stars to show that the faint end of the luminosity function imprints the signature of Population III remnants. If the feature is detected in future observations, it would provide a clue to Population III stars and would also be an indirect evidence of low- to intermediate-mass Population III stars. We discuss the challenges and prospects for detecting the signatures.</description>

      <title>Influence of planets on debris discs in star clusters -- II. The impact of stellar density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of planetary systems in star clusters with different initial stellar densities, to investigate the impact of the density on debris disc dynamics. We use LPS+ to combine N-body codes NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND for simulations. We simulate debris discs with and without a Jupiter-mass planet at 50 au, in star clusters with N = 1k - 64k stars. The spatial range of the remaining planetary systems decreases with increasing N. As cluster density increases, the planet's influence range first increases and then decreases. For debris particles escaping from planetary systems, the probability of their direct ejection from the star cluster decreases as their initial semi-major axis (a0) or the cluster density increases. The eccentricity and inclination of surviving particles increase as cluster density increases. The presence of a planet leads to lower eccentricities and inclinations of surviving particles. The radial density distribution of the remaining discs decays exponentially in sparse clusters. We derive a general expression of the gravitational encounter rate. Our results are unable to directly explain the scarcity of debris discs in star clusters. Nevertheless, given that many planetary systems have multiple planets, the mechanism of the planet-cluster combined gravitational influence on the disc remains appealing as a potential explanation.</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical mechanisms of launching and acceleration of wind from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disk. We focus on the radiation line force driven and magnetic driven wind models, which operate on the accretion disk scale. We review the investigation histories of the two mechanisms and the most new results obtained recently. The ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) found in the hard X-ray bands are believed to directly originate from AGN accretion disks. We review the theoretical works applying the two mechanisms of wind to explain the UFOs. We briefly introduce the propagation of winds on a large scale which is important for AGN wind feedback study. Finally, the roles of wind in AGN feedback are briefly reviewed.</description>

      <title>The impact of baryons on the internal structure of dark matter haloes from dwarf galaxies to superclusters in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship of dark matter haloes in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and their dark-matter-only counterparts. By combining the IllustrisTNG suite and the novel MillenniumTNG simulation, our analysis encompasses a wide range of box size ($50 - 740 \: \rm cMpc$) and mass resolution ($8.5 \times 10^4 - 3.1 \times 10^7 \: \rm M_{\odot}$ per baryonic mass element). This enables us to study the impact of baryons on the concentration-mass relationship in the redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;7$ over an unprecedented halo mass range, extending from dwarf galaxies to superclusters ($\sim 10^{9.5}-10^{15.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the presence of baryons increases the steepness of the concentration-mass relationship at higher redshift, and demonstrate that this is driven by adiabatic contraction of the profile, due to gas accretion at early times, which promotes star formation in the inner regions of haloes. At lower redshift, when the effects of feedback start to become important, baryons decrease the concentration of haloes below the mass scale $\sim 10^{11.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$. Through a rigorous information criterion test, we show that broken power-law models accurately represent the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship, and of the relative difference in the total mass of haloes induced by the presence of baryons. We provide the best-fit parameters of our empirical formulae, enabling their application to models that mimic baryonic effects in dark-matter-only simulations over six decades in halo mass in the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;7$.</description>

      <title>AstroMAE: Redshift Prediction Using a Masked Autoencoder with a Novel Fine-Tuning Architecture</title>

Abstract: Redshift prediction is a fundamental task in astronomy, essential for understanding the expansion of the universe and determining the distances of astronomical objects. Accurate redshift prediction plays a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of the cosmos. Machine learning (ML) methods, renowned for their precision and speed, offer promising solutions for this complex task. However, traditional ML algorithms heavily depend on labeled data and task-specific feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AstroMAE, an innovative approach that pretrains a vision transformer encoder using a masked autoencoder method on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. This technique enables the encoder to capture the global patterns within the data without relying on labels. To the best of our knowledge, AstroMAE represents the first application of a masked autoencoder to astronomical data. By ignoring labels during the pretraining phase, the encoder gathers a general understanding of the data. The pretrained encoder is subsequently fine-tuned within a specialized architecture tailored for redshift prediction. We evaluate our model against various vision transformer architectures and CNN-based models, demonstrating the superior performance of AstroMAEs pretrained model and fine-tuning architecture.</description>

      <title>Full abundance study of two newly discovered barium giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium (Ba) stars are chemically peculiar stars that show enhanced surface abundances of heavy elements produced by the slow-neutron-capture process, the so-called s-process. These stars are not sufficiently evolved to undergo the s-process in their interiors, so they are considered products of binary interactions. Ba stars form when a former Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) companion, which is now a white dwarf, pollutes them with s-process-rich material through mass transfer. This paper presents a detailed chemical characterization of two newly discovered Ba giants. Our main goal is to confirm their status as extrinsic s-process stars and explore potential binarity and white dwarf companions. We obtained high-resolution spectra with UVES on the Very Large Telescope to determine the chemical properties of the targets. We perform line-by-line analyses and measure 22 elements with an internal precision up to 0.04 dex. The binary nature of the targets is investigated through radial velocity variability and spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that both targets are enhanced in all the measured s-process elements, classifying our targets as Ba giants. This is the first time they are classified as such in the literature. Additionally, both stars present a mild enhancement in Eu, but less than in pure s-process elements, suggesting that the sources that polluted them were pure s-process sources. Finally, we confirmed that the two targets are RV variable and likely binary systems. The abundances in these two newly discovered polluted binaries align with classical Ba giants, providing observational constraints to better understand the s-process in AGB stars.</description>

      <title>Fragments of harmony amid apparent chaos: a closer look at the X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions of the galaxy RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are an extreme X-ray variability phenomenon associated with low-mass supermassive black holes. First discovered in the nucleus of the galaxy GSN 069, they have been so far securely detected in five other galaxies, including RX J1301.9+2747. When detected, the out-of-QPE emission (quiescence) is consistent with the high-energy tail of thermal emission from an accretion disk. We present the X-ray and radio properties of RX J1301.9+2747, both in quiescence and during QPEs. We analyse X-ray data taken during five XMM-Newton observations between 2000 and 2022. The last three observations were taken in coordination with radio observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We also make use of EXOSAT, ROSAT, and Chandra archival observations taken between 1983 and 2009. XMM-Newton detected 34 QPEs of which 8 have significantly lower amplitudes than the others. No correlated radio/X-ray variability was observed during QPEs. In terms of timing properties, the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 do not exhibit the striking regularity observed in the discovery source GSN 069. In fact there is no clear repetition pattern between QPEs: the average time separation between their peaks is about four hours, but it can be as short as one, and as long as six hours. The QPE spectral properties of RX J1301.9+2747 as a function of energy are however very similar to those of GSN 069 and of other QPE sources. The quiescent emission of RX J1301.9+2747 is more complex than that of GSN 069, as it requires a soft X-ray excess-like component in addition to the thermal emission from the accretion disk. Its long-term X-ray quiescent flux variations are of low-amplitude and not strictly monotonic, with a general decay over $\sim 22$ years. We discuss our observational results in terms of some of the ideas and models that have been proposed so far for the physical origin of QPEs.</description>

      <title>A broad set of solar and cosmochemical data indicates high C-N-O abundances for the solar system</title>

Abstract: We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs (Barr &amp; Schawmb 2016, Bierson &amp; Nimmo 2019). This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem - an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new dataset from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new dataset. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Ring Galaxies Detected Using Deep Learning with Real and Simulated Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of ring galaxies, which possess an atypical ring-like structure, is crucial for advancing knowledge of black holes and galaxy dynamics. However, current catalogs of ring galaxies are limited, as manual analysis takes months to accumulate an appreciable sample of rings. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify ring galaxies from unclassified samples. A CNN was trained on 100,000 simulated galaxies, transfer learned to a sample of real galaxies, and applied to a previously unclassified dataset to generate a catalog of rings which was then manually verified. Data augmentation with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to simulate images of galaxies was also employed. The resulting catalog contains 1967 ring galaxies. The properties of these galaxies were then estimated from their photometry and compared to the Galaxy Zoo 2 catalog of rings. However, the model's precision is currently limited due to a severe imbalance of rings in real datasets, leading to a significant false-positive rate of 41.1%, which poses challenges for large-scale application in surveys imaging billions of galaxies. This study demonstrates the potential of optimizing ML pipelines with low training data for rare morphologies and underscores the need for further refinements to enhance precision for extensive surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Dust Polarization and the Morphology of Neutral Hydrogen Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filamentary structures in neutral hydrogen (HI) emission are well aligned with the interstellar magnetic field, so HI emission morphology can be used to construct templates that strongly correlate with measurements of polarized thermal dust emission. We explore how the quantification of filament morphology affects this correlation. We introduce a new implementation of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) using spherical harmonic convolutions, which enables efficient quantification of filamentary structure on the sphere. We use this Spherical RHT algorithm along with a Hessian-based method to construct HI-based polarization templates. We discuss improvements to each algorithm relative to similar implementations in the literature and compare their outputs. By exploring the parameter space of filament morphologies with the Spherical RHT, we find that the most informative HI structures for modeling the magnetic field structure are the thinnest resolved filaments. For this reason, we find a $\sim10\%$ enhancement in the $B$-mode correlation with polarized dust emission with higher-resolution HI observations. We demonstrate that certain interstellar morphologies can produce parity-violating signatures, i.e., nonzero $TB$ and $EB$, even under the assumption that filaments are locally aligned with the magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that $B$ modes from interstellar dust filaments are mostly affected by the topology of the filaments with respect to one another and their relative polarized intensities, whereas $E$ modes are mostly sensitive to the shapes of individual filaments.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Fraction in Disk-Like Galaxies Over the Past 10 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an observational study of the dark matter fraction in star-forming disk-like galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 2.5$, selected from publicly available integral field spectroscropic surveys: KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$, KGES, and KROSS. To model the $H\alpha$ kinematics of these galaxies, we employ 3D forward-modelling, which incorporates beam-smearing and inclination corrections, and yields rotation curves. Subsequently, these rotation curves are corrected for gas pressure gradients, resulting in circular velocity curves or `intrinsic' rotation curves. Our final sample comprises of 263 rotationally supported main sequence star-forming galaxies with redshifts ranging from $0.6 \leq z &lt; 2.5$. We estimate the dark matter fraction of these galaxies by subtracting the baryonic mass from the total mass, where the total mass is derived from the intrinsic rotation curves. We provide novel observational evidence, suggesting that at a fixed redshift, the dark matter fraction gradually increases with radius such that the outskirts of galaxies are dark matter dominated, similarly to local star-forming disk galaxies. This observed dark matter fraction exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing redshift and, on average, the fraction within the effective radius (upto outskirts) remains above 50\%, similar to locals. We investigate the relationships between dark matter, baryon surface density, and circular velocity of galaxies. We observe that low stellar mass galaxies, with $\log(M_{\rm star}\ [\mathrm{M_\odot}]) \leq 10.0$, undergo a higher degree of evolution, which may be attributed to the hierarchical merging of galaxies. Most importantly, we discuss several sources of uncertainties and current limitations in the field, as well as their impact on the measurements of dark matter fraction and its trend across galactic scales and cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Merging Hierarchical Triple Black Hole Systems with Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code PETAR. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on their merging inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the TSUNAMI code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Detectable merging inner BBHs for mHz GW detectors LISA/TianQin/Taiji concentrate within $z&lt;3$. More distant sources would be detectable for CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO, which are sensitive from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$Hz to $\mathcal{O}(100)$Hz. Furthermore, compared with merging isolated BBHs, merging inner BBHs affected by dynamical perturbations from tertiary BHs tend to have higher eccentricities, with a significant fraction of sources with eccentricities closing to 1 at mHz bands. GW observations would help constrain formation channels of merging BBHs, whether through isolated evolution or dynamical interaction, by examining eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Osaka Feedback Model III: Cosmological Simulation CROCODILE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce our new cosmological simulation dataset CROCODILE, executed using the GADGET4-Osaka smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. This simulation incorporates an updated supernova (SN) feedback model of Oku et al. (2022) and an active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback model. A key innovation in our SN feedback model is the integration of a metallicity- and redshift-dependent, top-heavy IMF. Our SN model introduces a new consideration that results in an order of magnitude difference in the energy injection rate per unit stellar mass formed at high redshift. The CROCODILE dataset is comprehensive, encompassing a variety of runs with diverse feedback parameters. This allows for an in-depth exploration of the relative impacts of different feedback processes in galactic evolution. Our initial comparisons with observational data, spanning the galaxy stellar mass function, the star formation main sequence, and the mass-metallicity relation, show promising agreement, especially for the Fiducial run. These results establish a solid foundation for our future work. We find that SN feedback is a key driver in the chemical enrichment of the IGM. Additionally, the AGN feedback creates metal-rich, bipolar outflows that extend and enrich the CGM and IGM over a few Mpc scales.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation from near equilibrium configurations: Linear theory and application to tidal stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Placed slightly out of dynamical equilibrium, an isolated stellar system quickly returns towards a steady virialized state. We study this process of collisionless relaxation using the matrix method of linear response theory. We show that the full phase space distribution of the final virialized state can be recovered directly from the disequilibrium initial conditions, without the need to compute the time evolution of the system. This shortcut allows us to determine the final virialized configuration with minimal computational effort. Complementing this result, we develop tools to model the system's full time evolution in the linear approximation. In particular, we show that moments of the velocity distribution can be efficiently computed using a generalized moment matrix. We apply our linear methods to study the relaxation of energy-truncated Hernquist spheres, mimicking the tidal stripping of a cuspy dark matter subhalo. Comparison of our linear predictions against controlled, isolated $N$-body simulations shows agreement at per cent level for the parts of the system where a linear response to the perturbation is expected. We find that relaxation generates a tangential velocity anisotropy in the intermediate regions, despite the initial disequilibrium state having isotropic kinematics. Our results also strengthen the case for relaxation depleting the amplitude of the density cusp, without affecting its asymptotic slope. Finally, we compare the linear theory against $N$-body simulation of tidal stripping on a radial orbit, confirming that the theory still accurately predicts density and velocity dispersion profiles for most of the system.</description>

Abstract: This study focuses on determining the characteristics of the young open cluster NGC 6383. To achieve this, the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm is utilized to identify potential cluster members based on proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 3. Various parameters of NGC 6383, such as tidal radius, core radius, distance through parallax and isochrone-fitting, proper motion, age, metallicity, and relevant others, are assessed. To perform this analysis, we utilize an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler. The results of this analysis point out that NGC 6383 is a very young open cluster $(\sim 1 - 4~\mathrm{Myr})$, with a distance of $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{kpc}$.</description>

      <title>The rate and contribution of mergers to mass assembly from NIRCam observations of galaxy candidates up to 13.3 billion years ago</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the galaxy merger rate in the redshift range $4.0&lt;z&lt;9.0$ (i.e. about 1.5 to 0.5 Gyr after the Big Bang) based on visually identified galaxy mergers from morphological parameter analysis. Our dataset is based on high-resolution NIRCam JWST data (a combination of F150W and F2000W broad-band filters) in the low-to-moderate magnification ($\mu&lt;2$) regions of the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a parent set of 675 galaxies $(M_{U}\in[-26.6,-17.9])$, we identify 64 merger candidates from the Gini, $M_{20}$ and Asymmetry morphological parameters, leading to a merger fraction $f_m=0.11\pm0.04$. There is no evidence of redshift evolution of $f_m$ even at the highest redshift considered, thus extending well into the epoch of reionization the constant trend seen previously at $z\lesssim 6$. Furthermore, we investigate any potential redshift dependent differences in the specific star formation rates between mergers and non-mergers. Our analysis reveals no significant correlation in this regard, with deviations in the studied redshift range typically falling within $(1-1.5)\sigma$ from the null hypotesis that can be attributed to sample variance and measurement errors. Finally, we also demonstrate that the classification of a merging system is robust with respect to the observed (and equivalently rest-frame) wavelength of the high-quality JWST broad-band images used. This preliminary study highlights the potential for progress in quantifying galaxy assembly through mergers during the epoch of reionization, with significant sample size growth expected from upcoming large JWST infrared imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>Imprints of the Local Bubble and Dust Complexity on Polarized Dust Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ($80'$) scales. We test recent models that assume that the magnetic field probed by the polarized dust emission is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sightlines with similar total column densities and find that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the dust polarization fraction is higher for sightlines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. In conclusion, we find that the extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction at 80$'$. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Inhibited destruction of dust by supernova in a clumpy medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decrease rate of dust mass due to strong shock waves ($v_s\geq 150$ km s$^{-1}$) from supernovae (SNe) estimated for the Milky Way interstellar medium significantly exceeds the overall production rate by both asymptotic giant branch stars and core collapse SNe. The interplay between the production and destruction rates is critically important for evaluation of the net dust outcome from SNe at different conditions. In light of this, we study the dynamics of initially polydisperse dust grains pre-existing in an ambient medium swept up the SN shock front depending on magnitude of inhomogeneity (clumpiness) in the medium. We find that dust destruction inside the bubble is inhibited in more inhomogeneous medium: the larger amount of dust survives for the higher dispersion of density. This trend is set by the interrelation between radiative gas cooling and dust sputtering in different environment. After several radiative times the mass fraction of the survived dust saturates at the level almost independent on the gas mean density. We note that for more clumpy medium the distributions of dust over thermal phases of a gas inside the bubble and over sizes are smoother and flatter in comparison with those in a nearly homogeneous medium.</description>

      <title>An optically-dark merging system at z~6 detected by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near- to mid-Infrared observations (from Spitzer and JWST) have revealed a hidden population of galaxies at redshift z=3-6, called optically-dark objects, which are believed to be massive and dusty star-formers. While optically-dark sources are widely recognized as a significant component of the stellar mass function, the history of their stellar mass assembly remains unexplored. However, they are thought to be the progenitors of the more massive early-type galaxies found in present-day groups and clusters. It is thus important to examine the possible connection between dark sources and merging events, in order to understand the environment in which they live. Here, we report our search for close companions in a sample of 19 optically-dark objects identified in the SMACS0723 JWST deep field. They were selected in the NIRCam F444W band and undetected below 2mu. We restrict our analysis to the reddest (i.e. F277W-F444W&gt; 1.3) and brightest (F444W&lt; 26 mag) objects. We have identified an optically-dark source showing a very close companion (&lt;0.5"). The spatially resolved SED fitting procedure indicates that all components lying within 1.5" from the dark source are indeed at z~5.7. Tidal features (leading to a whale shaped morphology) corroborate the hypothesis that the dark source is the most massive (log(M/Msun)&gt;10.3) and dusty (Av~3 at the core) system of an ongoing merger with a mass ratio of ~10. Similar merging systems are identified in the SERRA simulations, allowing us to reconstruct their stellar mass assembly history and predict their molecular gas properties The discovery of mergers within dark galaxies at the end of the Epoch of Reionization underscores the importance of conducting a statistical search for additional candidates in deep NIRCam fields. Such research will aid in understanding the role of merging processes during the obscured phase of stellar mass accumulation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Radial Profile of Galactic Magnetic Fields using Rotation Measure of Background Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing magnetic fields in high-redshift galactic systems is crucial to investigate galactic dynamics and evolution. Utilizing the rotation measure of the background quasars, we have developed a radial profile of the magnetic field in a typical high-$z$ galaxy. We have compiled a catalog of 59 confirmed quasar sightlines, having one intervening Mg \rom{2} absorber in the redshift range $0.372\leq z_{\text{abs}} \leq 0.8$. The presence of the foreground galaxy is ensured by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts within $3 \sigma_{z-\text{photo}}$ and visual checks. These quasar line-of-sights (LoS) pass through various impact parameters (D) up to $160$ kpc, covering the circumgalactic medium of a typical Milky-Way type galaxy. Utilizing the residual rotation measure (RRM) of these sightlines, we estimated the excess in RRM dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$. We found $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ decreases with increasing D. We translated $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ to average LoS magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ by considering a typical electron column density. Consequently, the decreasing trend is sustained in the magnetic field. In particular for sightlines with $\text{D} \leq 50$ kpc and $\text{D} &gt; 50$ kpc, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ is found to be $2.39 \pm 0.7 \ \mu$G and $1.67 \pm 0.38 \ \mu$G, respectively. This suggests a clear indication of varying magnetic field from the disk to the circumgalactic medium. This work provides a methodology that, when applied to ongoing and future radio polarisation surveys such as LOFAR and SKA, promises to significantly enhance our understanding of magnetic field mapping in galactic systems.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Hole Seeds</title>

Abstract: The pathway(s) to seeding the massive black holes (MBHs) that exist at the heart of galaxies in the present and distant Universe remains an unsolved problem. Here we categorise, describe and quantitatively discuss the formation pathways of both $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds. We emphasise that the most recent computational models suggest that rather than a bimodal-like mass spectrum between $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds with $\textit{light}$ at one end and $\textit{heavy}$ at the other that instead a continuum exists. $\textit{Light}$ seeds being more ubiquitous and the heavier seeds becoming less and less abundant due the rarer environmental conditions required for their formation. We therefore examine the different mechanisms that give rise to different seed mass spectrums. We show how and why the mechanisms that produce the $\textit{heaviest}$ seeds are also among the rarest events in the Universe and are hence extremely unlikely to be the seeds for the vast majority of the MBH population. We quantify, within the limits of the current large uncertainties in the seeding processes, the expected number densities of the seed mass spectrum. We argue that $\textit{light}$ seeds must be at least $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}$ times more numerous than $\textit{heavy}$ seeds to explain the MBH population as a whole. Based on our current understanding of the seed population this makes $\textit{heavy}$ seeds ($\rm{M_{seed}} &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) a significantly more likely pathway given that $\textit{heavy}$ seeds have an abundance pattern than is close to and likely in excess of $10^{-4}$ compared to $\textit{light}$ seeds. Finally, we examine the current state-of-the-art in numerical calculations and recent observations and plot a path forward for near-future advances in both domains.</description>

      <title>Observation of HI around three satellite galaxies of the M31 with the FAST: Andromeda II, NGC 205, and NGC 185</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exceptional sensitivity of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conducted observations of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the circumgalactic medium of Andromeda's (M31) satellite galaxies, specifically Andromeda II, NGC 205, and NGC 185. Initially, three drift scans were executed for these satellites, with a detection limit of $4\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ ( approximately $1.88\times10^3 M_{\odot}$ of HI mass), followed by a more in-depth scan of a specific region. We discovered a C-shaped HI arc structure sharing a position and line-of-sight velocity similar to a stellar ring structure around Andromeda II, hinting at a potential connection with Andromeda II. In the context of NGC 205, we identified two mass concentrations in the northeast direction, which could be indicative of tidal streams resulting from the interaction between this galaxy and M31. These new lumps discovered could be very helpful in solving the missing interstellar medium (ISM) problem for NGC 205. Observations regarding NGC 185 are consistent with previous studies, and we did not detect any additional HI material around this galaxy. These observational results enhance our understanding of the evolution of these satellite galaxies and provide insight into their historical interactions with the galaxy M31.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal analytical model for Population III star formation: interplay between feedback and fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has brought us new insights into Cosmic Dawn with tentative detection of the unique signatures of metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, such as strong HeII emission, extremely blue UV spectrum, and enhanced nitrogen abundance. Self-consistent theoretical predictions of the formation rates, sites, and masses of Pop III stars are crucial for interpreting the observations, but are challenging due to complex physical processes operating over the large range of length scales involved. One solution is to combine analytical models for the small-scale star formation process with cosmological simulations that capture the large-scale physics such as structure formation, radiation backgrounds, and baryon-dark matter streaming motion that regulate the conditions of Pop III star formation. We build an analytical model to predict the final masses of Pop III stars/clusters from the properties of star-forming clouds, based on the key results of small-scale star formation simulations and stellar evolution models. Our model for the first time considers the interplay between feedback and fragmentation and covers different modes of Pop III star formation ranging from ordinary small ($\sim 10-2000\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters in molecular-cooling clouds to massive ($\gtrsim 10^{4}\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters containing supermassive ($\sim 10^{4}-3\times 10^{5}\ \rm M_\odot$) stars under violent collapse of atomic-cooling clouds. As an example, the model is applied to the Pop III star-forming clouds in the progenitors of typical haloes hosting high-$z$ luminous quasars, which shows that formation of Pop III massive clusters is common ($\sim 20-70\%$) in such biased ($\sim4\sigma$) regions, and the resulting heavy black hole seeds from supermassive stars can account for a significant fraction of observed luminous ($\gtrsim 10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) quasars at $z\sim 6$.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy mergers represent a fundamental physical process under hierarchical structure formation, but their role in triggering AGNs is still unclear. We aim to investigate the merger-AGN connection using state-of-the-art observations and novel methods in detecting mergers and AGNs. We selected stellar mass-limited samples at redshift z&lt;1 from KiDS, focusing on the KiDS-N-W2 field with a wide range of multi-wavelength data. Three AGN types, selected in the MIR, X-ray, and via SED modelling, were analysed. To identify mergers, we used convolutional neural networks trained on two cosmological simulations. We created mass and redshift-matched control samples of non-mergers and non-AGNs. We observe a clear AGN excess (a factor of 2-3) in mergers with respect to non-mergers for the MIR AGNs, and a mild excess for the X-ray and SED AGNs, indicating that mergers could trigger all 3 types but are more connected with the MIR AGNs. About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear whether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are unlikely to be the dominant trigger. We also explore the relation using the continuous AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$ parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of high $f_{AGN}$ values relative to non-mergers, for all AGNs. We unveil the first merger fraction $f_{merg}-f_{AGN}$ relation with two distinct regimes. When the AGN is not dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even flat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest $f_{merg}$. In the regime of very dominant AGNs ($f_{AGN}\geq0.8$), $f_{merg}$ shows a steeply rising trend with increasing $f_{AGN}$ for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted against AGN bolometric luminosity. We conclude that mergers are most connected with dust-obscured AGNs (linked to a fast-growing phase of the SMBH) and are the main or even the sole fuelling mechanism of the most powerful AGNs.</description>

      <title>The densities in diffuse and translucent molecular clouds: estimates from observations of C$_2$ and from 3-dimensional extinction maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newly-computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C$_2$ in collisions with H$_2$, presented recently by Najar and Kalugina (2020), are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C$_2$ molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C$_2$ rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C$_2$ towards a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C$_2$ absorption are a factor 4 to 7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar and Kalugina (2020). These lower density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sightlines. In cases where H$_3^+$ absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the H$_3^+$ abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we revisit the derivation of hydrostatic mass of GCs within modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We also derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, and beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG). We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. For a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG, $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ for EiBI theory, and $\Upsilon=-0,1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG. We also compare our results with the GCs' baryonic masses $M_{bar}$. In this comparison, only the MENG formulation with $\beta_{0}=2.70\times 10^{115}$ produces the best linear fit with the slope $\frac{M_{MENG}}{M_{bar}}=0.755\pm0.061$. This means that in this work, MENG is the best theory of gravity that alleviates the mass discrepancy of hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass of GCs.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos can be subject to gravothermal collapse if the DM is not collisionless, but engaged in strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with observations requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. Collapsed halos are extreme systems that pose challenges when applying state-of-the-art codes to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems, with a focus on energy non-conservation and discuss possible strategies to avoid them. We ran N-body simulations, with and without SIDM, of an isolated DM-only halo and we adjusted the numerical parameters to check the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for SIDM can lead to energy non-conservation, but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we find are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; and (c) SIDM velocity kicks breaking the time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation allows us to conserve energy not only at early stages of the evolution, but also later on. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some of the problems that make the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, other issues still pose a challenge. Our findings motivate further works on addressing these challenges.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a four-dimensional gravity action and explore the idea that the Einsteinian and galactic laws of gravitation should emerge as two different dynamical phases of the resulting theory. A new set of spacetime solutions exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves are found. These geometries correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. We also provide an explanation of the empirical correlation between the luminosity and the slope of the velocity curve. We find an enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is lesser than the deflection predicted for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>

Abstract: The presence of pre-main-sequence and low-mass stars, combined with the new data from Gaia DR3 and with 2MASS, significantly enhances the relevance of studying this cluster. We aim to accurately identify cluster members, determine fundamental parameters, assess mass segregation, and establish precise age and distance using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS data. We employed Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques, including the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) for member identification, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) from PyMC for modeling, the Sagitta neural network for the identification and age estimation of pre-main sequence stars, and ASteCA for isochrone fitting. We identified 254 probable cluster members with a mode cluster age of $3.53^{+1.40}_{-1.00}$ Myr and a distance of $1.11\pm 0.06$ kpc. The core and tidal radius were determined to be $1.95 \pm 0.19$ and $40.4 \pm 14.3\,\mathrm{arcmin}$, respectively. The analysis revealed primordial mass segregation among binary stars, indicating that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. The color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, suggesting recent star formation activity from approximately 1 to 6 Myr ago. The software used for this investigation is released with the paper. Our analysis provides updated parameters for NGC 6383, confirming relative recent star formation and mass segregation, and demonstrating the effectiveness of combining advanced computational techniques with traditional methods for studying stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Parameter study for hot spot trajectories around Sgr$A*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intense flaring events in the near-infrared and X-ray wavebands of our Galactic Center have been the subject of research for decades. In recent years, the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope captured the motion and polarimetric signature of such a flare in close proximity to the supermassive black hole. This study aims to investigate a broad parameter space for hot spot motion in the vicinity of Sgr$A*$ and reproduce the observed flaring behavior. To this end, we have developed a General Relativistic Radiative Transfer code and conducted a parameter study including both planar and ejected hot spot configurations around supermassive black holes. Super-Keplerian orbital frequencies are favored by circular equatorial, cylindrical and parabolic models, whereas conical hot spot trajectories provide a better fit for orbital frequencies below the Keplerian value. Additionally, a distant observer cannot effectively differentiate between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, as well as face-on orbits at different observation angles.</description>

      <title>The impact of constrained interacting dark energy on the bound-zone velocity profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the effects of constrained interacting dark energy (CIDER) on the bound-zone velocity profiles around massive dark matter halos. Analyzing the CIDER simulations performed by Baldi (2023) for three different cases of dark sector coupling ($\beta=0.03$, $0.05$ and $0.08$) as well as for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology ($\beta=0$), we determine the mean peculiar velocity profiles in the bound zones around the friends-of-friends halos with masses larger than $M_{\rm cut}=3\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at three redshifts, $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$. It is found that the universal power-law formula proposed by Falco et al. (2024) originally for the $\Lambda$CDM case still describes well the bound-zone velocity profiles, $V(r)$, even in the CIDER models. The slope of $V(r)$, turns out to be significantly affected by the CIDER, progressively decreasing as $\beta$ increases. Meanwhile, the amplitude of $V(r)$ exhibits little dependence on $\beta$, which is ascribed to the identical Hubble parameters shared by the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models in the entire redshift range. Our results imply that the bound-zone velocity slope can break a degeneracy even between the $\Lambda$CDM and CIDER models with $\beta\le 0.03$, which the standard cosmological diagnostics fail to distinguish. We devise a simple analytic formula for the bound-zone slope as a function of $\beta$, and prove its validity at all of the three redshifts. It is concluded that the slope of the mean bound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be in principle a powerful probe of dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity. IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>

Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>
