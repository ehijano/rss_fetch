      <title>Non-Invasive Arterial Pulse Detection with Millimeter-wave Radar and Comparison With Photoplethysmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and disability. The convenient measurement of cardiovascular health using smart systems is therefore a key enabler to foster accurate and early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and it require accessing a correct pulse morphology similar to arterial pressure wave. This paper investigates the comparison between different sensor modalities, such as mmWave and photoplethysmography from the same physiological site and reference continuous non-invasive blood pressure devide. We have developed a hardware prototype and established an experiment consist of 23 test participants. Both mmWave and PPG are capable of detecting inter-beat intervals. mmWave is providing more accurate arterial pulse waveform than green photoplethysmography.</description>

      <title>RainfalLTE: A Zero-effect Rainfall Sensing System Utilizing Existing LTE Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental sensing is an important research topic in the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Current works often focus on static environments, such as buildings and terrains. However, dynamic factors like rainfall can cause serious interference to wireless signals. In this paper, we propose a system called RainfalLTE that utilizes the downlink signal of LTE base stations for device-independent rain sensing. In articular, it is fully compatible with current communication modes and does not require any additional hardware. We evaluate it with LTE data and rainfall information provided by a weather radar in Badaling Town, Beijing The results show that for 10 classes of rainfall, RainfalLTE achieves over 97% identification accuracy. Our case study shows that the assistance of rainfall information can bring more than 40% energy saving, which provides new opportunities for the design and optimization of ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Learning for Frequency-Domain Channel Extrapolation under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-domain channel extrapolation is effective in reducing pilot overhead for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Recently, Deep learning (DL) based channel extrapolator has become a promising candidate for modeling complex frequency-domain dependency. Nevertheless, current DL extrapolators fail to operate in unseen environments under distribution shift, which poses challenges for large-scale deployment. In this paper, environment generalizable learning for channel extrapolation is achieved by realizing distribution alignment from a physics perspective. Firstly, the distribution shift of wireless channels is rigorously analyzed, which comprises the distribution shift of multipath structure and single-path response. Secondly, a physics-based progressive distribution alignment strategy is proposed to address the distribution shift, which includes successive path-oriented design and path alignment. Path-oriented DL extrapolator decomposes multipath channel extrapolation into parallel extrapolations of the extracted path, which can mitigate the distribution shift of multipath structure. Path alignment is proposed to address the distribution shift of single-path response in path-oriented DL extrapolators, which eventually enables generalizable learning for channel extrapolation. In the simulation, distinct wireless environments are generated using the precise ray-tracing tool. Based on extensive evaluations, the proposed path-oriented DL extrapolator with path alignment can reduce extrapolation error by more than 6 dB in unseen environments compared to the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Waveform for Next Generation Communication Systems: Comparing Zak-OTFS with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.</description>

      <title>Near-Field RIS-Assisted Localization Under Mutual Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the potential to significantly enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS) blockage scenarios. However, as larger RISs are integrated into ISAC systems, mutual coupling (MC) effects between RIS elements become more pronounced, leading to a substantial degradation in performance, especially for localization applications. In this paper, we first conduct a misspecified and standard Cram\'er-Rao bound analysis to quantify the impact of MC on localization performance, demonstrating severe degradations in accuracy, especially when MC is ignored. Building on this, we propose a novel joint user equipment localization and RIS MC parameter estimation (JLMC) method in near-field wireless systems. Our two-stage MC-aware approach outperforms classical methods that neglect MC, significantly improving localization accuracy and overall system performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>AI-empowered Channel Estimation for Block-based Active IRS-enhanced Hybrid-field IoT Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation (CE) for uplink hybrid-field communications involving multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices assisted by an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is investigated. Firstly, to reduce the complexity of near-field (NF) channel modeling and estimation between IoT devices and active IRS, a sub-blocking strategy for active IRS is proposed. Specifically, the entire active IRS is divided into multiple smaller sub-blocks, so that IoT devices are located in the far-field (FF) region of each sub block, while also being located in the NF region of the entire active IRS. This strategy significantly simplifies the channel model and reduces the parameter estimation dimension by decoupling the high-dimensional NF channel parameter space into low dimensional FF sub channels. Subsequently, the relationship between channel approximation error and CE error with respect to the number of sub blocks is derived, and the optimal number of sub blocks is solved based on the criterion of minimizing the total error. In addition, considering that the amplification capability of active IRS requires power consumption, a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation factor is derived. To further reduce the pilot overhead, a lightweight CE algorithm based on convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and multi-head attention mechanism, called CAEformer, is designed. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed CAEformer network significantly outperforms the conventional least square and minimum mean square error scheme in terms of estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>EM-Based Channel Estimation for mMIMO LEO SATCOM Under Imperfect Doppler Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit communication channels are highly time-varying due to severe Doppler shifts and propagation delays. While satellite-mobility-induced Doppler shifts can be compensated using known ephemeris data, those caused by user mobility require accurate user positioning information; the absence of such information contributes to amplified channel aging in conventional channel estimators. To address this challenge, we propose a data-aided channel estimator based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, combined with a discrete Legendre polynomial basis expansion method (DLP-BEM), to estimate the channel under imperfect Doppler compensation. The EM algorithm iteratively exploits hidden data symbols for improved channel estimation, while DLP-BEM regularizes the process by projecting the channel estimate onto a lower dimensional subspace that mitigates estimation errors. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over existing methods in terms of normalized mean square error and symbol error rate.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM) for Extremely Robust Physical Layer Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM), a novel modulation scheme that can be leveraged to effectively shuffle transmitted data while maintaining symbol error probability (SEP) performance equivalent to unencrypted systems. By utilizing the well-distributed elliptic curve points over the field of large primes, ECM enhances symbol obfuscation, making it a powerful foundation for physical-layer encryption (PLE). Each symbol is mapped from a predefined key while preserving a minimum Euclidean distance constraint, ensuring strong security against adversarial inference without compromising error performance. Building on ECM's strong obfuscation capabilities, we propose ECM with dynamic rotation (ECM-DR) as a practical PLE scheme that achieves near-maximal obfuscation while balancing precomputation complexity. By leveraging a reduced subset of precomputed elliptic curve points and key-based dynamic constellation rotation, ECM-DR ensures that each transmission remains unpredictable, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional PLE schemes without additional computational cost. Security analysis confirms ECM's resilience to brute-force attacks, while numerical results demonstrate its strong obfuscation capabilities. Furthermore, ECM-DR achieves near-maximum information entropy while preserving the SEP performance of unencrypted quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), offering an extremely robust solution for secure wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Outage Probability Analysis of Tunable Liquid Lens-assisted VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a tunable liquid lens (TLL)-assisted indoor mobile visible light communication system. To mitigate performance degradation caused by user mobility and random receiver orientation, an electrowetting cuboid TLL is used at the receiver. By dynamically controlling the orientation angle of the liquid surface through voltage adjustments, signal reception and overall system performance are enhanced. An accurate mathematical framework is developed to model channel gains, and two lens optimization strategies, namely ($i$) the best signal reception (BSR), and ($ii$) the vertically upward lens orientation (VULO) are introduced for improved performance. Closed form expressions for the outage probability are derived for each scheme for practical mobility and receiver orientation conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TLL and lens adjustment strategies significantly reduce the outage probability compared to fixed lens and no lens receivers across various mobility and orientation conditions. Specifically, the outage probability is improved from $1\times 10^{-1}$ to $3\times 10^{-3}$ at a transmit power of $12$ dBW under a $8^{\circ}$ polar angle variation in random receiver orientation using the BSR scheme.</description>

      <title>A precise detection method for transient micro short-circuit faults of lithium-ion batteries through signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A specific failure mode designated as transient micro-short circuit (TMSC) has been identified in practical battery systems, exhibiting subtle and latent characteristics with measurable voltage deviations. To further improve the safe use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), this letter introduces a novel method for the precise detection of this TMSC faults within LIBs. The method applies the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to voltage and current signals, followed by the identification of micro-scale anomalies through the analysis of the coherence in the wavelet spectrum at specific frequency. Through designed fault experiments, the effec-tiveness of this method has been verified. Result demon-strates that it can effectively capture micro-faults with a voltage drop as low as 30 mV within just a few seconds. Furthermore, the proposed method is inherently highly robust and is able to effectively detect false faults and hidden faults under varying current loads, which highlights the superiority of this method.</description>

      <title>A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimization of Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach, the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.</description>

      <title>HDE-Array: Development and Validation of a New Dry Electrode Array Design to Acquire HD-sEMG for Hand Position Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to introduce HDE-Array (High-Density Electrode Array), a novel dry electrode array for acquiring High-Density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) for hand position estimation through RPC-Net (Recursive Prosthetic Control Network), a neural network defined in a previous study. We aim to demonstrate the hypothesis that the position estimates returned by RPC-Net using HD-sEMG signals acquired with HDE-Array are as accurate as those obtained from signals acquired with gel electrodes. We compared the results, in terms of precision of hand position estimation by RPC-Net, using signals acquired by traditional gel electrodes and by HDE-Array. As additional validation, we performed a variance analysis to confirm that the presence of only two rows of electrodes does not result in an excessive loss of information, and we characterized the electrode-skin impedance to assess the effects of the voltage divider effect and power line interference. Performance tests indicated that RPC-Net, used with HDE-Array, achieved comparable or superior results to those observed when used with the gel electrode setup. The dry electrodes demonstrated effective performance even with a simplified setup, highlighting potential cost and usability benefits. These results suggest improvements in the accessibility and user-friendliness of upper-limb rehabilitation devices and underscore the potential of HDE-Array and RPC-Net to revolutionize control for medical and non-medical applications.</description>

      <title>Developing RPC-Net: Leveraging High-Density Electromyography and Machine Learning for Improved Hand Position Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of RPC-Net (Recursive Prosthetic Control Network), a novel method using simple neural network architectures to translate electromyographic activity into hand position with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Methods: RPC-Net uses a regression-based approach to convert forearm electromyographic signals into hand kinematics. We tested the adaptability of the algorithm to different conditions and compared its performance with that of solutions from the academic literature. Results: RPC-Net demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in predicting hand position from electromyographic activity, outperforming other solutions with the same computational cost. Including previous position data consistently improved results across subjects and conditions. RPC-Net showed robustness against a reduction in the number of electromyography electrodes used and shorter input signals, indicating potential for further reduction in computational cost. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that RPC-Net is capable of accurately translating forearm electromyographic activity into hand position, offering a practical and adaptable tool that may be accessible in clinical settings. Significance: The development of RPC-Net represents a significant advancement. In clinical settings, its application could enable prosthetic devices to be controlled in a way that feels more natural, improving the quality of life for individuals with limb loss.</description>

      <title>FIRES: Fluid Integrated Reflecting and Emitting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces the concept of fluid integrated reflecting and emitting surface (FIRES), which constitutes a new paradigm seamlessly integrating the flexibility of fluid-antenna systems (FASs) with the dual functionality of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The potential of the proposed metasurface structure is studied though an FIRES-enabled multicast system based on the energy splitting protocol. In this model, the FIRES is divided into non-overlapping subareas, each functioning as a 'fluid' element capable of concurrent reflection and transmission and changing its position of radiation within the subarea. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem for the design of the triple tunable features of the surface unit elements, which is solved via a tailored particle swarm optimization approach. Our results showcase that the proposed FIRES architecture significantly outperforms its conventional STAR-RIS counterpart.</description>

      <title>U-SAM: An audio language Model for Unified Speech, Audio, and Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features, leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges, this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its generalization potential. Code is available (https://github.com/Honee-W/U-SAM/).</description>

      <title>Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.</description>

      <title>VaN3Twin: the Multi-Technology V2X Digital Twin with Ray-Tracing in the Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents VaN3Twin-the first open-source, full-stack Network Digital Twin (NDT) framework for simulating the coexistence of multiple Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies with accurate physical-layer modeling via ray tracing. VaN3Twin extends the ms-van3t simulator by integrating Sionna Ray Tracer (RT) in the loop, enabling high-fidelity representation of wireless propagation, including diverse Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions with focus on LoS blockage due to other vehicles' meshes, Doppler effect, and site-dependent effects-e.g., scattering and diffraction. Unlike conventional simulation tools, the proposed framework supports realistic coexistence analysis across DSRC and C-V2X technologies operating over shared spectrum. A dedicated interference tracking module captures cross-technology interference at the time-frequency resource block level and enhances signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation by eliminating artifacts such as the bimodal behavior induced by separate LoS/NLoS propagation models. Compared to field measurements, VaN3Twin reduces application-layer disagreement by 50% in rural and over 70% in urban environments with respect to current state-of-the-art simulation tools, demonstrating its value for scalable and accurate digital twin-based V2X coexistence simulation.</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence Optimization of Multi-RIS Aided MmWave Beamspace MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a multiple reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) beamspace multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple users (UEs). We focus on a challenging scenario in which the direct links between the base station (BS) and all UEs are blocked, and communication is facilitated only via RISs. The maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is utilized for data precoding, while a low-complexity algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to jointly perform beam selection, power allocation, and RIS profile configuration. The proposed optimization approach demonstrates positive trade-offs between the complexity (in terms of running time) and the achievable sum rate. In addition, our results demonstrate that due to the sparsity of beamspace channels, increasing the number of unit cells (UCs) at RISs can lead to higher achievable rates than activating a larger number of beams at the MIMO BS.</description>

      <title>A system identification approach to clustering vector autoregressive time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.</description>

      <title>Global Maxwell Tomography Using the Volume-Surface Integral Equation for Improved Estimation of Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a noninvasive inverse optimization method for the estimation of electrical properties (EP) from magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. GMT uses the volume integral equation (VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect on the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields with an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization iterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a novel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral equation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based on updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We simulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and reconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built the coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a two-compartment phantom. Results: In simulations, VSIE-based GMT outperformed VIE-based GMT by at least 12% for both EP. In experiments, the relative difference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer) compartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity, respectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance by accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents. Significance: VSIE-based GMT does not rely on an initial EP estimate, rendering it more suitable for experimental reconstructions compared to the VIE-based GMT.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based, multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization, positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder, Doppler spread, and delay profile.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decoupling Capacitor Optimization for Power Distribution Network of 2.5D ICs with Co-Analysis of Frequency and Time Domains Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing need for higher memory bandwidth and computation density, 2.5D design, which involves integrating multiple chiplets onto an interposer, emerges as a promising solution. However, this integration introduces significant challenges due to increasing data rates and a large number of I/Os, necessitating advanced optimization of the power distribution networks (PDNs) both on-chip and on-interposer to mitigate the small signal noise and simultaneous switching noise (SSN). Traditional PDN optimization strategies in 2.5D systems primarily focus on reducing impedance by integrating decoupling capacitors (decaps) to lessen small signal noises. Unfortunately, relying solely on frequency-domain analysis has been proven inadequate for addressing coupled SSN, as indicated by our experimental results. In this work, we introduce a novel two-phase optimization flow using deep reinforcement learning to tackle both the on-chip small signal noise and SSN. Initially, we optimize the impedance in the frequency domain to maintain the small signal noise within acceptable limits while avoiding over-design. Subsequently, in the time domain, we refine the PDN to minimize the voltage violation integral (VVI), a more accurate measure of SSN severity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual-domain optimization strategy that simultaneously addresses both the small signal noise and SSN propagation through strategic decap placement in on-chip and on-interposer PDNs, offering a significant step forward in the design of robust PDNs for 2.5D integrated systems.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing wireless signal reception through self-adjustable metallic surfaces, termed reflectors, which are guided by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The designed reflector system aims to improve signal quality for multiple users in scenarios where a direct line-of-sight (LOS) from the access point (AP) and reflector to users is not guaranteed. Utilizing DRL techniques, the reflector autonomously modifies its configuration to optimize beam allocation from the AP to user equipment (UE), thereby maximizing path gain. Simulation results indicate substantial improvements in the average path gain for all UEs compared to baseline configurations, highlighting the potential of DRL-driven reflectors in creating adaptive communication environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the synergy of physical layer covert transmission and millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to improve the performance, and enable secure internet of things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we employ a physical layer covert transmission as a prism, which can achieve simultaneously transmitting confidential signals to a covert communication user equipment (UE) in the presence of a warden and regular communication UEs. We design the transmit beamforming to guarantee information transmission security, communication quality-of-service (QoS) and sensing accuracy. By considering two different beamforming architectures, i.e., fully digital beamforming (FDBF) and hybrid beamforming (HBF), an optimal design method and a low-cost beamforming scheme are proposed to address the corresponding problems, respectively. Furthermore, building on the previously derived algorithm, two robust variants are proposed to address the more challenging case where the warden's CSI is imperfect. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FDBF/HBF algorithms compared with traditional algorithms in terms of information transmission security, communication QoS and target detection performance.</description>

      <title>RACNN: Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Near-Field Channel Estimation in 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, where extremely large antenna arrays (ELAA) enable near-field communication (NFC) but introduce significant signal processing complexity. Traditional model-based methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability in large-scale ELAA systems, while existing learning-based approaches often lack robustness across diverse channel conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Residual Attention Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN), which integrates convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction by focusing on key regions within the CNN feature maps. Experimental results show that RACNN outperforms both traditional and learning-based methods, including XLCNet, across various scenarios, particularly in mixed far-field and near-field conditions. Notably, in these challenging settings, RACNN achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 4.8*10^(-3) at an SNR of 20dB, making it a promising solution for near-field channel estimation in 6G.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Beam Training with DFT Codebook based on Beam Pattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating in high-frequency bands have spurred the development of near-field communication, driving advancements in beam training design. This paper introduces an efficient near-field beam training method that utilizes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook traditionally employed for far-field users (FUs). We begin by analyzing the received beam pattern and deriving closed-form expressions for its width and central beam gain as a function of user location. Building on these derived expressions, we propose a beam training method that estimates user distance from the received signal powers using DFT beams, with a computational complexity of O(1). Simulation results confirm the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its ability to perform low-complexity near-field beam training with high estimation accuracy. Notably, our proposed scheme achieves up to a 1.96 dB SNR gain over exhaustive search methods in multi-user beamforming scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>

      <title>Electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of liver diseases: an externally validated and explainable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Liver diseases present a significant global health challenge and often require costly, invasive diagnostics. Electrocardiography (ECG), a widely available and non-invasive tool, can enable the detection of liver disease by capturing cardiovascular-hepatic interactions.
  Methods: We trained tree-based machine learning models on ECG features to detect liver diseases using two large datasets: MIMIC-IV-ECG (467,729 patients, 2008-2019) and ECG-View II (775,535 patients, 1994-2013). The task was framed as binary classification, with performance evaluated via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To improve interpretability, we applied explainability methods to identify key predictive features.
  Findings: The models showed strong predictive performance with good generalizability. For example, AUROCs for alcoholic liver disease (K70) were 0.8025 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8020-0.8035) internally and 0.7644 (95% CI, 0.7641-0.7649) externally; for hepatic failure (K72), scores were 0.7404 (95% CI, 0.7389-0.7415) and 0.7498 (95% CI, 0.7494-0.7509), respectively. The explainability analysis consistently identified age and prolonged QTc intervals (corrected QT, reflecting ventricular repolarization) as key predictors. Features linked to autonomic regulation and electrical conduction abnormalities were also prominent, supporting known cardiovascular-liver connections and suggesting QTc as a potential biomarker.
  Interpretation: ECG-based machine learning offers a promising, interpretable approach for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited settings. By revealing clinically relevant biomarkers, this method supports non-invasive diagnostics, early detection, and risk stratification prior to targeted clinical assessments.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theoretic and Algorithmic Framework for Solving Multivariate Linear Model with $\ell^1$-norm Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem that solving the \textit{multivariate linear model} (MLM) $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with the $\ell_1 $-norm approximation method such that $||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||_1$, the $\ell_1$-norm of the \textit{residual error vector} (REV), is minimized. In this work, our contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, the equivalence theorem for the structure of the $\ell_1$-norm optimal solution to the MLM is proposed and proved; secondly, a unified algorithmic framework for solving the MLM with $\ell_1$-norm optimization is proposed and six novel algorithms (L1-GPRS, L1-TNIPM, L1-HP, L1-IST, L1-ADM, L1-POB) are designed. There are three significant characteristics in the algorithms discussed: they are implemented with simple matrix operations which do not depend on specific optimization solvers; they are described with algorithmic pseudo-codes and implemented with Python and Octave/MATLAB which means easy usage; and the high accuracy and efficiency of our six new algorithms can be achieved successfully in the scenarios with different levels of data redundancy. We hope that the unified theoretic and algorithmic framework with source code released on GitHub could motivate the applications of the $\ell_1$-norm optimization for parameter estimation of MLM arising in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, economics, and so on.</description>

      <title>On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roaming in Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</description>

      <title>Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage and thus enables more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples on widely used open datasets. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance explainability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise. Our code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}{\texttt{github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}}.</description>

      <title>MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.</description>
