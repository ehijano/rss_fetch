      <title>Self-organized dynamics of a viscous drop with interfacial nematic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study emergent dynamics in a viscous drop subject to interfacial nematic activity. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show how the interplay of nematodynamics, activity-driven flows and surface deformations gives rise to a sequence of self-organized behaviors of increasing complexity, from periodic braiding motions of topological defects to chaotic defect dynamics and active turbulence, along with spontaneous shape changes and translation. Our findings recapitulate qualitative features of experiments and shed light on the mechanisms underpinning morphological dynamics in active interfaces.</description>

      <title>2D capsid formation within an oscillatory energy landscape: orderly self-assembly depends on the interplay between a dynamic potential and intrinsic relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple dissipative self-assembly protocols designed to create novel structures or to reduce kinetic traps have recently emerged. Specifically, temporal oscillations of particle interactions have been shown effective at both aims, but investigations thus far have focused on systems of simple colloids or their binary mixtures. In this work, we expand our understanding of the effect of temporally oscillating interactions to a two-dimensional coarse-grained viral capsid-like model that undergoes a self-limited assembly. This model includes multiple intrinsic relaxation times due to the internal structure of the capsid subunits and, under certain interaction regimes, proceeds via a two-step nucleation mechanism. We find that oscillations much faster than the local intrinsic relaxation times can be described via a time averaged inter-particle potential across a wide range of interaction strengths, while oscillations much slower than these relaxation times result in structures that adapt to the attraction strength of the current half-cycle. Interestingly, oscillations periods similar to these relaxation times shift the interaction window over which orderly assembly occurs by enabling error correction during the half-cycles with weaker attractions. Our results provide fundamental insights to non-equilibrium self-assembly on temporally variant energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Inducing mechanical self-healing in glassy polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy polymer melts such as the plastics used in pipes, structural materials, and medical devices are ubiquitous in daily life. They accumulate damage over time due to their use, which limits their functionalities and demands periodic replacement. The resulting economic and social burden could be mitigated by the design of self-healing mechanisms that expand the lifespan of materials. However, the characteristic low molecular mobility in glassy polymer melts intrinsically limits the design of self-healing behavior. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that controlled oscillatory deformations enhance the local molecular mobility of glassy polymers without compromising their structural or mechanical stability. We apply this principle to increase the molecular mobility around the surface of a crack, inducing fracture repair and recovering the mechanical properties of the pristine material. Our findings establish a general physical mechanism of self-healing in glasses that may inspire the design and processing of new glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Alignment-induced depression and shear thinning of anisotropic granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When granular materials of shape-anisotropic grains are sheared in a split-bottom shear cell, a localized shear band is formed with a depression at its center. This effect is closely related to the alignment of the particles with aspect ratio (AR), which, in turn, influences the local packing density, the stress distribution, and the system's overall bulk rheology. Particles with large AR tend to align with the shear direction, which increases the packing density in the shear band and affects rheological properties like stress, macroscopic friction coefficient, and effective viscosity. A scaling law correlates particle AR to macroscopic friction and effective viscosity, revealing shear-thinning behavior in bulk and near the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology and surface characteristics of lyophilisates significantly impact the stability and reconstitutability of freeze-dried pharmaceuticals. Consequently, visual quality control of the product is imperative. However, this procedure is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also expensive and prone to errors. In this paper, we present an approach for fully automated, non-destructive inspection of freeze-dried pharmaceuticals, leveraging robotics, computed tomography, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-reciprocal interactions on colloidal self-assembly with tunable anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal (NR) effective interactions violating Newton's third law occur in many biological systems, but can also be engineered in synthetic, colloidal systems. Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation, but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale. Here we focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is tunable by external fields. In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life times [Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic trapping. Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic, but NR anisotropic interactions. We find that NR induces an effective propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium. The shape and stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of anisotropy. At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the same time in the passive case. In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the aggregation. Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly anisotropic. In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain essentially disordered. Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the system to overcome kinetic barriers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and effective shear modulus in a semi-solid membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of physical properties, the cell membrane is an exotic two-dimensional material that has a dual nature: it exhibits characteristics of fluids, i.e., lipid molecules show lateral diffusion, while also demonstrating properties of solids, evidenced by a non-zero shear modulus. We construct a model for such a $\textit{semi-solid}$ $\textit{membrane}$. Our model is a fluctuating randomly triangulated mesh with two different kinds of nodes. The solid nodes never change their neighbors, while the fluid nodes do. As the area fraction occupied by the solid nodes ($\Phi$) is increased the motion of fluid nodes transition from diffusion to localization via subdiffusion. Next, the solid nodes are pinned to mimic the pinning of the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. For the pinned membrane, there exists a range of $\Phi$ over which the model has both a non-zero shear modulus and a non-zero lateral diffusivity. The bending modulus, measured through the spectrum of height fluctuations remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Traveling strings of active dipolar colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an intriguing new type of self-assembled active colloidal polymer system in 3D. It is obtained from a suspension of Janus particles in an electric field that induces parallel dipoles in the particles as well as self-propulsion in the plane perpendicular to the field. At low packing fractions, in experiment, the particles self-assemble into 3D columns that are self-propelled in 2D. Explicit numerical simulations combining dipolar interactions and active self-propulsion find an activity dependent transition to a string phase by increasing dipole strength. We classify the collective dynamics of strings as a function of rotational and translational diffusion. Using an anisotropic version of the Rouse model of polymers with active driving, we analytically compute the strings' collective dynamics and centre of mass motion, which matches simulations and is consistent with experimental data. We also discover long range correlations of the fluctuations along the string contour that grow with the active persistence time, a purely active effect that disappears in the thermal limit.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anti-Ferroelectric Ordering and the Coupling of Liquid Crystalline and Polar Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar liquid crystals possess three dimensional orientational order coupled with unidirectional electric polarity, yielding fluid ferroelectrics. Such polar phases are generated by rod-like molecules with large electric dipole moments. 2,5-Disubstituted 1,3-dioxane is commonly employed as a polar motif in said systems, and here we show this to suffer from thermal instability as a consequence of equatorial-trans to axial-trans isomerism at elevated temperatures. We utilise isosteric building blocks as potential replacements for the 1,3- dioxane unit, and in doing so we obtain new examples of fluid ferroelectric systems. For binary mixtures of certain composition, we observe the emergence of a new fluid antiferroelectric phase - a finding not observed for either of the parent molecules. Our study also reveals a critical tipping point for the emergence of polar order in otherwise apolar systems. These results hint at the possibility for uncovering new highly ordered polar LC phases and delineate distinct transition mechanisms in orientational and polar ordering.</description>

      <title>TMM$-$Sim: A Versatile Tool for Optical Simulation of Thin$-$Film Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) has become a prominent tool for the optical simulation of thin$-$film solar cells, particularly among researchers specializing in organic semiconductors and perovskite materials. As the commercial viability of these solar cells continues to advance, driven by rapid developments in materials and production processes, the importance of optical simulation has grown significantly. By leveraging optical simulation, researchers can gain profound insights into photovoltaic phenomena, empowering the implementation of device optimization strategies to achieve enhanced performance. However, existing TMM$-$based packages exhibit limitations, such as requiring programming expertise, licensing fees, or lack of support for bilayer device simulation. In response to these gaps and challenges, we present the TMM Simulator (TMM$-$Sim), an intuitive and user$-$friendly tool to calculate essential photovoltaic parameters, including the optical electric field profile, exciton generation profile, fraction of light absorbed per layer, photocurrent, external quantum efficiency, internal quantum efficiency, and parasitic losses. An additional advantage of TMM$-$Sim lies in its capacity to generate outcomes suitable as input parameters for electro$-$optical device simulations. In this work, we offer a comprehensive guide, outlining a step$-$by$-$step process to use TMM$-$Sim, and provide a thorough analysis of the results. TMM$-$Sim is freely available, accessible through our web server (nanocalc.org), or downloadable from the TMM$-$Sim repository (for \textit{Unix}, \textit{Windows}, and \textit{macOS}) on \textit{GitHub}. With its user$-$friendly interface and powerful capabilities, TMM$-$Sim aims to facilitate and accelerate research in thin$-$film solar cells, fostering advancements in renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Can exact scaling exponents be obtained using the renormalization group? Affirmative evidence from incompressible polar active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In active matter systems, non-Gaussian, exact scaling exponents have been claimed in a range of systems using perturbative renormalization group (RG) methods. This is unusual compared to equilibrium systems where non-Gaussian exponents can typically only be approximated, even using the exact (or functional/nonperturbative) renormalization group (ERG). Here, we perform an ERG analysis on the ordered phase of incompressible polar active fluids and find that the exact non-Gaussian exponents obtained previously using a perturbative RG method remain valid even in this nonperturbative setting. Furthermore, our ERG analysis elucidates the RG flow of this system and enables us to identify an active Goldstone regime with nontrivial, long-ranged scaling behavior for parallel and longitudinal fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies on the generalized XY model have concentrated on the equilibrium phase diagram and the equilibrium nature of distinct phases under varying parameter conditions. We direct our attention towards examining the systems evolution towards equilibrium states across different parameter values, specifically by varying the relative strengths of ferromagnetic and nematic interactions. We study the kinetics of the system, using the temporal annihilation of defects at varying temperatures and its impact on the coarsening behavior of the system. For both pure polar and pure nematic systems, we observe temperature-dependent decay of the exponent, leading to a decelerated growth of domains within the system. At parameter values where both ferromagnetic and nematic interactions are simultaneously present, we show a phase diagram highlighting three low-temperature phases : polar, nematic, and coexistence, alongside a high-temperature disordered phase. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of interactions, offering a comprehensive understanding of the systems behavior during its evolution towards equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Water molecules confined between biological membranes exhibit a distinctive non-Gaussian displacement distribution, far different from bulk water. Here, we introduce a new transport equation for water molecules in the intermembrane space, quantitatively explaining molecular dynamics simulation results. We find the unique transport dynamics of water molecules stems from the lateral diffusion coefficient fluctuation caused by their longitudinal motion. We also identify an interfacial region where water possesses distinct physical properties, unaffected by changes in the intermembrane separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two active Brownian particles collide, they slide along each other until they can continue their free motion. For persistence lengths much larger than the particle diameter, the directors do not change, but the collision can be modeled as producing a net displacement on the particles compared to their free motion in the absence of the encounter. With these elements, a Boltzmann--Enskog-like kinetic theory is built. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous state predicts a density instability resulting from the effective velocity reduction of tagged particles predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Global self$-$similarity of dense granular flow in hopper: the role of hopper width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of hopper width on dense granular flow in a two$-$dimensional hopper is investigated through experiments and simulations. Though the flow rate remains stable for larger hopper widths, a slight reduction in hopper width results in a significant increase in flow rate for smaller hopper widths. Both Beverloo\('\)s and Janda\('\)s formula accurately capture the relationship between the flow rate and outlet size. Flow characteristics in the regions near the outlet exhibit local self$-$similarity, supporting Beverloo and Janda's principles. Moreover, global self$-$similarity is analysed, indicated by the transition in flow state from mass flow in regions far from the outlet to funnel flow near the outlet. The earlier occurrence of this transition favors to enhance the grain velocity and consequently increases the dense flow rate. An exponential scaling law is proposed to describe the dependencies of flow rate, grain velocity, and transition height between the mass flow pattern and the funnel flow pattern on silo width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient implementation of the numerical tensor-train (TT) based algorithm solving the multicomponent coagulation equation preserving the nonnegativeness of solution. Unnatural negative elements in the constructed approximation arise due to the errors of the low-rank decomposition and discretization scheme. In this work, we propose to apply the rank-one corrections in the TT-format proportional to the minimal negative element. Such an element can be found via application of the global optimization methods that can be fully implemented within efficient operations in the tensor train format. We incorporate this trick into the time-integration scheme for the multicomponent coagulation equation and also use it for post-processing of the stationary solution for the problem with the source of particles.</description>
