      <title>Robust Contracting for Sequential Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal contracts with an agent who can sequentially search over projects to generate a prize. The principal knows only one of the agent's available projects and evaluates a contract by its worst-case performance. We characterize the set of robustly optimal contracts, all of which involve a minimum debt level, i.e., the agent only receives payment if the prize exceeds a certain threshold. This debt requirement is essential to prevent the agent from terminating the search too early. Our characterization encompasses several commonly observed contract formats, including pure debt, debt-plus-equity, and tranches. We also study situations where each of these contracts emerges as the unique prediction. In contrast to much of the existing robust contracting literature, linear contracts are strictly sub-optimal because they dampen the agent's search incentive.</description>

      <title>Non-distributive Lattices, Stable Matchings, and Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that all finite lattices, including non-distributive lattices, arise as stable matching lattices under standard assumptions on choice functions. In the process, we introduce new tools to reason on general lattices for optimization purposes: the partial representation of a lattice, which partially extends Birkhoff's representation theorem to non-distributive lattices; the distributive closure of a lattice, which gives such a partial representation; and join constraints, which can be added to the distributive closure to obtain a representation for the original lattice. Then, we use these techniques to show that the minimum cost stable matching problem under the same standard assumptions on choice functions is NP-hard, by establishing a connection with antimatroid theory.</description>

      <title>Function-coherent gambles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces function-coherent gambles, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>
