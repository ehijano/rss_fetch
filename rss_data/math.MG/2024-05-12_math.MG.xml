      <title>Naive Property A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the natural question of when the generalised F{\o}lner sets exhibiting property A can be chosen to be subsets of the space itself. We show that for many property A spaces $X$, this is indeed possible: specifically this holds when $X$ is a discrete bounded geometry metric space which coarsely has all components unbounded, when $X$ is any countable discrete group, and for all box spaces.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate two kinds of applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). Next we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by the Spidron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that the Spidron has a $1$-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of the Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of the Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing $1$-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that these systems can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>
