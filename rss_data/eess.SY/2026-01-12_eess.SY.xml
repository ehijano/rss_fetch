      <title>Data-Based Analysis of Relative Degree and Zero Dynamics in Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control offers a powerful alternative to traditional model-based methods, particularly when accurate system models are unavailable or prohibitively complex. While existing data-driven control methods primarily aim to construct controllers directly from measured data, our approach uses the available data to assess fundamental system-theoretic properties. This allows the informed selection of suitable control strategies without explicit model identification. We provide data-based conditions characterizing the (vector) relative degree and the stability of the zero dynamics, which are critical for ensuring proper performance of modern controllers. Our results cover both single- and multi-input/output settings of discrete-time linear systems. We further show how a continuous-time system can be reconstructed from three sampling discretizations obtained via Zero-order Hold at suitable sampling times, thus allowing the extension of the results to the combined data collected from these discretizations. All results can be applied directly to observed data sets using the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Decentralized Electromagnetic Formation Flying Control Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flying (EMFF) is challenging due to the complex coupling between the electromagnetic fields generated by each satellite in the formation. To address this challenge, this article uses alternating magnetic field forces (AMFF) to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled to achieve desired forces between each pair of satellites. The main contribution of this article is a 3-satellite experimental demonstration of decentralized closed-loop EMFF using AMFF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of AMFF with at least 3 satellites in open or closed loop. This is noteworthy because the coupling challenges of EMFF are only present with more than 2 satellites, and thus, a formation of at least 3 is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of AMFF. The experiments are conducted on a ground-based testbed consisting of 3 electromagnetically actuated satellites on linear air tracks. The closed-loop experimental results are compared with behavior from numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.</description>

      <title>SIaD-Tool: A Comprehensive Frequency-Domain Tool for Small-Signal Stability and Interaction Assessment in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.</description>

      <title>Discrete Homogeneity and Quantizer Design for Nonlinear Homogeneous Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for analysis of generalized homogeneous control systems under state quantization. In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>LLM-DMD: Large Language Model-based Power System Dynamic Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.</description>

      <title>Explicit Reward Mechanisms for Local Flexibility in Renewable Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Bifurcation Analysis of Longitudinal Dynamics of an Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear model of an Air-Breathing Hypersonic Vehicle (ABHV) longitudinal dynamics characterized by coupling of aerodynamic and propulsive terms is presented in this paper. The model is verified using modal analysis carried out around a design operating condition with results available in the literature. Further, parametric dynamic behavior is computed for the model as steady states with local stability with respect to its control inputs, elevator and fuel-equivalence ratio in four different cases using a numerical continuation algorithm. Detailed analysis of the qualitative longitudinal dynamics of the model is carried out based on bifurcation theory methodology. Numerical simulation results are presented to verify bifurcation analysis results.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Clustering of Low-Inertia Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.</description>

      <title>Resilient UAV Data Mule via Adaptive Sensor Association under Timing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be critical for time-sensitive data collection missions, yet existing research often relies on simulations that fail to capture real-world complexities. Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download. This work demonstrates the importance of integrating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware and buffer-aware scheduling with DT and RW signal traces to design resilient UAV data-mule strategies for realistic deployments.</description>

      <title>GenCtrl -- A Formal Controllability Toolkit for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.</description>

      <title>Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis under Dynamic Charging Profile Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) are two effective approaches for battery degradation monitoring. One limiting factor for their real-world application is that they require constant-current (CC) charging profiles. This research removes this limitation and proposes an approach that extends ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring from CC charging to dynamic charging profiles. A novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (VIC) and virtual differential voltage (VDV) is proposed. Then, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct VIC/VDV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from dynamic charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) range that satisfies some constraints. Finally, two CNNs called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net are proposed as replacements for the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, to reduce the computational footprint and memory requirements, while keeping similar performance. Using an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules, the proposed CNNs are demonstrated to provide accurate VIC/VDV curves and enable ICA/DVA-based battery degradation monitoring under various fast-charging protocols and different SOC ranges.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal-by-construction augmentation of physics-based input-output models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel orthogonal-by-construction parametrization for augmenting physics-based input-output models with a learning component in an additive sense. The parametrization allows to jointly optimize the parameters of the physics-based model and the learning component. Unlike the commonly applied additive (parallel) augmentation structure, the proposed formulation eliminates overlap in representation of the system dynamics, thereby preserving the uniqueness of the estimated physical parameters, ultimately leading to enhanced model interpretability. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the method is statistically consistent and guarantees recovery of the true physical parameters. With further analysis regarding the asymptotic covariance matrix of the identified parameters, we also prove that the proposed structure provides a clear separation between the physics-based and learning components of the augmentation structure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies, showing accurate reproduction of the data-generating dynamics without sacrificing consistent estimation of the physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Model-free Adaptive Output Feedback Vibration Suppression in a Cantilever Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>Pivot-Only Azimuthal Control and Attitude Estimation of Balloon-borne Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Stochastic Distributed Learning</title>

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems, both nonconvex and convex, over undirected networks. In particular, we design a novel algorithm based on the distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address the challenges of high communication costs, and large datasets. Our design tackles these challenges i) by enabling the agents to perform multiple local training steps between each round of communications; and ii) by allowing the agents to employ stochastic gradients while carrying out local computations. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point, for nonconvex problems, and of an optimal point, for convex problems. We also propose a variant of the algorithm to incorporate variance reduction thus achieving exact convergence. We show that the resulting algorithm indeed converges to a stationary (or optimal) point, and moreover that local training accelerates convergence. We thoroughly compare the proposed algorithms with the state of the art, both theoretically and through numerical results.</description>

      <title>The factorization of matrices into products of positive definite factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive-definite matrices materialize as state transition matrices of linear time-invariant gradient flows, and the composition of such materializes as the state transition after successive steps where the driving potential is suitably adjusted. Thus, factoring an arbitrary matrix (with positive determinant) into a product of positive-definite ones provides the needed schedule for a time-varying potential to have a desired effect. The present work provides a detailed analysis of this factorization problem by lifting it into a sequence of Monge-Kantorovich transportation steps on Gaussian distributions and studying the induced holonomy of the optimal transportation problem. From this vantage point we determine the minimal number of positive-definite factors that have a desired effect on the spectrum of the product, e.g., ensure specified eigenvalues or being a rotation matrix. Our approach is computational and allows to identify the needed number of factors as well as trade off their conditioning number with their actual number.</description>

      <title>Selection-Induced Contraction of Innovation Statistics in Gated Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical GNN-Based Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane and Emergency Vehicle Corridor Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergency vehicles require rapid passage through congested traffic, yet existing strategies fail to adapt to dynamic conditions. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.</description>
