      <title>On the Equivalence of Demagnetization Tensors as Discrete Cell Size Approaches Zero in Three-Dimensional Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the demagnetization field is crucial in various disciplines, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micromagnetics. A standard method involves discretizing the spatial domain into finite difference cells and using demagnetization tensors to compute the field. Different demagnetization tensors can result in contributions from adjacent cells that do not approach zero, nor do their differences, even as the cell size decreases. This work demonstrates that in three-dimensional space, a specific set of magnetization tensors produces the same total demagnetization field as the Cauchy principal value when the cell size approaches zero. Additionally, we provide a lower bound for the convergence speed, validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>New design paradigm for highly efficient and low noise photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high quantum efficiency (QE) with low dark count is essential for highly sensitive photodetectors (PDs), including single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs). However, high QE requires a thicker absorber region, which leads to high dark current and noise, which in turn affects the detectivity of PDs and the photodetection efficiency and dark count of SPADs.The holy grail of photodetector and avalanche photodiode designs is to achieve highest QE with thinnest absorber and still enable large avalanche to gain as needed. We have developed a new design paradigm which exploits the coupling between dielectric Mie resonance and transverse propagating waves in thin layers. The Mie resonance launches the incident light at an angle in an ultrathin absorber, and when coupled to transverse waves, the light propagates laterally and is fully absorbed owing to the longer optical path. Consequently, with appropriate choice of materials for a chosen wavelength, a high absorption(~90%) within typically &lt;100 nm absorber thickness is possible. For illustration, we apply our approach to design Si-based detector operating at 810 nm and InGaAs-based detector operating at 1550 nm and predict that the dark current at room temperature is reduced at least by two orders of magnitude. In addition, the lateral distances are often in a few microns and hence these designs can potentially enable avalanching for a large optical gain.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry Bounds in Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general treatment for the temporal coupled-mode theory with arbitrary numbers of modes and ports, and derive tight bounds for the coupling phases in addition to coupling strengths under time-reversal symmetry. We report trade-offs between the cardinalities of the reciprocal regions of the resonant coupling strengths versus phases. We discover that time-reversal symmetry enforces projected generalized reflections in the background to cancel out completely. In double-port systems, the reciprocal regions of the coupling phases span a quarter of the nonreciprocal regions for any non-hidden mode.</description>

      <title>Record-High Electron Mobility and Controlled Low 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ Si-doping in (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Epitaxial Drift Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of controllably Si-doped 4.5 $\mu$m thick $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with electron concentrations in the 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ range and record-high room temperature Hall electron mobilities of up to 200 cm$^2$/V.s, reaching the predicted theoretical maximum room temperature mobility value for $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Growth of the homoepitaxial films was performed on Fe-doped (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates at a growth rate of 1.9 $\mu$m/hr using TEGa as the Gallium precursor. To probe the background electron concentration, an unintentionally doped film was grown with a Hall concentration of 3.43 x 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and Hall mobility of 196 cm$^2$/V.s. Growth of intentionally Si-Doped films was accomplished by fixing all growth conditions and varying only the silane flow, with controllable Hall electron concentrations ranging from 4.38 x 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ to 8.30 x 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and exceptional Hall mobilities ranging from 194 - 200 cm$^2$/V.s demonstrated. C-V measurements showed a flat charge profile with the N$_D^+$ - N$_A^-$ values correlating well with the Hall-measured electron concentration in the films. SIMS measurements showed the silicon atomic concentration matched the Hall electron concentration with Carbon and Hydrogen below detection limit in the films. The Hall, C-V, and SIMS data indicate the growth of high-quality 4.5 $\mu$m thick $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and controllable doping into the mid 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ range. These results demonstrate MOCVD growth of electronics grade record-high mobility, low carrier density, and thick $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ drift layers for next generation vertical $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power devices.</description>

      <title>Monolithic beta-Ga2O3 Bidirectional MOSFET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a monolithic bidirectional dual-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) fabricated on epitaxially grown beta-Ga2O3, demonstrating efficient two-way conduction and blocking. It features two independently controlled gates and operates in four distinct modes, offering flexibility in managing current and voltage in the first and third quadrants. This versatility makes it ideal for various power conversion system applications. The device operates at a low negative threshold voltage (~-2.4 V for both gates) with a zero turn-on drain voltage and an on-resistance of approximately 500 ohm.mm. It exhibits a high on/off current ratio of 10^7 in all three conducting modes. In the blocking mode, the device breakdown was measured to be more than +-350 V with a current compliance of 0.5 mA/mm. The estimated breakdown field and power figure of merit for the device are 0.35 MV/cm and 1.6 MW/cm2 respectively.</description>

      <title>Si/AlN p-n heterojunction interfaced with ultrathin SiO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials hold immense potential for high-power RF electronics and deep ultraviolet photonics. Among these, AlGaN emerges as a promising candidate, offering a tunable bandgap from 3.4 eV (GaN) to 6.2 eV (AlN) and remarkable material characteristics. However, achieving efficient p-type doping in high aluminum composition AlGaN remains a formidable challenge. This study presents an alternative approach to address this issue by fabricating a p+Si/n-AlN/n+AlGaN heterojunction structure by following the semiconductor grafting technique. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) confirmed the high crystalline quality of the AlN/AlGaN layers, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.16 degrees for the AlGaN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the AlN surface exhibited a smooth topography with a roughness of 1.9 nm. Furthermore, the transferred Si surface demonstrated an even finer smoothness, with a roughness of 0.545 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements demonstrated a type-I heterojunction with a valence band offset of 3.63 eV and a conduction band offset of 1.32 eV. The pn diode devices exhibited a linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, an ideality factor of 1.92, and a rectification ratio of 3.3e4, with a turn-on voltage of 3.9 V, indicating effective p-n heterojunction. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements showed stable operation up to 90C. The heterojunction's high-quality interface and electrical performance showcase its potential for advanced AlGaN-based optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Real time detection of C reactive protein in interstitial fluid using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, towards wearable health monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional detection methods of C-reactive protein (CRP) inflammation biomarker, in blood are expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. Such existing point-of-care CRP detection devices remain invasive, since they need blood sampling (finger-pricking or venous puncture). Here, we propose an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based sensor for the real-time, fast, specific, sensitive, and label-free detection of C-reactive protein in the interstitial fluid (ISF) that can be accessed with minimally invasive microneedle arrays. The sensor has the potential to be integrated in a wearable device similar with the continuous glucose monitoring, that will detect CRP in interstitial fluid in a non-invasive, inexpensive and straightforward manner. The affinity based assay was tested in both buffer and ISF-like solution. The limit of detection achieved was 0.7 ug/mL of CRP in buffer, and 0.8 ug/mL of CRP in ISF-like solution and the sensor shows excellent linearity up to 10 ug/mL. It is worth noting that the proposed sensor operates in low sample volume (down to 5 uL), and has a response time of 100 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, advancements in attosecond spectroscopy have allowed us to study electron motion dynamics in condensed matter. The access to these electron dynamics and, consequently, its control by an ultrafast light field paves the way for establishing ultrafast optoelectronics. Here, we report the generation of light-induced quantum tunnelling current in graphene phototransistors by ultrafast laser pulses in an ambient environment. This tunnelling effect provides access to the instantaneous field-driven current to demonstrate the current switching (ON and OFF) on a 630 attosecond (1.6 petahertz speed). Moreover, we controlled the tunnelling current and enhanced the graphene phototransistor conductivity by controlling the density of the photoexcited charge carriers at different pump laser powers. Furthermore, we exploited this capability to demonstrate various logic gates. The demonstrated light-induced tunnelling current and ultrafast switching were attained under standard room temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, the presented scientific advancement in this work is at the technology readiness level suitable for its immediate integration into the development of ultrafast, nearly six orders of magnitude faster, optical transistors, lightwave electronics, and optical quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Re-routing game: The inadequacy of mean-field approach in modeling the herd behavior in path switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination of vehicle routes is a feasible way to ease traffic congestions amid a fixed road infrastructure. Nevertheless, even the optimal route configurations are provided to individual drivers, it is hard to achieve as greedy drivers may switch to other routes for a lower individual cost. Recent research uses mean-field cavity approach from the studies of spin glasses to analyze the impact of path switching in optimized transportation networks. However, this method only provides a mean-field approximation, which does not take into account the collective herd behavior in path switching due to un-coordinated individual decisions. In this study, we propose an exhaustive cavity approach to investigate the impact of un-coordinated path switching in a re-routing game and reveal that greedy drivers' decision can be highly correlated which leads to the failure of mean-fielded approaches. Our theoretical results fits well with simulations, and our developed framework can be generalized to analyze other games with multiple players and rounds. Our results shed light on the impact of herd behavior of un-coordinated human drivers in suppressing congestions through path coordination.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analytical Design Procedure for Distributed Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple while comprehensive analytical design procedure for distributed amplifiers. Distributed amplifiers are attractive for designers due to their wideband capability. When designing a distributed amplifier, the first question that comes to mind is how wide the bandwidth can be. This paper answers this question by using the self-matching and low-pass properties of a distributed amplifier. Self-matching property of a distributed power amplifier is an interesting point that distinguishes it from other types of power amplifiers that are usually based on input and output matching networks. Here the estimation of the bandwidth of a distributed amplifier structure is discussed. The equations that are used in this paper can bring good insight and they can assist designers. Furthermore, we have explained the frequency behavior of a tapered distributed amplifier analytically for the first time. In order to validate the approach presented here, we have used published designs including our previously published design as practical examples. The flowchart of the design procedure is also provided.</description>

Abstract: We report on the effects of cosmic ray interactions with the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) based focal plane array for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe the peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic bands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\sim\,$900-pixel, KID-based array chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a 0.5$\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused by this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions of 788 (99.6$\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme. Using this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of 2.1$\,\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\,$% of the events affect a single pixel, and another 33$\,$% affect $&lt;\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a 0.66$\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total cosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible in-flight dead fraction is $\sim\,$0.165$\,$%, which demonstrates our design will be robust against these high-energy events.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>

Abstract: The Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) is designed to probe the star formation history in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies around the peak of cosmic star formation. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\sim 250$ long-slit grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor). This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| &lt; 3 uT.</description>

Each of the 2 arrays consists of 4 wafer-sized dies (quadrants), and the overall assembly must satisfy thermal and mechanical requirements, while maintaining high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. In particular, our design manages to strictly maintain a 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ air gap between the array and the horn block. We have prototyped and are now testing a sub-scale assembly which houses a single quadrant for characterization before integration into the full array. The initial test result shows a $&gt;$95% yield, indicating a good performance of our TIM detector packaging design.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam deflection is a popular method to measure the deformation of micromechanical devices. As it measures mostly a local slope, its sensitivity depends on the location and size of the optical spot. We present a method to evaluate precisely these parameters, using the relative amplitude of the thermal noise induced vibrations. With a case study of a microcantilever, we demonstrate the accuracy of the approach, as well as its ability to fully characterize the sensitivity of the detector and the parameters (mass, stiffness) of the resonator.</description>
