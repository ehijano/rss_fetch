      <title>Emergent oscillations and chaos in non-compliant microfluidic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressible fluids in microfluidic networks with non-rigid channels can exhibit flow rate oscillations analogous to electric current oscillations in RLC circuits. This is due to the elastic deformation of channel walls that can store and release fluid, as electric capacitors can store and release electric charges. This property is quantified through the compliance of the system, defined as the volume change relative to the pressure change. In systems with rigid walls and incompressible fluid, compliance vanishes and no oscillations can occur through this mechanism. Here, we show that not only oscillations but also chaos can emerge in the flow-rate dynamics of non-compliant microfluidic networks with incompressible fluid. Notably, these dynamics emerge spontaneously, even under time-independent driving pressures. The underlying mechanism is governed by the effect of fluid inertia, which becomes relevant at moderate Reynolds numbers observed in microfluidic systems exhibiting complex flow patterns. The results are established using a combination of direct numerical simulations and a reduced model derived from modal analysis. This approach enables us to determine the onset of oscillations, the associated bifurcations, the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, and their dependence on the driving pressures. These findings can inspire novel studies and applications of previously unexplored oscillatory and chaotic regimes in non-compliant microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>A sensor-restrained artificial shear diffusivity for large-eddy simulations of vortex-dominated compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sensor-restrained model for the shear viscosity term within the localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) scheme to stabilize compressible large-eddy simulations with low-pressure-core vortical structures. LAD methods are used in numerical solvers based on spectral-like compact finite-difference schemes. While high-order-accurate numerical schemes with proper discretization guarantees physical fidelity, the LAD role is to suppress non-physical oscillations arising in compressible flow simulations near shock waves and other sharp gradients. LAD is a cost-effective approach which adds artificial shear and bulk viscosities, and thermal conductivity to their physical counterparts. However, an unrestricted added diffusivity may lead to poorly-resolved coherent structures and undesirable turbulence statistics. In order to prevent excessive numerical diffusion in compressible shear flows, the artificial shear viscosity term can be disabled in cases where the simulation is already stable. However, in flow simulations where vortices emerge within a low-pressure region, a strong pressure decay may lead to instabilities that make the simulation unstable. For such cases, adding artificial shear viscosity is necessary to maintain numerical stability, as this issue is unaddressed by the artificial bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity alone. Our approach integrates a sensor into the standard LAD formulation, particularly in the artificial shear viscosity, that reduces the added diffusivity while preserving numerical stability. This advancement is possible by adding the shear diffusivity only in localized flow regions consisting of low-pressure-core vortices, and it enables stable and accurate large-eddy simulations (LES) of compressible vortex-dominated flows, such as those encountered in separated flows and bluff-body wakes.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations of Perforated Elastic Vortex Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a high-fidelity two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction simulations, focusing on a novel perforated elastic vortex generator that is wall-mounted in an open channel with an incoming flow. The response of a perforated elastic vortex generator is investigated across a wide range of dimensionless parameters including dimensionless rigidity, mass ratios, Reynolds numbers, and porosity levels. Additional simulations for non-perforated elastic vortex generator are conducted for comparison and validation against available data. The findings demonstrate that a perforated elastic vortex generator can exhibit static configurations, lodging configurations, and vortex-induced vibration modes, depending on the dimensionless parameters. These configurations are similar to those observed for non-perforated elastic vortex generators, though the response values differ due to changes in the mechanical properties of the elastic vortex generator and the fluid loads acting on it as a result of perforation. An analysis of the perforated elastic vortex generator's natural frequencies shows that vortex-induced vibrations are triggered by the lock-in phenomenon associated with the second natural frequency of the vortex generator. Additionally, local flow dynamics are also studied by investigating vortical structures and velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Compressing fluid flows with nonlinear machine learning: mode decomposition, latent modeling, and flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An autoencoder is a self-supervised machine-learning network trained to output a quantity identical to the input. Owing to its structure possessing a bottleneck with a lower dimension, an autoencoder works to achieve data compression, extracting the essence of the high-dimensional data into the resulting latent space. We review the fundamentals of flow field compression using convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and its applications to various fluid dynamics problems. We cover the structure and the working principle of CNN-AE with an example of unsteady flows while examining the theoretical similarities between linear and nonlinear compression techniques. Representative applications of CNN-AE to various flow problems, such as mode decomposition, latent modeling, and flow control, are discussed. Throughout the present review, we show how the outcomes from the nonlinear machine-learning-based compression may support modeling and understanding a range of fluid mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a physically interpretable data-driven wind-turbine wake model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a compact data-driven Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model for wind turbine wake prediction, built as an enhancement of the standard $k$-$\varepsilon$ formulation. Several candidate models were discovered using the symbolic regression framework Sparse Regression of Turbulent Stress Anisotropy (SpaRTA), trained on a single Large Eddy Simulation (LES) dataset of a standalone wind turbine. The leading model was selected by prioritizing simplicity while maintaining reasonable accuracy, resulting in a novel linear eddy viscosity model. This selected leading model reduces eddy viscosity in high-shear regions$\unicode{x2014}$particularly in the wake$\unicode{x2014}$to limit turbulence mixing and delay wake recovery. This addresses a common shortcoming of the standard $k$-$\varepsilon$ model, which tends to overpredict mixing, leading to unrealistically fast wake recovery. Moreover, the formulation of the leading model closely resembles that of the established $k$-$\varepsilon$-$f_P$ model. Consistent with this resemblance, the leading and $k$-$\varepsilon$-$f_P$ models show nearly identical performance in predicting velocity fields and power output, but they differ in their predictions of turbulent kinetic energy. In addition, the generalization capability of the leading model was assessed using three unseen six-turbine configurations with varying spacing and alignment. Despite being trained solely on a standalone turbine case, the model produced results comparable to LES data. These findings demonstrate that data-driven methods can yield interpretable, physically consistent RANS models that are competitive with traditional modeling approaches while maintaining simplicity and achieving generalizability.</description>

      <title>A continuum thermodynamic model of the influence of non-ionic surfactant on mass transfer from gas bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer of gaseous components from rising bubbles to the ambient liquid depends not only on the chemical potential difference of the transfer component but also on the interfacial free energy and composition. The latter is strongly affected by surface active agents that are present in many applications. Surfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence the mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous interfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the local hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules results in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in current continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental validation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for two-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer hindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for area-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of transfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional sorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes. The resulting model is shown to quantitatively describe experimental measurements on mass transfer reduction for the dissolution of CO$_2$ bubbles in different surfactant solutions.</description>

      <title>Feature preserving data assimilation via feature alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation combines information from physical observations and numerical simulation results to obtain better estimates of the state and parameters of a physical system. A wide class of physical systems of interest have solutions that exhibit the formation of structures, called features, which have to be accurately captured by the assimilation framework. For example, fluids can develop features such as shockwaves and contact discontinuities that need to be tracked and preserved during data assimilation. State-of-the-art data assimilation techniques are agnostic of such features. Current ensemble-based methods construct state estimates by taking linear combinations of multiple ensemble states; repeated averaging tends to smear the features over multiple assimilation cycles, leading to nonphysical state estimates. A novel feature-preserving data assimilation methodology that combines sequence alignment with the ensemble transform particle filter is proposed to overcome this limitation of existing assimilation algorithms. Specifically, optimal transport of particles is performed along feature-aligned characteristics. The strength of the proposed feature-preserving filtering approach is demonstrated on multiple test problems described by the compressible Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Thin Lubricant Films upon Liquid Contact on Slippery Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, slippery surfaces have attracted significant interest due to their excellent liquid-repellent properties and their potential in diverse commercial applications. Such surfaces are prepared by coating functionalized solid substrates with a thin lubricant film that prevents direct contact between a liquid and the substrate. The morphology of thin films upon liquid contact plays a central role in governing various phenomena, including the coalescence and mobility of liquid droplets, heat transfer efficiency, and the extent of lubricant depletion. However, a detailed understanding of film dynamics upon droplet contact remains limited, both from theoretical and experimental perspectives. Here, by employing principles of fluid dynamics, optics, and surface wetting, we present a comprehensive study that examines both the spatial and temporal variations of lubricant films upon contact with sessile liquid droplets and liquid bridges. Our findings reveal that the film dynamics can be categorized into three distinct stages, each significantly influenced by key system parameters: initial film thickness, three-phase contact line width, and Laplace pressure of liquids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by optimizing these parameters, it is possible to reverse the lubricant flow in the final stage, thereby causing the liquid to partially lift off from the slippery surface.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases with the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Insights of Transitions to Thermoacoustic Instability in Inverse Diffusion Flame using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse diffusion flame (IDF) can experience thermoacoustic instability due to variations in power input or flow conditions. However, the dynamical transitions in IDF that lead to this instability when altering control parameters have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we explore the control parameters through two different approaches and employ multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the transitions observed prior to the onset of thermoacoustic instability in the inverse diffusion flame. Our findings reveal a loss of multifractality near the region associated with thermoacoustic instability, which suggests a more ordered behavior. We determine that the singularity exponent, the width of the multifractal spectrum, and the Hurst exponent are reliable indicators of thermoacoustic instability and serve as effective classifiers of dynamical states in inverse diffusion flames.</description>

      <title>Droplet coalescence kinetics: Coalescence mechanisms and thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the droplet coalescence mechanisms and the interplay between various thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions kinetically. The main findings include: (1) Coalescence initiation and cut-through mechanisms: In non-isothermal conditions, the temperature rise caused by the release of latent heat during phase transition slightly increases the surface tension gradient (driving force) near the contact point of the two droplets, while significantly enhancing the pressure gradient (resistance). This results in a significantly prolonged coalescence initiation time compared to the isothermal case. In both cases, pressure extends the liquid-vapor interface in opposite directions, promoting the growth of the liquid bridge. (2) TNE effects: Latent heat-induced temperature rise significantly refrains the TNE intensity in thermal case. Before and after droplet contact, non-equilibrium quantities driven by the temperature gradient and those driven by the velocity gradient, alternate in dominating the coalescence process. This competition and interplay result in a more complex spatial and spatiotemporal evolution of TNE effects compared to the isothermal case. (3) Entropy production mechanisms: In the non-isothermal case, entropy production is contributed not only by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_2$ but also by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_{3,1}$, with the former being the dominant contributor. The temperature field reduces the entropy production rate, while extends its duration, and increases the total entropy production. This research provides kinetic insights for dynamic, cross-scale regulation and multifunctional integration of coalescence processes in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes in Lorentz violating black hole analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.06671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analogue models of black holes typically have collective excitations with a dispersion relation that breaks the effective Lorentz symmetry at high energy. We investigate the consequences of such Lorentz violations on the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system, that is, the modes of energy dissipation. The model involves low frequency capillary-gravity waves (whose dispersion relation can be adjusted between sub- and superluminal modifications) around a draining vortex, which mimics a rotating black hole spacetime. For a subluminal/superluminal modification, the frequency and decay rate of co-rotating modes can be reduced/increased substantially, whilst counter-rotating modes are barely affected. A further consequence of the superluminal modification is that there are no corotating QNMs above a critical rotation and no counter-rotating ones below a critical rotation for strong enough Lorentz violations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational domain and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs in the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in nonshearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>
