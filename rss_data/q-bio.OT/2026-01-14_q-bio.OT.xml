      <title>Plasma-Activated Zn, Fe, Mn Micronutrient Solutions for Crop Biofortification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micronutrient deficiency in soils limits crop productivity and reduces the nutritional quality of cereals and pulses. Conventional fertilizer supplementation often suffers from low bioavailability and environmental losses. In this study, we investigate the use of Plasma Activated Water (PAW) enriched with divalent micronutrient ions as a sustainable alternative to enhance nutrient uptake, soil fertility, and seed vigor. The PAW was generated using a gliding arc plasma system in air, and ion-enriched solutions were prepared at controlled concentrations. The physicochemical parameters (pH, ORP, conductivity, RONS species) were analyzed to assess the plasma induced reactivity. Treatments were applied to micronutrient deficient soils for wheat (Triticum aestivum) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seeds under greenhouse conditions. Results demonstrated significant enhancement in germination index, chlorophyll content, and shoot root biomass compared to controls. PAW and ionic treatments notably increased the micronutrient content in grains, indicating effective biofortification. Soil microbial activity and enzyme assays showed no toxicity and a mild stimulatory effect due to reactive nitrogen species. This study establishes a green, scalable method of delivering micronutrients through plasma-activated irrigation water, linking plasma chemistry with sustainable agronomy and nutritional security.</description>

      <title>Immunological Density Shapes Recovery Trajectories in Long COVID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) frequently persists for months, yet drivers of clinical remission remain incompletely defined.
  Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change.
  Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered).
  Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</description>

      <title>Energy per base pair model from NN parameters and its applications in genomic research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearest-neighbor(NN) free energy parameters for DNA are well studied and reliable values of these parameters exist in the literature. They have been found to be very useful in studying DNA melting and DNA stabilization studies. In this paper, using these parameters, we have constructed a model in which one can define the energy of a base pair between any two neighboring base pairs. This model allows us to use the Boltzmann weighting factor to perform Monte Carlo sampling to probe the average energy per base pair in random sequences that must have existed at the very beginning before life existed. We then employed our model to the publicly available human Genome data. We calculated the average energy per base pair in inter-gene regions where there is no overlap of genes and also for exons and introns separately. We found that (1) these 'ancient' random sequences still persist in human genome although very scarce (2) the average energy per base pair has drifted about $22.5 \%$ of the ancient value. (3) Our model together with known mutation rates provide us with a new way to look at the 'age of life'.</description>

      <title>Effect of water soaking and rooting substrates on the rooting development of salakhani pomegranate hardwood cuttings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study was carried out to evaluated the effects of soaking duration and rooting substrate on the root and shoot development of Salakhani pomegranate hardwood cuttings. The experiment was conducted at Darbandikhan Technical Institute, Sulaimani Polytechnic University, Iraq, from February to June 2025. The results showed that soaking duration had significant effect on rooting percentage, while the highest rooting percentage (60%) was obtained from the non-soaked cuttings, but prolonged soaking (48 h) resulted in the lowest rooting percentage (33.33%). Rooting substrate had a significant impact, with sand showing superior performance (75.56%) compared to the mixture (46.67%) and peat moss alone (20%). Moreover, the interactions between soaking duration and substrate revealed that soaking for 24 hours combined with sand yielded the highest rooting percentage (93.33%), while 48-hour soaking in peat moss led to complete rooting failure (0%). Root length and number were maximized in the 48 h + sand and 48 h + sand/peat moss treatments, while root biomass was highest in the 24 h + sand combination. Shoot characteristics were generally best in the control (0 h soaking), with the highest shoot length, diameter, weight, and chlorophyll content. However, the combination of 48 h soaking and sand/peat moss mixture resulted in the highest shoot length (35.44 cm) and leaf number (122), while 48 h + peat moss treatment suppressed all growth parameters. Consequently, the results suggest that immediate planting in sand or a sand/peat moss mix supports optimal rooting and shoot development.</description>
