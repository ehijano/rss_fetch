      <title>Boundary Effects in Planar Networks: Pentagons Dominate Marginal Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological and geometrical features in the boundary zone of planar polygonal networks remain poorly understood. Based on observation and mathematical proof, we propose that the average edge number of marginal cells in Pyropia haitanensis thalli, a two-dimensional (2D) biological polygonal network, is exactly five. We demonstrated that this number is maintained by specific division patterns. Furthermore, we identified profound limitations of Lewis's law and Aboav-Weaire's law by comparing the topological and geometrical parameters of marginal cells and inner cells. Strong boundary effects were manifested in the distributions of interior angles and edge lengths of marginal cells. Similar to inner cells, cell division tended to occur in marginal cells with large sizes. Our findings suggest that inner cells should be strictly defined based to their positional relationship to the marginal cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations, decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.</description>
