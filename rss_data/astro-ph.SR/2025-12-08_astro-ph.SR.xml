      <title>Polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations with FoReRo2: Instrument overview and standard stars monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a description and characterisation of the 2-Channel Focal Reducer Rozhen (FoReRo2), with an emphasis on its polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observation modes. FoReRo2 is a multimode instrument mounted at the Ritchey-Chretien(RC) focus of the 2-meter Ritchey-Chretien-Coude (RCC) telescope at the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory (BNAO) - Rozhen. The primary targets of this instrument include novae, Be/X-ray binaries, symbiotic stars, asteroids, and comets.
  Standard stars with a high degree of polarisation are an essential part of the polarimetric observations. In our sample, HD 204827 shows short-term variability in position angle, making it unsuitable for calibration. HD 183143 displays intrinsic polarisation variability but remains stable in position angle. For the first time, we present a statistical study of K and {\lambda}_max of the Serkowski law, including their mean value, standard deviation, and distribution.
  In order to show the FoReRo2 polarimetric capabilities, we also present several examples. The recurrent nova RS Oph shows variability of Serkowski's K parameter due to dust formation within the first few days after the 2021 outburst. The examples also include imaging polarimetry of comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) and spectropolarimetric observations of the symbiotic star Z And.</description>

      <title>The Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) Database: A New Database of Solar Active Region Radio Signatures from the RATAN-600 Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections, originating from solar active regions (ARs), are the primary drivers of space weather and can disrupt technological systems. Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source.</description>

      <title>High-contrast L-band Integral Field Spectroscopy of HD 33632 Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LBTI/ALES 3.07-4.08 micron spectroscopic observations of HD~33632~Ab, a ~53 M_Jup directly imaged companion to an F8 star. Spectroscopic measurements of HD 33632 Ab now span 1-4 micron, and we perform the first spectroscopic analysis covering this full range. The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion. We find significant tension between the surface gravities and object radii inferred from atmosphere model fits and those predicted by evolutionary models. We conclude with a comparison to the spectra of the HR 8799 c, d, and e, and emphasize the case that HD 33632 Ab, and other L/T transition directly imaged companions with constrained masses, will serve an essential role in understanding the complex physical processes governing the appearance of clouds in planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of SPB stars: a comparison of forward asteroseismic modelling results from Kepler and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are a class of variable star with masses between about 3 and 8 M$_{\odot}$. Their gravity-mode pulsation frequencies are sensitive to the near-core structure, which makes them useful probes of rotation and mixing in the deep stellar interior. Time series photometry, such as from the Kepler and TESS space telescopes, allows the extraction of their pulsation frequencies and construction of period spacing patterns. Previously, samples of slowly pulsating B stars were observed by the Kepler mission and underwent forward asteroseismic modelling to retrieve stellar parameters such as mass, age and core mass. However, all of these stars have since been re-observed by the ongoing TESS mission with light curves that are usually shorter and non-continuous, resulting in more difficult frequency extraction and interpretation in terms of constructing period spacing patterns. In this paper we compare the results of forward asteroseismic modelling of a sample of SPB stars using intermittent TESS light curve data to those based on long-duration Kepler light curves. We show how in some cases that the masses and core masses derived from only a few sectors of TESS data agree well with the 4-yr Kepler mission results, despite the stars having far fewer significant pulsation frequencies in their TESS light curves. However, some stars yield incompatible results, emphasising the complexities in forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity-mode pulsators with sparsely sampled or short duration TESS light curves.</description>

      <title>Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118{\deg} difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.</description>

      <title>Multiple outflows and delayed ejections revealed by early imaging of novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear eruptions on accreting white dwarfs in interacting binaries. Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $\gamma$-ray detections from $&gt;20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $\gamma$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.</description>

      <title>Machine and Deep Learning Regression for Compact Object Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central open problem in nuclear physics is the determination of a physically robust equation of state (EoS) for dense nuclear matter, which directly informs our understanding of the internal composition and macroscopic properties of compact objects such as neutron stars and quark stars. Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</description>

      <title>Multi-band ALMA Polarization Observations of BHB07-11 Reveal Aligned Dust Grains in Complex Spiral Arm Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A new Gaia census of OB associations within 1 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis via enhanced accuracy neutron-capture experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotopic abundances of r-process elements in the solar system are traditionally derived as residuals from the subtraction of s-process contributions from total solar abundances. However, the uncertainties in s-process nucleosynthesis -- particularly those arising from Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS) -- propagate directly into the r-process residuals, affecting their reliability. Building upon the seminal work of Goriely (1999), who introduced a multi-event s-process model to quantify these uncertainties, we revisit the problem using a simplified yet effective approach. By assuming that the relative uncertainty in s-process isotopic abundances scales linearly with the MACS uncertainties from data libraries (KADoNiS), we identify a subset of isotopes for which the r-process residuals remain significantly uncertain. Using updated solar abundances (Lodders 2025) and s-process contributions from Bisterzo et al. (2014), we present a short list of isotopes that are prime candidates for improved (n,g) measurements at CERN n_TOF in the near future. Our analysis provides a practical framework for prioritizing future experimental efforts that will profit from upgrades and enhancements of the n_TOF facility. It also highlights the need to revisit key neutron-capture cross sections to refine our understanding of the r-process isotopic abundance pattern, commonly used as a benchmark in stellar models of explosive nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>The lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7M$_{\odot}$ star (circumstellar model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the circumstellar model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (circumbinary fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (circumbinary realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17-0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</description>

Abstract: The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and one third of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</description>

      <title>Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Stellar cycle variability in Mount Wilson stars and dynamo models: Rotation rate and dynamo number dependency</title>

Abstract: Similar to the solar cycle, the magnetic cycles of other solar-type stars are also variable. How the variability of the stellar cycle changes with the rotation rate or the dynamo number is a valuable information for understanding the stellar dynamo process. We examine the variability in the stellar magnetic cycles by studying 81 stars from the data of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which started observations in 1966. For 28 stars, we have time series data available till 2003, while for others, the data are limited till 1995. We specifically explore how the variability changes with respect to three rotation-related parameters. We find a modest positive correlation between the variability and the stellar rotation period. In addition, we find suggestive negative correlations between the variability and the inverse squared Rossby number ($Ro^{-2}$), and the ratio of the mean cycle duration and rotation period ($\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$). Variability computed from the magnetic field of stellar dynamo models also show similar trends. Finally, inspired by previous studies, we examine dynamo number scaling in our model data and find that $Ro^{-0.6}$ (instead of $Ro^{-2}$ as suggested in the linear $\alpha \Omega$ dynamo theory) and $(\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle /P_{\rm rot})^{0.6}$ (instead of $\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$ as predicted in previous observations) are a good measure of the dynamo number. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the stellar magnetic cycle variability decreases with the increase of the rotation rate or the dynamo number.</description>

      <title>Interferometric view into RT Pav's long secondary period. binary vs oscillatory convective modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long secondary periods (LSPs) occur in about one-third of evolved stars, yet their origin remains unclear. The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step.</description>

      <title>Exploratory study on the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei and $r$-process simulation based on the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear masses of exotic nuclei are important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation, pairing correlation and continuum effects, and a mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$ has been developed based on the DRHBc theory. This work employs a methodology to estimate the masses of odd nuclei using neighboring even nuclei's masses and microscopic pairing gaps, and the performance of microscopic pairing gaps are validated by comparing with empirical ones. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is developed, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\sigma=1.47$ MeV. Then this mass table is employed in the $r$-process simulation; results show that the differences in the details of pairing gaps do not yield qualitative discrepancy in $r$-process abundances, while the deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path, suggesting that incorporating triaxiality or beyond-mean-field effects would be valuable for further improvement.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. II. The 3D spin-orbit obliquity of an eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 open cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18971</link>

Abstract: We present new analysis of the CWW 89 system as part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. The CWW 89 system is a member of the 2.8 Gyr old Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) cluster and features two stars, CWW 89A (EPIC 219388192) and CWW 89B, with the primary hosting a transiting brown dwarf. We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab. For this system in particular, we find it plausible that the brown dwarf may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity migration influence by CWW 89B.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of nonthermal sources of waves and emissions. Specific to observed non-equilibrium plasmas are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, most often described by Kappa (power-law) distributions. In this paper, we introduce an alternative modeling for linear waves in plasmas described by the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution model. This model can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons in interplanetary shocks and the solar transition region. The wave dispersion relation of longitudinal waves is derived in terms of the newly introduced Druyvesteyn dispersion function. The dispersion curves as well as damping rates of high-frequency Langmuir waves are numerically computed for the isotropic case, and their analytical approximations are provided in the limit of weak damping. We thus offer a new tool for modeling longitudinal waves, and in particular Langmuir waves under the specific conditions of Druyvesteyn distributions.</description>
