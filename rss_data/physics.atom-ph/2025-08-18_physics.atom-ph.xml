      <title>Three-dimensional Micromotion Compensation Protocols for an RF Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate four procedures for three-dimensional micromotion compensation by combining two methods: the RF-photon correlation method and the displacement method based on trap RF amplitude modulation. In ion traps, the structure of the electrodes or the vacuum chamber may restrict the laser beam incidence direction, and causes the limitation in the compensation scheme. We present four protocols, ensuring that at least one of them can be applied to experimental systems with various individual constraints. We also discuss the compensation accuracy and practical applicability of each of these four approaches. This work provides a practical guideline for performing full three-axis micromotion compensation and contributes to the advancement of endcap traps, which are highly suitable for single-ion trapping.</description>

      <title>Wavelength dependence of laser pulse filamentation around atomic resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation and nonlinear self-focusing of TW power laser pulses that create 10-m-scale, highly homogeneous plasma channels in rubidium vapor. Using computational solutions of the relevant propagation equations, we study the effects of the ionizing pulse central wavelength in relation to the resonance frequencies of atomic rubidium. Recent experiments show that pulse propagation and plasma channel creation is distinctly different for 780 nm laser pulses (resonant with the rubidium $D_2$ line) and 810 nm laser pulses. We study pulse propagation in a $\pm$30 nm range around the $D_2$ resonance and find that the results are distinctly different when tuning to sub-resonant wavelengths from those obtained for super-resonant wavelengths. For pulse wavelengths below the resonance the behavior is similar to the resonant case, characterized by strong self-focusing and a sharp plasma boundary. Pulse wavelengths above 780 nm on the other hand yield gradually weaker self-focusing and an increasingly diffuse plasma boundary. Our results suggest that the observed behavior can be attributed to an interplay between multiple factors: anomalous dispersion around atomic resonances, resonant transitions between excited states of Rb lying in the 740-780 nm range and wavelength-dependent multiphoton ionization rates.</description>

      <title>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>High-contrast double Bragg interferometry via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose high-contrast Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers based on double Bragg diffraction (DBD) operating under external acceleration. To mitigate differential Doppler shifts and experimental imperfections, we introduce a tri-frequency laser scheme with dynamic detuning control. We evaluate four detuning-control strategies&amp;mdash;conventional DBD, constant detuning, linear detuning sweep (DS-DBD), and a hybrid protocol combining detuning sweep with optimal control theory (OCT)&amp;mdash;using exact numerical simulations and a five-level S-matrix model. The OCT strategy provides the highest robustness, maintaining contrast above 95\% under realistic conditions, while the DS-DBD strategy sustains contrast above 90\% for well-collimated Bose-Einstein condensates. These results offer practical pathways to enhancing DBD-based interferometers for precision quantum sensing and fundamental physics tests.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in Graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical study of a finite-range impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional Bose gases present an interesting setting to study the physics of Bose polarons, as density fluctuations play an enhanced role due to reduced dimensionality. Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. Moreover, we provide a universal description in this limit characterized by the dimensionless ratio $\bar{w} \equiv w/\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/ \bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\bar{w}^3$.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapour medium to both microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of a conventional antenna in the detector. However, the highest sensitivity in this approach is typically achieved by introducing an additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, thereby compromising the all-optical nature of the measurement. Here we propose an alternative method, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the laser phase noise in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. We also demonstrate a quadrature-amplitude modulated data transmission, underlining the capability of the system to detect quadratures of the microwave field. This approach is thus directly comparable to the state-of-the-art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <title>Bound State Internal Interactions as a Mechanism for Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We hypothesize that the binding interactions among the components of bound systems and the background fields, sometimes known as virtual particle exchange, affect the state of the systems as do typical scattering interactions. Then with the assumption that the interior environment of unstable particles is disordered, we derive in the limit of continuous binding both an exactly exponential non-decay probability and Fermi's Golden Rule for the decay rates. The result suggests resolutions to several long-standing theoretical challenges associated with exponential decay in quantum mechanics, without appealing directly to non-Hermitian, approximate Hamiltonians or complex energies. It also contributes to a conceptual understanding of the continuum between controlled interactions that induce deviations from exponential decay, such as those in the Quantum Zeno Effect, and the uncontrolled internal dynamics of excited atoms and nuclei, which exhibit no such deviations. Finally, we examine how the binding interactions responsible for the general exponential character of decay for bound systems differ from the couplings with decay products that control decay rates, providing insight into challenges in quantum computing and information processing.</description>
