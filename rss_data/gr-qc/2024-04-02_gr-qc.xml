      <title>Systematic bias from waveform modeling for binary black hole populations in next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have increased sensitivity and observing volumes, enabling unprecedented precision in parameter estimation. However, this enhanced precision could also reveal systematic biases arising from waveform modeling, which may impact astrophysical inference. We investigate the extent of these biases over a year-long observing run with $10^5$ simulated binary black hole sources using the linear signal approximation. To establish a conservative estimate, we sample binaries from a smoothed truncated power-law population model and compute systematic parameter biases between the IMRPhenomXAS and IMRPhenomD waveform models. For sources with signal-to-noise ratios above 100, we estimate statistically significant parameter biases in $\sim 3\%-20\%$ of the events, depending on the parameter. We find that the average mismatch between waveform models required to achieve a bias of $\leq 1\sigma$ for $99\%$ of detections with signal-to-noise ratios $\geq 100$ should be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, or at least one order of magnitude better than current levels of waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tides during the inspiral of rapidly spinning neutron stars: Solutions beyond mode resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical tide in coalescing binaries involving neutron stars (NSs). The deformed NS is assumed to spin rapidly, with its spin axis anti-aligned with the orbit. Such an NS may exist if the binary forms dynamically, and it can lead to a strong tide because the NS f-mode can be resonantly excited during the inspiral. We present a new analytical solution for the f-mode resonance by decomposing the tide into a resummed equilibrium component varying at the forcing frequency and a dynamical component varying at the mode eigenfrequency. This solution simplifies numerical implementations by avoiding the subtraction of two diverging terms. It also extends the solution's validity to frequencies beyond mode resonance. When the dynamical tide back reacts on the orbit, the effective Love number alone is insufficient because it does not capture the tidal torque on the orbit that dominates the back reaction during resonance. An additional dressing factor is therefore introduced to model the torque. The dissipative interaction between the NS and the orbital mass multipoles is computed including the dynamical tide and shown to be subdominant compared to the conservative interaction. We show that orbital phase shifts caused by the $l=3$ and $l=2$ f-modes can reach 0.5 and 10 radians at their respective resonances. Because of the large impact of the dynamical tide, a linearized description becomes insufficient, calling for future developments to incorporate higher-order corrections. After mode excitation, the orbit cannot remain quasi-circular, and the eccentricity excited by the $l=2$ dynamical tide can approach nearly $e\simeq 0.1$, leading to non-monotonic frequency evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate that the GW radiation from the resonantly excited f-mode alone can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding unity at a distance of 50 Mpc with the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>What an event is not: unravelling the identity of events in quantum theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the notion of events at the intersection between quantum physics and gravity, inspired by recent research on superpositions of semiclassical spacetimes. By going through various experiments and thought experiments -- from a decaying atom, to the double-slit experiment, to the quantum switch -- we analyse which properties can and cannot be used to define events in such non-classical contexts. Our findings suggest an operational, context-dependent definition of events which emphasises that their properties can be accessed without destroying or altering observed phenomena. We discuss the implications of this understanding of events for indefinite causal order as well as the non-absoluteness of events in the Wigner's friend thought experiment. These findings provide a first step for developing a notion of event in quantum spacetime.</description>

      <title>Spherical symmetric solutions of conformal Killing gravity: black holes, wormholes, and sourceless cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most general set of static and spherically symmetric solutions for conformal Killing gravity coupled to Maxwell fields is presented in closed form. These solutions, depending on six parameters, include non-asymptotically flat black holes or naked singularities, non-asymptotically flat traversable wormholes, and (possibly singularity-free) closed universes. We also consider the inverse problem, showing that the most general energy-momentum tensor generating a given static spherically symmetric metric depends on three parameters. Sourceless time-dependent isotropic solutions are also given. These solutions depending on the curvature, the cosmological constant, and a new integration constant $\alpha$, present a rich variety, including singularity-free eternal cosmologies and universes evolving symmetrically from a big bang to a big crunch within a finite lapse of time.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spheres Via Embedding Approach in $f(R,\phi, X)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the behavior of stellar structure through embedding approach in $f(R, \phi, X)$ modified theory of gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar, $\phi$ represents the scalar potential and $X$ indicates the kinetic potential. For this purpose, we consider the spherically symmetric space-time with anisotropic fluid. We further choose three different stars i.e. LMC X-4, Cen X-3, and EXO 1785-248 to demonstrate the behavior of stellar structures. We further compare the Schwarzschild space-time as exterior geometry with spherically symmetric space-time to calculate the values of unknown parameters. In this regard, we investigate the graphical features of stellar spheres such es energy density, pressure components, anisotropic component, equation of state parameters, stability analysis and energy conditions. Furthermore, we investigate some extra conditions such as mass function, compactness factor and surface redshift respectively. Conclusively, all the compact stars under observations are realistic, stable, and are free from any physical or geometrical singularities. We find that the embedding class one solution for anisotropic compact stars is viable and stable.</description>

      <title>Probing Baryogenesis in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of matter domination in the Universe is one of the most exciting open puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. Despite many theoretical developments, the actual reason behind baryon-antibaryon asymmetry is still unknown. Our aim here is to examine this phenomenon in the framework of modified gravity theories, which have impressively elucidated the contemporary accelerated expansion of the universe as well as the early phase. Consequently, this letter sets its sights on the task of constraining a specific variant of modified gravity, namely, $f(Q)$ gravity, in conjunction with gravitational baryogenesis. The Power Law model and recently proposed DGP-like $f(Q)$ models are considered to find the baryon-to-entropy ratio and compare them with the observed value, that is ${n_B}/s=9.42\times 10^{-11}$. Furthermore, we impose constraints on the additional degrees of freedom introduced by this modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Study of Viable Compact Stellar Structures in Non-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this article is to study the viable compact stellar structures in non-Riemannian geometry, i.e., $f(\mathbb{Q},T)$ theory, where $\mathbb{Q}$ defines the non-metricity and $T$ represents trace of the stress-energy tensor. In this perspective, we consider a static spherical metric with anisotropic matter configuration to examine the geometry of considered compact stars. A specific model of this theory is used to derive the explicit expressions of energy density and pressure components that govern the relationship between matter and geometry. The unknown parameters are evaluated by using the continuity of inner and outer spacetimes to examine the configuration of spherical stellar structures. Physical parameters such as fluid characteristics, energy constraints and equation of state parameters are analyzed to examine the viability of the considered stellar objects. Further, we use Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, sound speed and adiabatic index methods to analyze the equilibrium state and stability of the proposed stellar objects. The rigorous analysis and satisfaction of necessary conditions lead to the conclusion that the stellar objects studied in this framework are viable and stable.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in quantum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the entanglement entropy for a massive Klein-Gordon field in two Schwarzschild-like quantum black hole spacetimes, also including a nonminimal coupling term with the background scalar curvature. To compute the entanglement entropy, we start from the standard spherical shell discretisation procedure, tracing over the degrees of freedom residing inside an imaginary surface. We estimate the free parameters for such quantum metrics through a simple physical argument based on Heisenberg uncertainty principle, along with alternative proposals as asymptotic safety, trace anomaly, and graviton corpuscular scaling. Our findings reveal a significant decrease in entropy compared to the area law near the origin for the quantum metrics. In both scenarios, the entanglement entropy converges to the expected area law sufficiently far from the origin. We then compare these results to the entropy scaling in regular Hayward and corrected-Hayward spacetimes to highlight the main differences with such regular approaches.</description>

      <title>A systematic comparison of slow contraction and inflation as mechanisms for solving the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a systematic study, we use an equivalent pair of improved numerical relativity codes based on a tetrad-formulation of the classical Einstein-scalar field equations to examine whether slow contraction or inflation (or both) can resolve the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems. Our finding, based on a set of gauge/frame invariant diagnostics, is that slow contraction robustly and rapidly smooths and flattens spacetime beginning from initial conditions that are outside the perturbative regime of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, whereas inflation fails these tests. We present new numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that the combination of ultralocal evolution and an effective equation-of-state with pressure much greater than energy density is the key to having robust and rapid smoothing. The opposite of ultralocality occurs in expanding spacetimes, which is the leading obstruction to smoothing following a big bang.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bouncing Cosmology in Non-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this manuscript is to investigate the bouncing cosmology in the background of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}$ defines the non-metricity. For this purpose, we use the reconstruction approach and consider a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime with perfect matter configuration. We examine how the first contracting phase gives the expansion by using a temporal derivative of the scale factor, i.e., $\dot{a}&lt;0$, $\dot{a}=0$ and $\dot{a}&gt;0$ give contraction, bounce point and expansion phases, respectively. Further, we use the order reduction method to solve the modified field equations as these are very difficult due to the presence of additional non-linear expressions. It is analyzed that the original singularity of the universe diminishes for the required bounce conditions. We conclude that the acceleration occurs near the bouncing point and the considered $f(\mathcal{Q})$ models are consistent with the current cosmic accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal; and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; but has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr Hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A time-like membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon which is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the Membrane Paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>Stablity of charged scalar hair on a charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Israel-Carter theorem (also known as the ``no-hair theorem'') puts a restriction on the existence of parameters other than mass, electric charge, and angular momentum of a black hole. In this context, Bekenstein proposed no-hair theorems in various black hole models with neutral and electrically charged scalar fields.
  In this paper, we take the Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar model with an electrically charged scalar field gauge-coupled to the Maxwell field surrounding a charged black hole in the background of a static spherically symmetric metric. We ascertain the validity of all energy conditions coupled with the causality condition, suggesting the possibility of existence of charged hairy solutions. Consequently, we obtain, by exact numerical integration, detailed solutions of the field equations in this model. The solutions exhibit damped oscillatory behaviours for the charged scalar hair. We also find that the electric potential $V(r)$ is a monotonic function of $r$, as required by electrodynamics.
  Furthermore, we find that the charged hairy solutions are stable against time-dependant perturbations about the static solutions. We ascertain their stability by carrying out dynamic stability analyses, employing two different methodologies. The first methodology is based on a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the second methodology employs a Schrodinger-like equation for the dynamic perturbations. We find stability of the charged hairy solutions in both stability analyses.</description>

      <title>Improved Moving-Puncture Techniques for Compact Binary Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully unlock the scientific potential of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, numerical relativity (NR) simulation accuracy must be greatly enhanced. We present three infrastructure-agnostic improvements to the moving-puncture approach for binary black hole (BBH) simulations, aimed at significantly reducing constraint violation and improving GW predictions. Although these improvements were developed within the highly efficient NR code BlackHoles@Home, we demonstrate their effectiveness in the widely adopted Einstein Toolkit/Carpet AMR framework. Our improvements include a modified Kreiss-Oliger dissipation prescription, a Hamiltonian-constraint-damping adjustment to the BSSN equations, and an additional term to the 1+log lapse evolution equation that slows the development of the sharp lapse feature, which dominates numerical errors in BBH simulations. With minimal increase in computational cost, these improvements significantly reduce GW noise, enabling the extraction of high-order GW modes previously obscured by numerical noise. They also improve convergence properties, reduce Hamiltonian (momentum) constraint violations in the strong-field region by approximately two (three) orders of magnitude, and in the GW-extraction zone by six (two) orders of magnitude. To promote community adoption, we have open-sourced the improved Einstein Toolkit thorn BaikalVacuum used in this work. Although our focus is on BBH evolutions and the BSSN formulation, these improvements may also benefit compact binary simulations involving matter and other formulations, a focus for future investigations.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems formulation for inhomogeneous LRS-II spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical system formulation for inhomogeneous LRS-II spacetimes using the covariant 1+1+2 decomposition approach. Our approach describes the LRS-II dynamics from the point of view of a comoving observer. Promoting the covariant radial derivatives of the covariant dynamical quantities to new dynamical variables and utilizing the commutation relation between the covariant temporal and radial derivatives, we were able to construct an autonomous system of first-order ordinary differential equations along with some purely algebraic constraints. Using our dynamical system formulation we found several interesting features in the LRS-II phase space with dust, one of them being that the homogeneous solutions constitute an invariant submanifold. For the particular case of LTB, we were also able to recover the previously known result that an expanding LTB tends to Milne in the absence of a cosmological constant, providing a potential validation of our formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission aided by a gravitational lens. We find that optimal reception efficiency occurs in lensing geometries where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. We explore various signal detection strategies, employing both existing and emerging technologies. With this study, our understanding of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing has significantly progressed. We observe that detection signals from nearby stars, may leverage established photonics and optical engineering technologies, and networks of collaborative astronomical facilities. Our findings support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <title>Engineered Graviton Condensates in a Room-Temperature Superconductor for a Unified Quantum Fibonacci Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, the concept of gravitons as quantum carriers of gravitational force stands as a pivotal yet unproven hypothesis. This work pioneers a bold approach to graviton condensation via an innovative ambient superconductor, synthesized through a groundbreaking yet theoretically plausible physics process. Building on recent superconductivity breakthroughs, we introduce a novel ambient superconductor fabricated through the bombardment of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate with high-energy gamma photons, under precisely controlled magnetic fields oscillating in Fibonacci sequence patterns. This process, designed to exploit quantum coherence at macroscopic scales, fosters conditions ripe for graviton condensation. Here we demonstrate the successful induction of a graviton condensate within our engineered superconductor, marking a significant stride towards integrating gravitational and electromagnetic forces at a quantum level. This discovery not only defies traditional views separating the four fundamental interactions but also lays down a tangible groundwork for quantum gravity. Our results challenge existing paradigms by indicating that graviton condensation, mediated through tailored superconducting states, can unlock new aspects of fundamental physics. This graviton condensate represents a critical step towards a unified field theory, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. This investigation not only extends the boundaries of theoretical physics but also hints at potential future technologies harnessing the quantum interplay of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Through imaginative yet rigorous scientific inquiry, this study underscores the limitless potential of physics to explore and unify the natural world's most fundamental forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic of holography between anti-de Sitter space holography and de Sitter holography is a very fascinating comparison, which provides many key insights into what we expect from holography in general. In this Essay, we highlight this dynamic with three examples: first, when taking Wheeler-DeWitt states to the asymptotic boundary, the dual interpretation is unclear in de Sitter. Second, what we make of bulk reconstruction and subregion duality in AdS/CFT is not trivially reflected in the dS/CFT scenario. Third, a way of formulating emergence and subregion-subalgebra duality in de Sitter space does not yet exist. With these examples, we provide some musings on this canvas of holography in the settings of (A)dS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in the Dark?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Decoding rotating neutron stars: Role of the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In December 2023, the Fermi LAT Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope $(L)$ affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 solar mass, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 $M_\odot$ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars' radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope.</description>

      <title>Cosmological mass of the photon related to Stueckelberg and Higgs mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider electro-weak (EW) masses and interactions generated for photons by vacuum expectation values of Stueckelberg and Higgs fields. I provide a prescription to relate their parametric values to a cosmological range derived from a fundamental Heisenberg uncertainty principle and Einstein-de Sitter cosmological constant and horizon. This yields qualitative connections between microscopic ranges acquired by $W^{\pm}$ or $Z^0$ gauge Bosons and the cosmological scale and minimal mass acquired by $g$-photons. I apply that procedure to an established Stueckelberg-Higgs mechanism, while I consider a similar procedure for a pair of Higgs fields that may spontaneously break all U(1)xSU(2) gauge invariances. My estimates of photon masses and their additional parity-breaking interactions with leptons and neutrinos may be detectable in suitable accelerator experiments. Their effects may also be observable astronomically through massive $g$-photon condensates that may contribute to dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole Moment of a Magnetically Confined Mountain on an Accreting Neutron Star in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity and hence the gravitational wave strain is $4\%$ to $12\%$ smaller than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is also considered, and it is shown that it is negligible in systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>

Our proposed ultra-cold candidatae has been a matter of speculation for some time,and has recently been tentatively identified via direct-detection. While unconventional, demonstrated existence of this DM candidate would have wide-ranging implications for a range of fields, from particle cosmology to exobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life (SETI).</description>

      <title>Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth recoils and hierarchical-formation viability of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernova (PISN) is thought to prevent the formation of black holes from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form through hierarchical formation channels, as the result of merging "ancestor" black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' black hole, namely its mass, spin, and recoil velocity (or kick). Crucially, the child black hole will be expelled from its host environment if its "birth kick" exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing it from undergoing further mergers. In this work, we exploit tight relations between the final kick and final spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth kicks of the component black holes of GW190521, assuming both quasi-circular (with generic spins) eccentric (aligned-spin) scenarios for the latter. With this, we evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes, being retained by the host environment. For the primary component BH1, which falls squarely in the PISN mass gap, we find that such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster, unless GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors, characteristic of isolated black-hole binary formation scenarios. Similarly, for denser host environments (excluding AGNs), we only obtain probabilities $p_{2g} &gt; 0.5$ if GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors. If GW190521 was eccentric, we find maximal values $p_{2g}$ of only $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ which require ancestral mass ratios $q\geq 2$, untypical of isolated formation scenarios. Our results seem consistent with an AGN origin for GW190521, especially if this was eccentric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography for the de-Sitter space a bulk theory. First, we discuss a more general mathematical construction of wedge holography in parallel with wedge holography construction for the AdS bulk, and then we construct the wedge holography in the extended static patch. In the first case, we prove that one can construct wedge holography for the de-Sitter bulk for the static patch as well as global coordinate metric on end-of-the-world branes. Extended static patch wedge holography is constructed by joining the two copies of double holography in DS/dS correspondence. We find that wedge holography with extended static patch metric leads to the emergence of communicating universes. Further, we propose a model which provides the theoretical evidence of communicating multiverses.</description>

Abstract: Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.</description>

Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if provided enough training data. This work identifies the prospects and the main challenges for developing machine learning techniques that are capable of accurately classifying observationally viable topologies.</description>

Abstract: Working within the quasi-metric framework (QMF), it is examined if the gravitational field exterior to an isolated, spherically symmetric body is necessarily metrically static, or equivalently, whether or not Birkhoff's theorem holds for quasi-metric gravity. It is found that it does; however the proof is somewhat different from the general-relativistic case.</description>

      <title>Boyer-Lindquist space-times and beyond: Meta-material analogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.09807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogue space-times (and in particular metamaterial analogue space-times) have a long varied and complex history. Much of the previous related work has focused on spherically symmetric models; however, axial symmetry is much more relevant for mimicking rotating systems. It is well known that physically reasonable stationary axisymmetric space-times can, under very mild technical conditions, be put into Boyer--Lindquist form. Unfortunately, a metric presented in Boyer--Lindquist form is not well adapted to the "quasi-Cartesian" analysis that we developed in our previous articles on "bespoke analogue space-times". Herein, we shall first focus specifically on various space-time metrics presented in Boyer--Lindquist form, and subsequently determine a suitable set of equivalent metamaterial susceptibility tensors in a laboratory setting. We shall then turn to analyzing generic space-times, not even necessarily stationary, again determining a suitable set of equivalent metamaterial susceptibility tensors. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the well-known ADM formalism proves to be not particularly useful, and that instead the dual "threaded" (Kaluza--Klein--inspired) formalism provides much more tractable results. While the background laboratory metric is (for mathematical simplicity and physical plausibility) always taken to be Riemann flat, we {will} allow for arbitrary curvilinear coordinate systems on the flat background space-time. Finally, for completeness, we shall reconsider spherically symmetric space-times, but now in general spherical polar coordinates rather than quasi-Cartesian coordinates. In summary, this article provides a set of general-purpose calculational tools that can readily be adapted for mimicking various interesting (curved) space-times by using nontrivial susceptibility tensors in general (background-flat) laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Novel setup for detecting short-range anisotropic corrections to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that, even though there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to expect a violation of spatial isotropy at short distances, contemporary setups for probing gravitational interactions at short distances have not been configured to measure such spatial anisotropies. We propose a simple modification to the state-of-the-art torsion pendulum design and numerically demonstrate that it suppresses signals due to the large spatially-isotropic component of the gravitational force while maintaining a high sensitivity to short-range spatial anisotropies. We incorporate anisotropy using both Yukawa-type and power-law-type short-distance corrections to gravity. The proposed differential torsion pendulum is shown to be capable of making sensitive measurements of small gravitational anisotropies and the resulting anisotropic torques are largely independent of the details of the underlying short-distance modification to gravity. Thus, if there is an anisotropic modification to gravity, from any theory, in any form of the modified potential, the proposed setup provides a practical means of detecting it.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Black Holes in 4D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the recent derivation of a well-defined $D\rightarrow 4$ limit for regularized 4D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. In this paper we construct slowly rotating black hole solutions for 4DEGB gravity in asymptotically flat, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. At leading order in the rotation parameter, exact solutions of the metric functions are derived and studied for all three of these cases. We compare how physical properties (innermost stable circular orbits, photon rings, black hole shadow, etc.) of the solutions are modified by varying coupling strengths of the 4DEGB theory relative to standard Einstein gravity results. We find that a vanishing or negative cosmological constant in 4DEGB gravity enforces a minimum mass on the black hole solutions, whereas a positive cosmological constant enforces both a minimum \textit{and} maximum mass with a horizon root structure directly analogous to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter spacetime. Besides this, many of the physical properties are qualitatively similar to general relativity, with the greatest deviations typically being found in the low (near-minimal) mass regime.</description>

      <title>On Thermodynamic Stability of Black Holes. Part I: Classical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classical thermodynamic stability of the standard black hole solutions by implementing the intrinsic necessary and sufficient conditions for stable global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. The criteria for such equilibria are quite generic and well-established in classical thermodynamics, but they have not been fully utilized in black hole physics. We show how weaker or incomplete conditions could lead to misleading or incorrect results for the thermodynamic stability of the system. We also stress the importance of finding all possible local heat capacities in order to fully describe the classical equilibrium picture of black holes. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the critical and phase transition curves and the limits of the classical analysis. This paper is the first in the line of intended works on thermodynamic stability of black holes in modified theories of gravity and holography.</description>

      <title>Constraint on cosmological constant in generalized Skryme-teleparallel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Skyrme system is understood to defy the "no hair" conjecture by possessing black-hole solutions with fractional baryon number outside the event horizon. In this article, we extend the study of the Skyrme system to teleparallel gravity framework. We consider two scenarios, the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and generalized teleparallel gravity $f(T)$. In our analysis, we compute the fractional baryon number beyond the black-hole horizon and its correlation with the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). In the TEGR context, where $f(T) = -T - 2\Lambda$, the results match with the Einstein-Skyrme model, assuming a positive $\Lambda$. More interestingly, in generalized teleparallel gravity scenario, defined by $f(T) = -T - \tau T^2 - 2\Lambda$, we show that the existence of a solution demands that not only must $\Lambda$ be positive but has to lie in a range, $\Lambda_{min} &lt; \Lambda &lt; \Lambda_{max}$. While the upper bound depends inversely on $\tau$, the lower bound is a linear function of it. Hence, in the limiting case with generalized teleparallel gravity converging towards TEGR ($\tau \rightarrow 0$), the constraints on the cosmological constant relax to the Einstein Skryme system ($\Lambda_{min}$ approaches zero and $\Lambda_{max}$ becomes unbounded). On the other hand, in f(T) gravity, vanishing cosmological constant solution is found only if the lower bound on the energy of the soliton is very large.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non--commutativity as a Perturbation in the Schwarzschild Black Hole: Quasinormal Modes, Scattering, and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, by a novel approach to studying the scattering of a Schwarzschild black hole, the non--commutativity is introduced as a perturbation. We begin by reformulating the Klein--Gordon equation for the scalar field in a new form that takes into account the deformed non--commutative spacetime. Using this formulation, an effective potential for the scattering process is derived. To calculate the quasinormal modes, we employ the WKB method and also utilize fitting techniques to investigate the impact of non--commutativity on the scalar quasinormal modes. We thoroughly analyze the results obtained from these different methods. Moreover, the greybody factor and absorption cross section are investigated. Additionally, we explore the behavior of null geodesics in the presence of non--commutativity. Specifically, we examine the photonic, and shadow radius as well as the light trajectories for different non--commutative parameters. Therefore, by addressing these various aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of non--commutativity on the scattering of a Schwarzschild--like black hole and its implications for the behavior of scalar fields and light trajectories.</description>

      <title>Scalar Cosmological Perturbations from Quantum Entanglement within Lorentzian Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the dynamics of (isotropic) scalar perturbations from the mean-field hydrodynamics of full Lorentzian quantum gravity, as described by a two-sector (timelike and spacelike) Barrett-Crane group field theory (GFT) model. The rich causal structure of this model allows us to consistently implement in the quantum theory the causal properties of a physical Lorentzian reference frame composed of four minimally coupled, massless, and free scalar fields. Using this frame, we are able to effectively construct relational observables that are used to recover macroscopic cosmological quantities. In particular, small isotropic scalar inhomogeneities emerge as a result of (relational) nearest-neighbor two-body entanglement between degrees of freedom of the underlying quantum gravity theory. The dynamical equations we obtain for geometric and matter perturbations show agreement with those of classical general relativity in the long-wavelength, super-horizon limit. In general, deviations become important for sub-horizon modes, which seem to be naturally associated with a trans-Planckian regime in our physical reference frame. We argue that these trans-Planckian corrections are quantum gravitational in nature. However, we explicitly show that for some physically interesting solutions these quantum gravity effects can be quite small, leading to a very good agreement with the classical GR behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor cosmologies with alternative connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In symmetric teleparallel geometry the curvature and torsion tensors are assumed to vanish identically, while the dynamics of gravity is encoded by nonmetricity. Here the spatially homogeneous and isotropic connections that can accompany flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric come in three sets. As the trivial set has received much attention, we focus on the two alternative sets which introduce an extra degree of freedom into the equations. Working in the context of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor gravity with generic nonminimal coupling and potential, we show that the extra free function in the connection can not play the role of dark matter nor dark energy, but it drastically alters the scalar field behavior. We determine the restrictions on the model functions which permit the standard cosmological scenario of successive radiation, dust matter, and scalar potential domination eras to be stable. However, the alternative connections also introduce a rather general possibility of the system meeting a singularity in finite time.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic radiation emitted by an accelerated charged particle can be described theoretically as the interaction of the charge with the so-called Fulling-Davies-Unruh thermal bath in the coordinate frame co-accelerated with the charge. We present a similar analysis on the gravitational radiation from a classical point mass uniformly accelerated, being pulled by a string satisfying the weak energy condition. In particular, we derive the interaction rate (with fixed transverse momentum) of this system of the point mass and string in the Fulling-Davies-Unruh thermal bath in the co-accelerated frame and show that it equals the graviton emission rate calculated in the standard method in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a screening mechanism in the context of scalar-vector-tensor (SVT) theories. This screening mechanism is based on both the derivative self-interactions of the vector field and the interactions of the scalar field with the vector field and curvature. We calculate the field equations in a spherically symmetric space-time, and then, we study the conditions for which this mechanism is successful in a weak gravitational background. In order to corroborate these analytical results, we have performed a numerical integration of the full equations. Finally, the corrections to the gravitational potentials have also been computed. We conclude that the present model, including both kinds of interactions, can avoid the propagation of the additional longitudinal mode arising in these theories. We also show that the space parameter of the model is compatible with solar system constraints. This result extends the previous one found in the literature for generalized Proca theories to the case of SVT theories in the presence of scalar-vector interactions.</description>

Abstract: In our investigation, we explore the quantum dynamics of charge-free scalar particles through the Klein-Gordon equation within the framework of rainbow gravity's, considering the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda (BML) space-time background. The BML solution is characterized by the magnetic field strength along the axis of symmetry direction which is related with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the topological parameter $\alpha$ of the geometry. The behavior of charge-free scalar particles described by the Klein-Gordon equation is investigated, utilizing two sets of rainbow functions: (i) $f(\chi)=\frac{(e^{\beta\,\chi}-1)}{\beta\,\chi}$,\, $h(\chi)=1$ and (ii) $f(\chi)=1$,\, $h(\chi)=1+\frac{\beta\,\chi}{2}$. Here $0 &lt; \Big(\chi=\frac{|E|}{E_p}\Big) \leq 1$ with $E$ represents the particle's energy, $E_p$ is the Planck's energy, and $\beta$ is the rainbow parameter. We obtain the approximate analytical solutions for the scalar particles and conduct a thorough analysis of the obtained results. Afterwards, we study the quantum dynamics of quantum oscillator fields within this BML space-time, employing the Klein-Gordon oscillator. Here also, we choose the same sets of rainbow functions and obtained approximate eigenvalue solution for the oscillator fields. Notably, we demonstrate that the relativistic approximate energy profiles of charge-free scalar particles and oscillator fields get influenced by the topology of the geometry and the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we show that the energy profiles of scalar particles get modifications by the rainbow parameter and the quantum oscillator fields by both the rainbow parameter and the frequency of oscillation</description>

Our analysis centers around the Klein-Gordon equation, and we obtain both approximate and exact analytical solutions for spin-0 particles of the quantum system. Afterwards, we explore quantum oscillator fields by considering the Klein-Gordon oscillator within the same space-time characterized by a cosmological constant. We obtain an approximate expression for the energy eigenvalue of the oscillator fields. In fact, the energy spectrum in both scenarios are examined and show the influences of the cosmological constant and geometry's topology.

Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 scalar particles, as described by the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation, within the framework of a magnetic space-time. Our focus is on the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda (BML) solution, a four-dimensional magnetic universe characterized by a magnetic field that varies with axial distance. To initiate this investigation, we derive the radial equation using a suitable wave function ansatz and subsequently employ special functions to solve it. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator fields within the same BML space-time background. We derive the corresponding radial equation and solve it using special functions. Significantly, our results show that the geometry's topology and the cosmological constant (both are related with the magnetic field strength) influences the eigenvalue solution of spin-0 DKP fields and DKP-oscillator fields, leading to substantial modifications in the overall outcomes</description>

      <title>Observational imprints of gravastars from accretion disks and hot-spots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the observational properties of thin-shell gravastars under two astrophysical frameworks, namely surrounded by optically-thin accretion disks and orbited by hot-spots. We consider the thin-shell gravastar model with two free parameters, the gravastar radius and ratio of mass allocated at the thin-shell, and produce the corresponding observables via the use of numerical backwards ray-tracing codes. Regarding the observations of accretion disks, our results indicate that, due to the absence of a strong gravitational redshift effect, smooth gravastar configurations cannot reproduce shadow observations when internal emission is assumed. We thus expect such models to be excluded as candidates for supermassive objects in galactic cores. Nevertheless, thin-shell gravastars with a large portion of their total mass allocated at the surface can produce such an effect and are thus adequate candidates for black-hole mimickers. In the context of hot-spot orbits, the astrometrical observational properties of ultra-compact gravastars resemble closely those of other ultra-compact objects e.g. fluid stars and bosonic stars. However, for low-compacticity configurations, the time-integrated fluxes feature additional contributions in the form of a high-intensity plunge through image. These qualitative differences in the observational properties of gravastars in comparison with black-hole spacetimes could potentially be discriminated by the next generation of interferometric experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in Hairy Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, since its proposal, has always been a controversial hypothesis, but its significance in astrophysics is undeniable. For a regular black hole, its center does not contain a singularity, and the destruction of the horizon of such black holes is not protected by the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. Therefore, we employ Gedanken experiments to study the hairy Kerr black holes, which are promising candidates to serve as "simulators" of astrophysical black holes. By investigating these black holes through testing particles and scalar fields carrying large angular momentum, we explore whether these black holes can achieve overspinning. Our results suggest that the overspinning behavior of these hairy Kerr black holes in extremal or near-extremal conditions strongly depends on the hairy parameters (${\alpha, l_0}$). This not only potentially offers us an opportunity to explore the interior structure of black holes, but may also provide clues for constraining the hairy parameters. This phenomenon might reveal the connection between the no-hair theorem of black holes and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, bringing new perspectives to our understanding of these theories.</description>

      <title>The resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Field Perturbations of Black Holes Immersed in Chaplygin-Like Dark Fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes, the de Sitter modes as well as the near extremal modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on the families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Rotating Fermion-Boson Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating fermion-boson stars are hypothetical celestial objects that consist of both fermionic and bosonic matter interacting exclusively through gravity. Bosonic fields are believed to arise in certain models of particle physics describing dark matter and could accumulate within neutron stars, modifying some of their properties and gravitational wave emission. Fermion-boson stars have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers. However, stationary rotating configurations were yet to be found and investigated. The presence of a bosonic component could impact the development of the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars. Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter equation of state from multi-messenger observations. In this work we study a new consistent method of constructing uniformly rotating fermion-boson stars and we analyse some of their main properties. These objects might offer alternative explanations for current observations populating the lower black-hole mass gap, as the $2.6 M_\odot$ compact object involved in GW190814.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of Bianchi-I space-times within the framework of the Horndeski theory with $G_5=\text{const}/X$. The space-times are filled a global unidirectional electromagnetic field interacting with a scalar field. We consider the minimal interaction and the non-minimal interaction by the law $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time, so the question arises of regulating the anisotropic level in this theory. Using the reconstruction method, we build models in which the anisotropic level tends to a small value as the Universe expands. One of the results is a model with a anisotropic bounce.</description>

      <title>Wormhole solutions under the effect of dark matter in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the background of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, this work investigates three distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters. In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in the galactic halo.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Kodama state by quantizing the theory of General Relativity (GR) with dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity. We find a new exact solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation where the Pontryagin term induces a modification in the Kodama state from quantizing GR alone. The dCS modification directly encodes the variation of the cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: The shortest distance around the Universe through us is unlikely to be much larger than the horizon diameter if microwave background anomalies are due to cosmic topology. We show that observational constraints from the lack of matched temperature circles in the microwave background leave many possibilities for such topologies. We evaluate the detectability of microwave background multipole correlations for sample cases. Searches for topology signatures in observational data over the large space of possible topologies pose a formidable computational challenge.</description>

      <title>Universe bouncing its way to inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological models with inflation and those with bounce have their own strengths and weaknesses. Here we construct a model in which a phase of bounce is followed by a viable inflationary phase. This incorporates several advantages of both and hence, is a more viable model for cosmic evolution. We explore scenarios wherein the bouncing phase smoothly transits to an inflationary one, with the pivot scale leaving the Hubble horizon during the latter era, thereby maintaining consistency with observations. Staying within the ambit of Einstein-Hilbert gravity augmented by the inflaton, we ensure a pre-inflationary bounce by introducing a second scalar field that helps engineer the requisite violation of the null energy condition. Potential ghost instabilities can be mitigated by invoking a non-trivial coupling between the two scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Thermodynamics of Charged Black Holes in Higher Derivative Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection between bulk and boundary thermodynamics in Einstein-Maxwell theory is well established using AdS/CFT correspondence. In the context of general higher derivative gravity coupled to a U(1) gauge field, we examine the resemblance of the first law of thermodynamics between bulk and boundary, followed by an extended phase space description on both sides. Higher derivative terms related to different powers of the string theory parameter $\alpha'$ emerged from a consistent truncation in the bulk supergravity action. We demonstrate that one must include the fluctuation of $\alpha'$ in the bulk thermodynamics as a bookkeeping tool to match the bulk first law and Smarr relation with the boundary side. Consequently, the Euler relation and the boundary first law are altered by adding two central charges ($\mathtt{a}$, $\mathtt{c}$). To support our general conclusion, we consider the black hole in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and the general four-derivative theory. Finally, we examine the bulk and boundary aspects of the extended phase space description for higher derivative corrected black holes.</description>

Abstract: The microseismic motion, which is the ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves such as seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded to explain the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is the microseismic forecast and its example is also shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ scattering amplitudes in curved space to model the dynamics of a light probe particle with mass $m$ orbiting in the background spacetime induced by a heavy gravitational source with mass $M$. Observables are organized as an expansion in $m/M$ to all orders in $G$ -- the gravitational self-force expansion. An essential component of our analysis is the backreaction of the heavy source which we capture by including the associated light degrees of freedom. As illustration we consider a Schwarzschild background and verify geodesic motion as well as the first-order self-force correction to two-body scattering through ${\cal O}(G^3)$. Amplitudes in curved space offer several advantages, and further developments along these lines may advance the computation of gravitational-wave signals for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of reheating in inflationary models is crucial for understanding the early universe and gaining insights into inflationary dynamics and parameters. The reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the duration of the reheating phase, quantified by the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, have significant implications for particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. The duration of reheating affects particle abundance, including dark matter, and shapes the primordial power spectrum and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. By combining cosmological observations and theoretical considerations, we can constrain both $T_{re}$ and $N_{re}$, which in turn constrain the spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and inflation model parameters. Utilizing consistency relations among observables, such as $n_s$ and $r$, provides additional constraints on inflationary models and determines bounds for other observables like the running of the scalar spectral index. These bounds are valuable for assessing the viability of models and can serve to specify priors in Bayesian analyses of specific models. As an example of how to proceed, we study in detail a particular case of a generalized $\alpha$-attractor model that accurately reproduces observed quantities. We present equations for the conditions of instantaneous reheating, establish consistency relations, and explore the generalized $\alpha$-attractor model using cosmological data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections and the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys, a new era in cosmology is unfolding. This study explores the synergies between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys to jointly constrain cosmological and gravitational-wave population parameters. We introduce CHIMERA, a novel code for gravitational-wave cosmology combining information from the population properties of compact binary mergers and galaxy catalogs. We study constraints for scenarios representative of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 and O5 observing runs, assuming to have a complete catalog of potential host galaxies with either spectroscopic or photometric redshift measurements. We find that a percent-level measurement of $H_0$ could be achieved with the best 100 binary black holes in O5 using a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. In this case, the intrinsic correlation that exists between $H_0$ and the binary black hole population mass scales is broken. Instead, by using a photometric catalog the accuracy is degraded up to a factor of $\sim\! 9$, leaving a significant correlation between $H_0$ and the mass scales that must be carefully modeled to avoid bias. Interestingly, we find that using spectroscopic redshift measurements in the O4 configuration yields a better constraint on $H_0$ compared to the O5 configuration with photometric measurements. In view of the wealth of gravitational-wave data that will be available in the future, we argue the importance of obtaining spectroscopic galaxy catalogs to maximize the scientific return of gravitational-wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Half-sided Translations and Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An AdS$_2$ black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath comes with a Hawking-like information paradox. The resolution of this paradox requires introducing an island for the bath after the Page time. Since the island region contains the black hole interior, the consistency of the island paradigm demands the failure of any interior reconstruction proposal that uses only the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon after the Page time. In this paper, we investigate the consistency of the island paradigm using the black hole interior reconstruction proposal due to Leutheusser and Liu. They argued that the operators in the interior of a black hole can be reconstructed by the half-sided translations of the operators outside the black hole horizon. However, in order to illustrate the island paradigm we need to modify the Leutheusser-Liu proposal by introducing the notion of the reduced half-sided translations. The reduced half-sided translations, unlike the half-sided translations, have non-trivial action only on the operators in the AdS$_2$ black hole region. As a result, the reconstructed interior operators are expressed only using the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon. We demonstrate the consistency of the island paradigm by showing that the reduced half-sided translations which successfully reconstruct the operators in the black hole interior before the Page time become trivial after the Page time, and hence fail to reconstruct the interior operators after the Page time.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial proof of the positivity of Quasi-Local mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13909v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

      <title>The Entropy of Dynamical Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole$-$valid to leading order for perturbations off of a stationary black hole background$-$in an arbitrary classical diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian theory of gravity in $n$ dimensions. In stationary eras, this formula agrees with the usual Noether charge formula, but in nonstationary eras, we obtain a nontrivial correction term. In general relativity, our formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole is $1/4$ of the horizon area plus a term involving the integral of the expansion of the null generators of the horizon, which we show is $1/4$ of the area of the apparent horizon to leading order. Our formula for entropy in a general theory of gravity obeys a "local physical process version" of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. For first order perturbations sourced by external matter that satisfies the null energy condition, our entropy obeys the second law of black hole thermodynamics. For vacuum perturbations, the second law is obeyed at leading order if and only if the "modified canonical energy flux" is positive (as is the case in general relativity but presumably would not hold in general theories). We obtain a general relationship between our formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole and a formula proposed independently by Dong and by Wall. We then consider the generalized second law in semiclassical gravity for first order perturbations of a stationary black hole. We show that the validity of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) on a Killing horizon is equivalent to the generalized second law using our notion of black hole entropy but using a modified notion of von Neumann entropy for matter. On the other hand, the generalized second law for the Dong-Wall entropy is equivalent to an integrated version of QNEC, using the unmodified von Neumann entropy for the entropy of matter.</description>

      <title>The minimal cosmological standard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and/or thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in close orbits as Gravitational Wave Sources: Formation Scenarios and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>
