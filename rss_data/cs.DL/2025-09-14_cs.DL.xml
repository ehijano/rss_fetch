      <title>Beginner's Charm: Beginner-Heavy Teams Are Associated With High Scientific Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teams now drive most scientific advances, yet the impact of absolute beginners -- authors with no prior publications -- remains understudied. Analyzing over 28 million articles published between 1971 and 2020 across disciplines and team sizes, we uncover a universal and previously undocumented pattern: teams with a higher fraction of beginners are systematically more disruptive and innovative. Their contributions are linked to distinct knowledge-integration behaviors, including drawing on broader and less canonical prior work and producing more atypical recombinations. Collaboration structure further shapes outcomes: disruption is high when beginners work with early-career colleagues or with co-authors who have disruptive track records. Although disruption and citations are negatively correlated overall, highly disruptive papers from beginner-heavy teams are highly cited. These findings reveal a "beginner's charm" in science, highlighting the underrecognized yet powerful value of beginner fractions in teams and suggesting actionable strategies for fostering a thriving ecosystem of innovation in science and technology.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Narrative Pattern Discovery from Biomedical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital libraries maintain extensive collections of knowledge and need to provide effective access paths for their users. For instance, PubPharm, the specialized information service for Pharmacy in Germany, provides and develops access paths to their underlying biomedical document collection. In brief, PubPharm supports traditional keyword-based search, search for chemical structures, as well as novel graph-based discovery workflows, e.g., listing or searching for interactions between different pharmaceutical entities. This paper introduces a new search functionality, called narrative pattern mining, allowing users to explore context-relevant entities and entity interactions. We performed interviews with five domain experts to verify the usefulness of our prototype.</description>
