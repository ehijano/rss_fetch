      <title>The effect of duty cycle on electron transmission through a graphene electrostatic barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated theoretically the transmission properties of Dirac Fermions tunneling through a periodically (sinusoidal and rectangular) driven electrostatic barrier in Monolayer graphene. For the time harmonic potential with moderate to high alpha (=amplitude/frequency) the central Floquet band is found to be almost cloaked for the Klein transmitted electron in contrast to electron at higher grazing incidences. As a time periodic drive, we mainly focused on the use of rectangular wave electric signal to modulate the transparency of the barrier. It is noted that the asymmetric Fano resonance, a characteristic feature of photon assisted tunneling, is more likely to occur for rectangular drive in contrast to the harmonic one. The height of the modulating potential is particularly responsible for the dressing effect of the barrier. The position and nature of the FR can be tailored by changing the height and frequency of the rectangular drive. Moreover, the duty cycle of the driving potential turns out to be an important controlling parameter for the transmission process. Thus, the rectangular modulation plays an important role for the occurrence and detection of the Fano resonances which is vital for the use of graphene nanostructure in the field of detectors, sensors, modulators etc. The present findings attempt for the first time, to realize the effect of duty cycle on the quantum interference in semiconductor nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantify the stability of Majorana qubits through Rabi beat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the stability of Majorana qubits (MQ) is crucial for the advancement of topological quantum computation. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the stability of MQs through their Rabi oscillations.Our approach involves coupling a fermionic state to the MQ and measuring the resulting Rabi oscillations induced by this coupling. This setup is feasible across a range of experimental platforms.We show that Rabi beats emerge when considering finite-size effects and inhomogeneous potentials. The beating frequency is directly related to the deviations caused by these factors, providing a quantitative method to assess the stability of Majorana qubits.Additionally, we investigate the impact of dissipation on MQ stability. We find that the beating patterns are unaffected by weak dissipation. More intriguingly, dissipation would weaken in an ideal MQ. This suggests that non-local qubits can effectively avoid certain types of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric magnetochiral anisotropy is a nonreciprocal phenomenon accessible via second harmonic transport in noncentrosymmetric, time-reversal invariant materials, in which the rectification of current, ${\bf I}$, can be controlled by an external magnetic field, ${\bf B}$. Quantum geometry, which characterizes the topology of Bloch electrons in a Hilbert space, provides a powerful description of the nonlinear dynamics in topological materials. Here, we demonstrate that the electric magnetochiral anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric polar media owes its existence to the quantum metric, arising from the spin-orbit coupling, and to large Born effective charges. In this context, the reciprocal magnetoresistance $\beta{\bf B}^2$ is modified to $R( I,P,B)=R_0[1+\beta B^2 + \gamma^{\pm}{\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})]$, where the chirality dependent $\gamma^{\pm}$ is determined by the quantum metric dipole and the polarization ${\bf P}$. We predict a universal scaling $\gamma^{\pm}(V)\sim V^{-5/2}$ which we verified by phase sensitive, second harmonic transport measurements on hydrothermally grown 2D tellurium films under applied gate voltage, $V$. The control of rectification by varying ${\bf I}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf B}$, and $V$, demonstrated in this work, opens up new avenues for the building of ultra-scaled CMOS circuits.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theory of Current-Induced Motion of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that appear in magnets with broken spatial inversion symmetry via competition between the (anti)ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a magnetic field. Their current-driven dynamics have been extensively studied aiming at spintronic applications. However, current-induced skyrmion motion exhibits diverse behaviors depending on various factors and conditions such as the type of skyrmion, driving mechanism, system geometry, direction of applied current, and type of the magnet. While this variety attracts enormous research interest of fundamental science and enriches their possibilities of technical applications, it is, at the same time, a source of difficulty and complexity that hinders their comprehensive understandings. In this article, we discuss fundamental and systematic theoretical descriptions of current-induced motion of skyrmions driven by the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. Specifically, we theoretically describe the behaviors of current-driven skyrmions depending on the factors and conditions mentioned above by means of analyses using the Thiele equation. Furthermore, the results of the analytical theory are visually demonstrated and quantitatively confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. In particular, we discuss dependence of the direction and velocity of motion on the type of skyrmion (Bloch type and Neel type) and its helicity, the system geometry (thin plate and nanotrack), the direction of applied current (length and width direction of the nanotrack) and its spin-polarization orientation, and the type of magnet (ferromagnet and antiferromagnet). The comprehensive theory provided by this article is expected to contribute significantly to research on the manipulation and control of magnetic skyrmions by electric currents for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Approaching the ultrastrong coupling regime between an Andreev level and a microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of an InAs nanowire weak link embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy of spin-degenerate and spin-orbit split Andreev bound states for the shorter and longer weak links, respectively. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which results in a measured coupling strength reaching 1.95 GHz to the Andreev level and 77 MHz to the Andreev spin. Our spectroscopic data are in good agreement with existing theoretical models and demonstrate ultrastrong coupling to the Andreev pair qubit with the coupling strength approaching the bare resonator and qubit frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling due to the cur- vature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this eff ective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We fi nd that this chiral-induced spin-orbit coupling (\chi-SOC), coupled to broken time-reversal symmetry, may provide a simple, yet rigorous way to describe the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Coherent detection of the oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have emerged as a novel technique for generating quasiparticle transport and band modulation in condensed matter systems. SAWs interact with adjacent materials through piezoelectric and strain fields, dragging carriers in the direction of wave propagation. Most studies on the acoustoelectric effect have focused on the collective directional motion of carriers, which generates a steady electric potential difference, while the oscillating component from dynamic spatial charge modulation has remained challenging to probe. In this work, we report the coherent detection of oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene. This is achieved through the coherent rectification of spatial-temporal charge oscillation with electromagnetic waves emitted by interdigital transducers. We systematically investigate the frequency and gate dependence of rectified signals and quantitatively probe the carrier redistribution dynamics driven by SAWs. The observation of oscillating acoustoelectric effect provides direct access to the dynamic spatial charge modulation induced by SAWs through transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Extended strange metal regime from superconducting puddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of mesoscale superconducting puddles in a metal, represented as dynamical impurities interacting with a finite number of electronic channels via Andreev and normal scattering. We identify conditions under which the collection of puddles make a $T$-linear contribution to the resistivity and a $T\ln(1/T)$ to the specific heat and thermopower. This behavior emerges in an intermediate temperature range that extends from an upper energy scale set by the renormalized charging energy of the puddles, and down to an exponentially small scale associated with a charge-Kondo crossover, provided that the number of electronic channels interacting with the puddle is large. The phenomenology of our model resembles the apparent extended strange metal regime observed in overdoped cuprates which exhibits $T$-linear resistivity at low $T$ over a finite range of doping. We also propose to engineer a strange metal from suitably designed superconducting grains in a metallic matrix.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Spiral Order from Strained Topological Heavy Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.</description>

      <title>Tuning electrochemical properties and thermal stability of YSZ mesoporous thin films for SOFC applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense and mesoporous 4% mol Yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films were deposited on amorphous silica substrates. The effects of the temperature on the mesostructure were analyzed, by applying different thermal treatments to the samples within the range of SOFC operation conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements rendered evidence of a single mechanism, consistent with grain boundary/surface oxide ion conduction. Our results show that the presence of the highly accessible porosity improves the superficial ionic conductivity, reducing the activation energy of the overall process. Density functional theory calculations on the (110) surface were performed to estimate the associated energy barriers. Our results suggest that ionic transport along the surface of accessible pores connected to the atmosphere could account for the observed reduction in activation energy.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Si spin qubit arrays with multilevel interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computation is contingent upon physical qubits with both low gate error rate and broad scalability. Silicon-based spins are a leading qubit platform, but demonstrations to date have not utilized fabrication processes capable of extending arrays in two dimensions while maintaining complete control of individual spins. Here, we implement an interconnect process, common in semiconductor manufacturing, with multiple back-end-of-line layers to show an extendable two-dimensional array of spins with fully controllable nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. In a device using three interconnect layers, we encode exchange-only qubits and achieve average single-qubit gate fidelities consistent with single-layer devices, including fidelities greater than 99.9%, as measured by blind randomized benchmarking. Moreover, with spin connectivity in two dimensions, we show that both linear and right-angle exchange-only qubits with high performance can be formed, enabling qubit array reconfigurability in the presence of defects. This extendable device platform demonstrates that industrial manufacturing techniques can be leveraged for scalable spin qubit technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By evidencing the holonomic and dynamical contributions in scattering problems, we develop a method for calculating the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. To validate our approach, we investigate the spin-resolved scattering of electrons along a wire subjected to a spatially varying magnetic (Zeeman) field. In particular, we show that in the high-energy limit, the transmission matrix aligns with the holonomy, reducing to a pure topological form. We illustrate the method by examining several scenarios with varied in-plane magnetic field profiles. For instance, our results indicate the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, with implications for use in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent dissipation effects in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation fundamentally alters quantum transport in Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate unique transport signatures in dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, which provide a powerful platform for exploring the competition between dissipation and topological protection. We incorporate dissipation effects by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead at the junction to an electron reservoir, and describe its effects using an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian within the Lindblad formalism. Non-Hermiticity introduces finite lifetimes to the helical Andreev bound states in the junction, with imaginary energy components that depend on the quasiparticle incidence angle, while Klein tunneling remains robust for normal incidence. Unlike `ordinary' non-Hermitian Josephson junctions, this system exhibits no Josephson gaps or forbidden regions, preserving topological protection. In the fully non-Hermitian regime, a tunable line of zero-energy states emerges, bounded by exceptional-like points with divergent supercurrents. Our results reveal how dissipation reshapes superconducting transport in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Broadband photoresponse enhancement by band engineering in Sb-doped MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials have attracted considerable attention for their potential in broadband and fast photoresponse, particularly in the infrared regime. However, the high carrier concentration in these systems often leads to rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers, limiting the photoresponsivity. Here, we demonstrate that Sb doping in MnBi2Te4 effectively reduces carrier concentration and suppresses electron-hole recombination, thereby significantly improving the optoelectronic performance across the visible to mid-infrared spectra. The optimally doped Mn(Bi0.82Sb0.18)2Te4 photodetector achieves a responsivity of 3.02 mA W-1 with a response time of 18.5 {\mu}s at 1550 nm, and 0.795 mA W-1 with a response time of 9.0 {\mu}s at 4 {\mu}m. These values represent nearly two orders of magnitude improvement compared to undoped MnBi2Te4. Our results highlight band engineering as an effective strategy to enhance the infrared performance of topological material-based photodetectors, opening new avenues for high-sensitivity infrared detection.</description>

      <title>Unexpected large electrostatic gating by pyroelectric charge accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyroelectricity refers to the accumulation of charges due to changes in the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials when subjected to temperature variations. Typically, these pyroelectric charges are considered unstable and dissipate quickly through interactions with the external environment. Consequently, the pyroelectric effect has been largely overlooked in ferroelectric field-effect transistors. In this work, we leverage the van der Waals interface of hBN to achieve a substantial and long-term electrostatic gating effect in graphene devices via the pyroelectric properties of a ferroelectric LiNbO3 substrate. Upon cooling, the polarization change in LiNbO3 induces high doping concentrations up to 1013 cm-2 in the adjacent graphene. Through a combination of transport measurements and non-contact techniques, we demonstrate that the pyroelectric charge accumulation, as well as its enhancement in electric fields, are responsible for this unexpectedly high doping level. Our findings introduce a novel mechanism for voltage-free electrostatic gating control with long retention.</description>

      <title>Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Quantum Kirigamis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state - a dark state - with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the long-wavelength and long-time dynamics of the fermion densities and analyze them numerically. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. We also estimate the minimum system sizes required to observe this instability in finite systems. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization in 2D topological quantum random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical localization of discrete time evolution of topological split-step quantum random walk (QRW) on a single-site defect starting from a uniform distribution. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the high localization probability regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions contain two or more pairs of trapped states, forming near a lattice defect. By investigating the spectral properties of the discrete-time evolution operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial uniformly distributed state, thus offering a simple interpretation of the localization effect. As this localization scheme could be interpreted as a variation of spatial quantum search algorithm, we compare the localization probability and time with other types of two-dimensional quantum walks that do not have topological phases and realize localization time scaling similar to Grover's algorithm. Finally we show that mechanism of localization we identified is robust against the influence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Relaxation with THz Attempt Frequency in the 1/3-Fire, 2/3-Ice Ferrimagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets in which half the spins are disordered and half ordered, so-called half-fire, half-ice state, have been advanced theoretically as a route towards realizing exotic magnetic ground states. Here we demonstrate novel single-spin resonance in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice material. Using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz we find a Debye-like resonance with Orbach relaxation temperature dependence, yielding an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. These quantities strongly suggest single-spin relaxation among paramagnetic Sm spins where the flipping field is provided by the FM-ordered Mn spins at domain boundaries, a direct outcome of the 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice state.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization and Force Error Correction of Neuroevolution Potential for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Wurtzite GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.</description>
