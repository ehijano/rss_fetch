      <title>Competing Social Contagions with Opinion Dependent Infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation (maliciously spread false information) in online social networks has become an important problem in today's society. Disinformation's spread is facilitated by the fact that individuals often accept false information based on cognitive biases which predispose them to believe information that they have heard repeatedly or that aligns with their beliefs. Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the transient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the revival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread opinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to the eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.</description>

      <title>Diversity and stylization of the contemporary user-generated visual arts in the complexity-entropy plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of computational and numerical methods in recent times has provided new avenues for analyzing art historiographical narratives and tracing the evolution of art styles therein. Here, we investigate an evolutionary process underpinning the emergence and stylization of contemporary user-generated visual art styles using the complexity-entropy (C-H) plane, which quantifies local structures in paintings. Informatizing 149,780 images curated in DeviantArt and Behance platforms from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the relationship between local information of the C-H space and multi-level image features generated by a deep neural network and a feature extraction algorithm. The results reveal significant statistical relationships between the C-H information of visual artistic styles and the dissimilarities of the multi-level image features over time within groups of artworks. By disclosing a particular C-H region where the diversity of image representations is noticeably manifested, our analyses reveal an empirical condition of emerging styles that are both novel in the C-H plane and characterized by greater stylistic diversity. Our research shows that visual art analyses combined with physics-inspired methodologies and machine learning, can provide macroscopic insights into quantitatively mapping relevant characteristics of an evolutionary process underpinning the creative stylization of uncharted visual arts of given groups and time.</description>

      <title>Preserving system activity while controlling epidemic spreading in adaptive temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human behaviour strongly influences the spread of infectious diseases: understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and adaptive behaviours is essential to improve response strategies to epidemics, with the goal of containing the epidemic while preserving a sufficient level of operativeness in the population. Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.</description>
