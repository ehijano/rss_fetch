      <title>Delamination Detection in Layered Waveguides using Ostrovsky Wave Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the scattering of Ostrovsky wave packets, generated from an incident solitary wave, in a two layered waveguide with a delamination in the centre and soft (imperfect) bonding either side of the centre. The layers of the waveguide are assumed to consist of different materials, and the strains are described by a system of coupled Boussinesq equations. A semi-analytical approach consisting of matched asymptotic multiple-scale expansions is applied, leading to Ostrovsky equations in soft bonded regions and Korteweg-de Vries equations in the delaminated region. This semi-analytical method has good agreement with direct numerical simulations, validating the approach.
  In the delaminated regions, Ostrovsky wave packets evolve into a train of solitary waves, which subsequently evolve into Ostrovsky wave packets in the second bonded region. Analysis of the phase shift in the wave packet, introduced from the delaminated region, allows us to predict both the position and the length of the delamination; the first time this has been achieved using nonlinear waves. These results motivate experiments to validate the theoretical results, with the aim of creating a tool to monitor the integrity of layered structures.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the propagation of ON-OFF signals by dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of ON-OFF signals with dispersive waves is examined in this study. An integral-form exact solution for a simple ON-OFF switching event is derived, which holds for any dispersion relation. The integral can be exactly calculated for two types of dispersion relations. Further, the analysis of these solutions shows that the ON-OFF signal propagates with the group velocity and that the boundary thickness of the signal increases with time, typically at a rate proportional to the square root of time, owing to dispersion. Additionally, an approximate solution for a general dispersion relation is derived, and a for a higher-complexity ON-OFF switching pattern is constructed.</description>
