      <title>Scott Spectral Gaps are Bounded for Linear Orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any $\Pi_\alpha$ sentence of the infinitary logic $L_{\omega_1 \omega}$ extending the theory of linear orderings has a model with a $\Pi_{\alpha+4}$ Scott sentence and hence of Scott rank at most $\alpha+3$. In other words, the gap between the complexity of the theory and the complexity of the simplest model is always bounded by $4$. This contrasts the situation with general structures where for any $\alpha$ there is a $\Pi_2$ sentence all of whose models have Scott rank $\alpha$. We also give new lower bounds, though there remains a small gap between our lower and upper bounds: For most (but not all) $\alpha$, we construct a $\Pi_\alpha$ sentence extending the theory of linear orderings such that no models have a $\Sigma_{\alpha+2}$ Scott sentence and hence no models have Scott rank less than or equal to $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On ideals related to Laver and Miller trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the ideals $m^0(\mathcal{I})$ and $\ell^0(\mathcal{I})$, ideals generated by the $\mathcal{I}$-positive Miller trees and $\mathcal{I}$-positive Laver trees, respectively. We investigate in which cases these ideals have cofinality larger than $\mathfrak{c}$ and we calculate some cardinal invariants closely related to these ideals.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) heirarchy. This is a Spoiler-Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that the 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's heirarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $6$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (ibid.), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $O(1)$ variables and $O(1)$ quantifier depth.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Taking Bi-Intuitionistic Logic First-Order: A Proof-Theoretic Investigation via Polytree Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that extending the Hilbert axiomatic system for first-order intuitionistic logic with an exclusion operator, that is dual to implication, collapses the domains of models into a constant domain. This makes it an interesting problem to find a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with non-constant domains that is also conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. We solve this problem by presenting the first sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with increasing domains. We formalize our proof system as a polytree sequent calculus (a notational variant of nested sequents), and prove that it enjoys cut-elimination and is conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. A key feature of our calculus is an explicit eigenvariable context, which allows us to control precisely the scope of free variables in a polytree structure. Semantically this context can be seen as encoding a notion of Scott's existence predicate for intuitionistic logic. This turns out to be crucial to avoid the collapse of domains and to prove the completeness of our proof system. The explicit consideration of the variable context in a formula sheds light on a previously overlooked dependency between the residuation principle and the existence predicate in the first-order setting, which may help to explain the difficulty in designing a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>Unifying Sequent Systems for G\"odel-L\"ob Provability Logic via Syntactic Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the inter-translatability of proofs between the most prominent sequent-based formalisms for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. In particular, we consider Sambin and Valentini's sequent system GLseq, Shamkanov's non-wellfounded and cyclic sequent systems GL$\infty$ and GLcirc, Poggiolesi's tree-hypersequent system CSGL, and Negri's labeled sequent system G3GL. Shamkanov provided proof-theoretic correspondences between GLseq, GL$\infty$, and GLcirc, and Gor\'e and Ramanayake showed how to transform proofs between CSGL and G3GL, however, the exact nature of proof transformations between the former three systems and the latter two systems has remained an open problem. We solve this open problem by showing how to restructure tree-hypersequent proofs into an end-active form and introduce a novel linearization technique that transforms such proofs into linear nested sequent proofs. As a result, we obtain a new proof-theoretic tool for extracting linear nested sequent systems from tree-hypersequent systems, which yields the first cut-free linear nested sequent calculus LNGL for G\"odel-L\"ob provability logic. We show how to transform proofs in LNGL into a certain normal form, where proofs repeat in stages of modal and local rule applications, and which are translatable into GLseq and G3GL proofs. These new syntactic transformations, together with those mentioned above, establish full proof-theoretic correspondences between GLseq, GL$\infty$, GLcirc, CSGL, G3GL, and LNGL while also giving (to the best of the author's knowledge) the first constructive proof mappings between structural (viz. labeled, tree-hypersequent, and linear nested sequent) systems and a cyclic sequent system.</description>
