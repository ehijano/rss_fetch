      <title>Algorithmic Construction of Real Hyperfields from Minimal Axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real hyperfields, focusing in particular on those that are finite with cyclic positive cones. All real hyperfields have characteristic zero, although they can still be classified using the C-characteristic, an invariant that captures essential structural information. We present an algorithm to determine all such hyperfields up to isomorphism and compute their C-characteristic. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that the set of axioms used is minimal. We develop and implement this algorithm in software, enabling a complete classification of finite real hyperfields with cyclic positive cones of order up to 15, as well as identification of the C-characteristic that occur in such hyperfields of order up to 17. Restricting attention to finite hyperfields of cyclic positive cones enables substantial simplification of the algorithm, thereby enhancing its computational efficiency and allowing for the rapid generation of hyperfields of large order. Using a criterion that allows us to determine whether a given finite real hyperfield is a Krasner quotient hyperfield, we obtain many new examples of hyperfields that do not arise from Krasner's quotient construction.</description>

      <title>Sums of two nilpotent quaternionic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{Q}$ be a quaternion division algebra over a field, and $n \geq 2$ be an integer. In a recent article, de La Cruz et al have proved that every $n$-by-$n$ matrix with entries in $\mathcal{Q}$ and pure quaternionic trace is the sum of three nilpotent matrices, and they have shown that some are not the sum of two nilpotent matrices.
  Here, we give a simple characterization of the square matrices with entries in $\mathcal{Q}$ that are the sum of two nilpotent ones. When $n \geq 3$, the special cases involve the scalar matrices and their perturbations by rank $1$ matrices, as well as the very special case of $3$-by-$3$ unispectral diagonalisable matrices.</description>

      <title>Good Integers: A Comprehensive Review with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nonzero coprime integers $a$ and $b$, a positive integer $\ell$ is said to be \emph{good with respect to $a$ and $b$} if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\ell$ divides $a^{k} + b^{k}$. The concept of good integers has been the subject of continuous investigation since the 1990s due to their elegant number-theoretic properties and their significant applications in various areas, particularly in coding theory. This paper provides a comprehensive review of good integers, emphasizing both their theoretical foundations and their practical implications. We first revisit the fundamental number-theoretic properties of good integers and present their characterizations in a systematic manner. The exposition is enriched with well-structured algorithms and illustrative diagrams that facilitate their computation and classification. Subsequently, we explore applications of good integers in the study of algebraic coding theory. In particular, their roles in the characterization, construction, and enumeration of self-dual cyclic codes and complementary dual cyclic codes are discussed in detail. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the theory. This review not only consolidates existing results but also highlights the unifying role of good integers in bridging number theory and coding theory.</description>

      <title>Homological Bounds of Gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the homological bounds of gentle algebras, i.e., the upper bounds for the sum of the projective and injective dimensions of indecomposable modules over gentle algebras. We provide conditions under which this sum is strictly less than twice the global dimension, and as an application, we give a characterization of quasi-tilted gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>Tridendriform and dendriform Zeta Values from Schroeder trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To build new generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values, we define new spaces of formal series and formal integrals. We show that they are tridendriform and dendriform algebras. This allows us to reinterpret the fact that Multiple Zeta Values are algebra morphisms for shuffles of words in terms of finer tridendriform and dendriform structures. Applying universal properties of Schroeder trees we obtain generalisations of Multiple Zeta Values that are algebra morphisms for associative products. Hence we find new properties of Arborified Zeta Values and state how this enables the computation of some Shintani Zeta Values.</description>

Abstract: For a regular normal element in an arbitrary ring, we study the category of its module factorizations. The cokernel functor relates module factorizations with Gorenstein projective components to Gorenstein projective modules over the quotient ring. The results are vast extensions of Eisenbud's matrix factorization theorem.</description>

      <title>Finitary conditions for graph products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph products of monoids provide a common framework for free products and direct products. Trace monoids are graph products of finitely generated free monoids. We investigate the interaction of certain finitary conditions with graph products. Specifically, we examine the conditions of being weakly left noetherian (that is, every left ideal is finitely generated) and weakly left coherent (that is, every finitely generated left ideal has a finite presentation) and the related conditions of the ascending chain condition on principal left ideals, being left ideal Howson, and being finitely left equated. All of these conditions, and others, are preserved under retract; as a consequence, if a graph product has such a property, then so do all the constituent monoids. We show that the converse is also true for all the conditions listed except that of being weakly left noetherian. In the latter case we precisely determine the graph products of monoids which are weakly left noetherian.</description>

  The paper is devoted to the classification problem of associative algebras over any base field. We provide a list of three-dimensional associative algebras with canonical representatives of the isomorphism classes over a base field of the characteristic is not two and three. Comparisons of our lists with the most recent lists over the field of complex number in dimensions three, with some comments, are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin by reviewing the definition of 3-Lie algebras and the fundamental concepts of matched pairs. Subsequently, we introduce the representation theory of matched pairs and define the semidirect product. Building on this foundation, we define the low-dimensional cohomology groups of matched pairs. In addition, we explore the infinitesimal deformations and abelian extensions of matched pairs. Finally, we examine the inducibility of automorphisms of matched pairs and present related results through the Wells exact sequence.</description>

      <title>Decompositions into a direct sum of projective and stable submodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A module $M$ is {called} stable if it has no nonzero projective direct summand. For a ring $ R $, we study conditions under which $R$-modules from certain classes decompose as a direct sum of a projective submodule and a stable submodule. Over {an arbitrary} ring, modules of finite uniform dimension or finite hollow dimension can be decomposed as a direct sum of a projective submodule and a stable submodule. By using the Auslander-Bridger transpose of finitely presented modules, we prove that every finitely presented right $R$-module over a left semihereditary ring $R$ has such a decomposition. Our main focus in this article is to give examples where such a decomposition fails. We give some ring examples over which there exists an infinitely generated or finitely generated or finitely presented module where such a decomposition fails. Our main example is a cyclically presented module $M$ over a commutative ring such that~$M$ has no such decomposition and $M$ is not projectively equivalent to a stable module.</description>

      <title>Brick-splitting Torsion Pairs and Left Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of brick-splitting torsion pairs as a modern analogue and generalization of the classical notion of splitting torsion pairs. A torsion pair is called brick-splitting if any given brick is either torsion or torsion-free with respect to that torsion pair. After giving some properties of these pairs, we fully characterize them in terms of some lattice-theoretical properties, including left modularity. This leads to the notion of brick-directed algebras, which are those for which there does not exist any cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms between bricks. This class of algebras is a novel generalization of representation-directed algebras. We show that brick-directed algebras have many interesting properties and give several characterizations of them. In particular, we prove that a brick-finite algebra is brick-directed if and only if the lattice of torsion classes is left modular (or equivalently, extremal). We also give a characterization of brick-directed algebras in terms of their wall-and-chamber structure, as well as of a certain Newton polytope associated to them. Moreover, we introduce an explicit construction of an abundance of brick-directed algebras, both of the tame and wild representation types.</description>

      <title>On Banach subalgebras of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ consisting of lacunary Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ be the set of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}$ (where $a_n\in\mathbb{C}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$) that converge at each $s$ in $\mathbb{C}_0=\{s\in \mathbb{C}:\text{Re}(s)&gt;0\}$, such that $\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup_{s\in\mathbb{C}_0}|f(s)|&lt;\infty$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ is a Banach algebra with pointwise operations and the supremum norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$, and has been studied in earlier works. The article introduces a new family of Banach subalgebras $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$. For $S\subset\mathbb{N}$, let $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ be the set of all elements $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}\in \mathscr{H}^\infty$ such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}\setminus S$, we have $a_n=0$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is a unital Banach subalgebra of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ with the supremum norm if and only if $S$ is a multiplicative subsemigroup of $\mathbb{N}$ containing $1$. It is shown that for such $S$, $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is the multiplier algebra of $\mathscr{H}^2_S$, where $\mathscr{H}^2_S$ is the Hilbert space of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n\in S} a_nn^{-s}$ such that $\|f\|_2:=(\sum_{n\in S} |a_n|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;\infty$. A characterisation of the group of units in $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is also given, by showing an analogue of the Wiener $1/f$ theorem for $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$. If $S$ has a set of generators allowing a unique representation of each element of $S$, then it is shown that the Bass stable rank of $\mathscr{H}^\infty_S$ is infinite.</description>
