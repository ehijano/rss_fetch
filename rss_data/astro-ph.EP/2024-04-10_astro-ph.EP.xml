      <title>Extinction values towards embedded planets in protoplanetary disks estimated from hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming new coronographs with deeper contrast limits, together with planned and current high-contrast imaging campaigns will push the detectability limit of protoplanets. These planet-hunting campaigns present a new opportunity to characterize protoplanets and their surrounding environments. However, there are clear uncertainties as to what are the extinction levels at different regions of protoplanetary disks, which will impede our ability to characterize young planets. A correct understanding of the expected extinction together with multiple photometric observations will lead to constraints on the extinction levels, dust growth, disk evolution and protoplanetary accretion rates. In this work, we used hydrodynamic simulations and protoplanetary disk observational constraints obtained from both dust and gas emission to explore the expected extinction maps for continuum filters associated with strong hydrogen lines as tracers of accretion and key broadband photometric filters. We provide a scaling relationship for the extinction as a function of planetary separation and disk mass for three different gas giant masses. We also report values for a subset of disks of interest targetted by multiple imaging campaigns. The described values will be useful for the optimal design of future planet-hunting surveys and for giving context to non-detections in protoplanetary disks and the observed fluxes of point sources along with the birth conditions of protoplanets.</description>

      <title>Overstability of the 2:1 mean motion resonance: Exploring disc parameters with hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant planetary migration in protoplanetary discs can lead to an interplay between the resonant interaction of planets and their disc torques called overstability. While theoretical predictions and N-body simulations hinted at its existence, there was no conclusive evidence until hydrodynamical simulations were performed.
  Our primary purpose is to find a hydrodynamic setup that induces overstability in a planetary system with two moderate-mass planets in a first-order 2:1 mean motion resonance. We also aim to analyse the impact of key disc parameters, namely the viscosity, surface density, and aspect ratio, on the occurrence of overstability in this planetary system when the masses of the planets are kept constant.
  We performed 2D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of two planets, with masses of 5 and 10 $M_{\oplus}$, in a 2:1 resonance. Upon identifying the fiducial model in which the system exhibits overstability, we performed simulations with different disc parameters to explore the effects of the disc on the overstability of the system.
  We observe an overstable planetary system in our hydrodynamic simulations. In the parameter study, we note that overstability occurs in discs characterised by low surface density and low viscosity. Increasing the surface density reduces the probability of overstability within the system. A limit cycle was observed in a specific viscous model with $\alpha_{\nu} = 10^{-3}$. In almost all our models, planets create partial gaps in the disc, which affects both the migration timescale and structure of the planetary system.
  We demonstrate the existence of overstability using hydrodynamic simulations but find deviations from the analytic approximation and show that the main contribution to this deviation can be attributed to dynamic gap opening.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Metallicity dependence of dust growth in a protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of planet formation, growth from micron-sized grains to kilometer-sized planetesimals is a crucial question. Since the dust growth rate depends on the amount of dust, realizing planet formation scenarios based on dust growth is challenging in environments with low metallicity, i.e. less dust. We investigate dust growth during disk evolution, particularly focusing on the relationship with metallicity. We perform two-dimensional thin-disk hydrodynamic simulations to track the disk evolution over 300 kyr from its formation. The dust motion is solved separately from the gas motion, with its distribution changing due to drag forces from the gas. Dust size growth is also accounted for, with the magnitude of the drag force varying according to the dust size. We employ three models with metallicities of 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, i.e. dust-to-gas mass ratios of 10$^{-2}$, 10$^{-3}$, and 10$^{-4}$, respectively. In the disks with the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the dust radii reach cm sizes, consistent with estimations from the dust growth timescale. Conversely, for the metallicity of 0.01 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the maximum dust size is only 10$^{-2}$ cm, with almost no growth observed across the entire disk scale ($\sim$100 au). At the metallicities $\ge0.1$ ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$, the decoupling between grown dust and gas leads to non-uniform dust-to-gas mass ratios. However, deviations from the canonical value of this ratio have no impact on the gravitational instability of the disk. The formation of dust rings is confirmed in the innermost part of the disk ($\sim$10--30 au). The dust rings where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is enhanced, and the Stokes number reaches $\sim$0.1, are suitable environments for the streaming instability. We conjecture that planetesimal formation occurs through the streaming instability in these dust rings.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation by Gas-Assisted Accretion of Small Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm $\le$ Rs $\le$ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 $\le$ Mp $\le$ 20 Earth masses (Me) and orbit within 10 AU of a solar-mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. Maximum efficiencies of 1 $\le$ Rs $\le$ 100 cm particles are generally $\lesssim$ 10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet's orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp $\le$ 1 Me and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to Mp^(2/3). The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt $\lesssim$ 1e-5 Mearth/yr. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70-100 and total mass of 0.05-0.06 Msun, solids' accretion falls below 1e-6 Mearth/yr after 1-1.5 million years (Myr). The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of approximately 0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of approximately 3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3-7 Me require that approximately 90-150 Me of solids cross the planet's orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times the Earth mass, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. Peak luminosities during the epoch of solids' accretion range from $\approx$ 1e-7 to $\approx$ 1e-6 times the solar luminosity.</description>

      <title>Chondrule Destruction via Dust Collisions in Shock Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading candidate for the heating source of chondrules and igneous rims is shock waves. This mechanism generates high relative velocities between chondrules and dust particles. We have investigated the possibility of the chondrule destruction in collisions with dust particles behind a shock wave using a semianalytical treatment. We find that the chondrules are destroyed during melting in collisions. We derive the conditions for the destruction of chondrules and show that the typical size of the observed chondrules satisfies the condition. We suggest that the chondrule formation and rim accretion are different events if they are heated by shock waves.</description>

      <title>Radial and vertical constraints on the icy origin of H$_{2}$CO in the HD 163296 Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$_2$CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H$_2$CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of several ortho- and para-H$_2$CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H$_2$CO, as well as disk-averaged values of $N_{\mathrm{T}}\sim4\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, $T_{\mathrm{ex}}\sim20$ K, and $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of $z/r\sim0.1$. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$ with radius, but still consistent with $3.0$ among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of $N_{\mathrm{T}}$ in the outer disk, and low $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H$_2$CO in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The AstraLux-TESS high-spatial resolution imaging survey. Search for stellar companions of 215 planet candidates from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chance-aligned sources or blended companions can cause false positives in planetary transit detections or simply bias the determination of the candidate properties. In the era of high-precision space-based photometers, the need for high-spatial resolution images has demonstrated to be critical for validating and confirming transit signals. This already applied to the Kepler mission, it is now applicable to the TESS survey and will be critical for PLATO. We present the results of the AstraLux-TESS survey, a catalog of high-spatial resolution images obtained with the AstraLux instrument (Calar Alto) in the context of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. We use the lucky-imaging technique to obtain high-spatial resolution images from planet candidate hosts included mostly in two relevant regimes: exoplanet candidates belonging to the level-one requirement of the TESS mission (planets with radii $R&lt;4~R_{\oplus}$), and candidates around intermediate-mass stars. Among the 185 planet host candidate stars observed, we found 13 (7%) to be accompanied by additional sources within 2.2 arcsec separation. Among them, six are not associated to sources in the Gaia DR3 catalog, thus contaminating the TESS light curve. We provide upper limits and probabilities to the possible existence of field contaminants through the sensitivity limits of our images. Among the isolated hosts, we can discard hazardous companions (bright enough to mimic a planetary transit signals) for all their planets. The results from this catalog are key for the statistical validation of small planets (prime targets of the TESS mission) and planets around intermediate-mass stars in the main-sequence. These two populations of planets are hard to confirm with the radial velocity technique. Our results also demonstrate the importance of this type of follow-up observations for future transit missions like PLATO, even in the Gaia era.</description>

      <title>Does the Earth's rotation speed really tend to accelerate for a long time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently published studies suggested that the difference between Universal and Coordinated Time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in a few years, making it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC scale for the first time in its history. Based on the latest UT1 series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and its prediction, it was shown that the tendency to acceleration of the Earth's rotation observed over past four years most likely will return to the deceleration, which is the usual behavior of the Earth rotational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Compact Sub-Saturn Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration -- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets -- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures. Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b ($\lambda=1\pm 48\,^{\circ}$) and TOI-5398 b ($\lambda=-24^{+14}_{-13} \,^{\circ}$). Both are spin-orbit aligned, joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment. Our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase through violent dynamical interactions inherent to eccentric migration, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136: Microlensing events with prominent orbital effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a project to reexamine microlensing data gathered from high-cadence surveys. The aim of the project is to reinvestigate lensing events with light curves exhibiting intricate anomaly features associated with caustics, yet lacking prior proposed models to explain these features. Through detailed reanalyses considering higher-order effects, we identify that accounting for orbital motions of lenses is vital in accurately explaining the anomaly features observed in the light curves of the lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136. We estimate the masses and distances to the lenses by conducting Bayesian analyses using the lensing parameters of the newly found lensing solutions. From these analyses, we identify that the lenses of the events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971 and MOA-2023-BLG-065 are binaries composed of M dwarfs, while the lens of OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 is likely to be a binary composed of an early K-dwarf primary and a late M-dwarf companion. For all lensing events, the probability of the lens residing in the bulge is considerably higher than that of it being located in the disk.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Atmospheric Dispersion Correction of the Gemini Planet Imager: residual dispersion above design requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) corrects the chromatic dispersion caused by differential atmospheric refraction (DAR), making it an important optic for exoplanet observation. Despite requiring less than 5 mas of residual DAR to avoid potentially affecting the coronagraph, the GPI ADC averages $\sim7$ and $\sim11$ mas of residual DAR in $H$ and $J$ band respectively. We analyzed GPI data in those bands to find explanations for the underperformance. We found the model GPI uses to predict DAR underestimates humidity's impact on incident DAR, causing on average a 0.54 mas increase in $H$ band residual DAR. Additionally, the GPI ADC consistently undercorrects in $H$ band by about 7 mas, causing almost all the $H$ band residual DAR. $J$ band does not have such an offset. Perpendicular dispersion induced by the GPI ADC, potentially from a misalignment in the prisms' relative orientation, causes 86% of the residual DAR in $J$ band. Correcting these issues could reduce residual DAR, thereby improving exoplanet detection. We also made a new approximation for the index of refraction of air from 0.7 microns to 1.36 microns that more accurately accounts for the effects of humidity.</description>

Abstract: The challenge of inconsistent results from different data pipelines, even when starting from identical data, is a recognized concern in exoplanetary science. As we transition into the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era and prepare for the ARIEL space mission, addressing this issue becomes paramount because of its implications on our understanding of exoplanets. Although comparing pipeline results for individual exoplanets has become more common, this study is the first to compare pipeline results at the catalogue level. We present a comprehensive framework to statistically compare the outcomes of data analysis reduction on a population of exoplanets and we leverage the large number of observations conducted using the same instrument configured with HST-WFC3. We employ three independent pipelines: Iraclis, EXCALIBUR, and CASCADe. Our combined findings reveal that these pipelines, despite starting from the same data and planet system parameters, yield substantially different spectra in some cases. However, the most significant manifestations of pipeline differences are observed in the compositional trends of the resulting exoplanet catalogues. We conclude that pipeline-induced differences lead to biases in the retrieved information, which are not reflected in the retrieved uncertainties. Our findings underscore the critical need to confront these pipeline differences to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and reliability of results in exoplanetary research. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for population-level bias that pipelines may inject, which could compromise our understanding of exoplanets as a class of objects.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on The Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by using a Galactic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from Suzuki et al. (2016) with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bandpasses for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>

      <title>MRI turbulence in vertically stratified accretion discs at large magnetic Prandtl numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, has spawned a plethora of global numerical relativity simulations. These simulations are often ideal (with dissipation determined by the grid) and/or axisymmetric (invoking ad hoc mean-field dynamos). However, binary neutron star mergers (similar to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei inner discs) are characterised by large magnetic Prandtl numbers, $\rm Pm$, (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity). $\rm Pm$ is a key parameter determining dynamo action and dissipation but it is ill-defined (and likely of order unity) in ideal simulations. To bridge this gap, we investigate the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and associated dynamo at large magnetic Prandtl numbers using fully compressible, three-dimensional, vertically stratified, isothermal simulations of a local patch of a disc. We find that, within the bulk of the disc ($z\lesssim2H$, where $H$ is the scale-height), the turbulent intensity (parameterized by the stress-to-thermal-pressure ratio $\alpha$), and the saturated magnetic field energy density, $E_\text{mag}$, produced by the MRI dynamo, both scale as a power with Pm at moderate Pm ($4\lesssim \text{Pm} \lesssim 32$): $E_\text{mag} \sim \text{Pm}^{0.74}$ and $\alpha \sim \text{Pm}^{0.71}$, respectively. At larger Pm ($\gtrsim 32$) we find deviations from power-law scaling and the onset of a plateau. Compared to our recent unstratified study, this scaling with Pm becomes weaker further away from the disc mid-plane, where the Parker instability dominates. We perform a thorough spectral analysis to understand the underlying dynamics of small-scale MRI-driven turbulence in the mid-plane and of large-scale Parker-unstable structures in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front (I-front) of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model. We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>PHL 5038AB: Is the brown dwarf causing pollution of its white dwarf host star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new results on PHL 5038AB, a widely separated binary system composed of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf, refining the white and brown dwarf parameters and determining the binary separation to be $66^{+12}_{-24}$~AU. New spectra of the white dwarf show calcium absorption lines suggesting the hydrogen-rich atmosphere is weakly polluted, inferring the presence of planetesimals in the system, which we determine are in an S-type orbit around the white dwarf in orbits closer than 17-32 AU. We do not detect any infrared excess that would indicate the presence of a disc, suggesting all dust present has either been totally accreted or is optically thin. In this system, we suggest the metal pollution in the white dwarf atmosphere can be directly attributed to the presence of the brown dwarf companion disrupting the orbits of planetesimals within the system.</description>
