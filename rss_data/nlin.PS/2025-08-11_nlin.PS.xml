      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Kink Configurations: From Small to Large Kink Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the scattering dynamics of kinks within a nonlinear system governed by a parameterized potential $U_\lambda(\chi)$, examining the distinct behaviors of small and large kinks across a range of $\lambda$ values and initial velocities. For small kinks, we investigate the critical velocity for separation, the influence of vibrational modes, resonance phenomena, and the conditions under which large kinks emerge from collisions. Our findings reveal that the critical velocity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the parameter $\lambda$, reflecting the evolving stability of small kinks, while the decreasing frequency of vibrational modes with increasing $\lambda$ diminishes resonance effects, leading to simpler scattering dynamics at higher $\lambda$. The formation of large kinks from small kink collisions is favored at lower $\lambda$, where the mass difference between small and large kinks is reduced. Conversely, large kink scattering consistently results in the production of small kinks, with the number of small kink pairs growing as both $\lambda$ and initial velocity increase, a process driven by energy transfer from the translational modes of large kinks to the potential energy required for small kink creation. The absence of vibrational modes in large kinks contrasts with their presence in small kinks, where such modes give rise to complex phenomena like bion formation and resonance. These results underscore the pivotal role of $\lambda$ in shaping kink interactions and offer valuable insights into the dynamics of topological defects in nonlinear systems, with potential implications for understanding similar phenomena in condensed matter physics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Phase-field model of alloy solidification far from chemical equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>
