      <title>Charge transport and mode transition in dual-energy electron beam diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter uncovers five distinct charge transport modes and their transitions in dual-energy electron beam diodes. We, via fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, establish that the specific mode (e.g., space charge oscillations) and the current transport characteristics are essentially governed by the interplay between the electron beam energy and injected current density. A more generalized analysis is conducted for n-component electron beams, and a theoretical piecewise function is proposed, which agrees well with the PIC results under designed conditions. The discovery provides a mechanistic picture of multiple electron beam transport in diodes, paving the way for novel designs of high-performance modern vacuum electronic devices.</description>

      <title>$T_i/T_e$ Dependence of Core Turbulence and Transport in DIII-D QH-Mode Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio ($T_i/T_e$) on microturbulence driven transport in Quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) plasmas in the DIII-D tokamak. Utilizing the Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) and the QH-mode equilibrium, we perform linear and nonlinear simulations to analyze transport properties and instability dynamics under variations of $T_i$ and $T_e$. Our results demonstrate that decreasing $T_i/T_e$ leads to a relative destabilization of trapped electron modes (TEM) over ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, with the transition between these regimes dictated by $T_i/T_e$. When the electron temperature is increased at fixed ion temperature, we observe an increase in transport saturation levels. In contrast, decreasing the ion temperature at fixed electron temperature results in more modest transport enhancement. The radial correlation length, which characterizes eddy size, increases with rising $T_e$ and decreases with falling $T_i$, consistent with the observed trends in turbulent transport. Additionally, we examine the impact of impurity addition on turbulence and growth rates, finding that impurity presence does not significantly alter transport quantities compared to the impurity-free case. Finally, investigating helium as an alternative main ion species, we find that helium plasmas exhibit higher linear growth rates but result in lower transport saturation levels than deuterium plasmas, suggesting potential confinement benefits. These findings provide quantitative insights into the temperature ratio dependence in QH-mode plasmas and highlight the role of temperature profiles and zonal flows in influencing plasma confinement.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of kinetic instabilities in BGK equilibria under collisional effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unstable one-dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) mode has been studied through high-precision numerical simulations. The initial turbulent, periodic equilibrium state is obtained by solving a Vlasov-Poisson system for initially thermalized electrons, with the addition of an external electric field able to trigger undamped, high-amplitude electron acoustic waves (EAWs). Once the external field is turned off, resonant particles are trapped in a stationary two-hole phase-space configuration. This equilibrium scenario is perturbed by some large-scale density noise, leading to an electrostatic instability with the merging of vortices into a final one-hole state. Numerical runs investigate several features of this regime, focusing on the dependence of the instability trigger time and growth rate on the rate of short-range collisions and grid resolution. According to Landau theory for weakly inhomogeneous equilibria, we observe that the growth rate of the instability depends only on the slope of the distribution function in the resonant region. Conversely, the onset time of the instability is affected by the collisional rate, which is able to postpone the onset of the instability. Moreover, by extending the simulations to a long-time scale, we investigate the saturation stage of the instability, which can be analyzed through the Hermite spectral analysis. In collisionless simulations where grid effects are negligible, the Hermite spectrum follows a power law typical of a constant enstrophy flux scenario. Otherwise, if collisional effects become significant, a cutoff is observed at high Hermite modes, leading to a decaying trend.</description>

      <title>Temporal Substepping Scheme for Magnetohydrodynamics with Cell-based Adaptive Mesh Refinement on Staggered Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for numerical magnetohydrodynamics on staggered meshes preserving $\nabla \cdot B = 0$. Our algorithm is based on the constrained transport method and supports both cell-based adaptive mesh refinement and temporal substepping. We handle resolution changes directly on the logically Cartesian grid without needing interpolation or projection between nested or neighboring grids, nor coupling the solution between refinement levels.</description>

      <title>UK White Paper on Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection powers explosive releases of magnetic energy, heating and particle acceleration throughout the plasma universe. Knowledge of this universal process is vital to understanding the Heliosphere, as it plays a key role in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, geomagnetic storms, and interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. As such, reconnection underpins multiple science objectives of multiple future space missions. The UK plays a leading role in this international field, through a combination of in situ measurements from Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, observations of the solar corona and chromosphere, and world-class numerical simulations and theory. This white paper identifies: Nine priority science objectives for reconnection research in the next decade; Recommendations to guide investment in theory, simulations and infrastructure; Mission priorities and required measurements to ensure the UK maintains and improves its world-class credentials in reconnection science.</description>

      <title>A Wave-Based Simulation Model for Cross-Beam Energy Transfer and Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in Laser-Plasma Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present WEBS (WavE-Based Simulations), an efficient wave-based simulation model designed to investigate the dynamic interplay between cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in laser-plasma systems. By employing a unified Schrodinger-type envelope formulation for the laser and ion-acoustic waves, our model enables the use of a single, unconditionally stable Du Fort-Frankel numerical scheme, which maintains excellent long-term energy conservation even with coarse spatial grids. This approach not only achieves high computational efficiency validated against particle-in-cell simulations but also allows the selective activation or suppression of CBET and SBS processes, offering a clear diagnostic of their mutual coupling. Our simulations reveal that at high laser intensities, CBET and SBS reach a coupled steady state, leading to significant deviations from classical fluid theory predictions. Specifically, CBET gain is suppressed due to enhanced SBS reflectivity, while strong asymmetry in SBS reflectivity emerges between the interacting beams. These findings highlight regimes where the two instabilities strongly influence each other, providing critical insights for inertial confinement fusion research and offering a practical numerical tool for instability control and scenario design.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present substantially generalized and improved quantum algorithms over prior work for inhomogeneous linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we show how the norm of the matrix exponential characterizes the run time of quantum algorithms for linear ODEs opening the door to an application to a wider class of linear and nonlinear ODEs. In Berry et al., (2017), a quantum algorithm for a certain class of linear ODEs is given, where the matrix involved needs to be diagonalizable. The quantum algorithm for linear ODEs presented here extends to many classes of non-diagonalizable matrices. The algorithm here is also exponentially faster than the bounds derived in Berry et al., (2017) for certain classes of diagonalizable matrices. Our linear ODE algorithm is then applied to nonlinear differential equations using Carleman linearization (an approach taken recently by us in Liu et al., (2021)). The improvement over that result is two-fold. First, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on error. This kind of logarithmic dependence on error has also been achieved by Xue et al., (2021), but only for homogeneous nonlinear equations. Second, the present algorithm can handle any sparse, invertible matrix (that models dissipation) if it has a negative log-norm (including non-diagonalizable matrices), whereas Liu et al., (2021) and Xue et al., (2021) additionally require normality.</description>

      <title>Diffusion for Fusion: Designing Stellarators with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.</description>
