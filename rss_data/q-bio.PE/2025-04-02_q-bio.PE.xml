      <title>Chaos and noise in evolutionary game dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to describe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent nonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations follow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our understanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos and noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite populations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of the Effective Reproduction Number in an Heterogeneous SIS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This present results lay the foundations for the study of the optimal allocation of vaccine in the simple epidemiological SIS model where one consider a very general heterogeneous population. In the present setting each individual has a type x belonging to a general space, and a vaccination strategy is a function $\eta$ where $\eta$(x) $\in$ [0, 1] represents the proportion of non-vaccinated among individuals of type x. We shall consider two loss functions associated to a vaccination strategy $\eta$: either the effective reproduction number, a classical quantity appearing in many models in epidemiology, and which is given here by the spectral radius of a compact operator that depends on $\eta$; or the overall proportion of infected individuals after vaccination in the maximal endemic state.By considering the weak-* topology on the set $\Delta$ of vaccination strategies, so that it is a compact set, we can prove that those two loss functions are continuous using the notion of collective compactness for a family of operators. We also prove their stability with respect to the parameters of the SIS model. Eventually, we consider their monotonicity and related properties in particular when the model is ``almost'' irreducible.</description>

      <title>Group centrality in optimal and suboptimal vaccination for epidemic models in contact networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of strategies that minimize the number of individuals needing vaccination to control an outbreak is a well-established area of study in mathematical epidemiology. However, when vaccines are in short supply, public policy tends to prioritize immunizing vulnerable individuals over epidemic control. As a result, optimal vaccination strategies may not always be effective in supporting real-world public policies. In this work, we focus on a disease that results in long-term immunity and spreads through a heterogeneous population, represented by a contact network. We study four well-known group centrality measures and show that the GED-Walk offers a reliable means of estimating the impact of vaccinating specific groups of indi\-vi\-duals, even in suboptimal cases. Additionally, we depart from the search for target individuals to be vaccinated and provide proxies for identifying optimal groups for vaccination. While the GED-Walk is the most useful centrality measure for suboptimal cases, the betweenness (a related, but different centrality measure) stands out when looking for optimal groups. This indicates that optimal vaccination is not concerned with breaking the largest number of transmission routes, but interrupting geodesic ones.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Assortativity on Mpox Spreading with Two Core Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of infectious diseases often concentrates within specific subgroups of a broader population. For instance, during recent mpox outbreaks in non-endemic countries, transmission primarily affected men who have sex with men (MSM). However, the internal structure of these subpopulations plays a crucial role in disease dynamics and should be accurately represented in mathematical models. In this study, we highlight the importance of modeling interactions between distinct subgroups and their impact on transmission patterns. We consider a stochastic SEIR-based model with two core groups embedded into the general population, and investigate the outcome of the outbreak with different levels of symmetry between these groups and assortativity in their contacts. Our results indicate that the efficiency of commonly used non-pharmaceutical interventions is greatly influenced by these factors, hence they should be considered in the design of intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Coconvex characters on collections of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phylogenetics, a key problem is to construct evolutionary trees from collections of characters where, for a set X of species, a character is simply a function from X onto a set of states. In this context, a key concept is convexity, where a character is convex on a tree with leaf set X if the collection of subtrees spanned by the leaves of the tree that have the same state are pairwise disjoint. Although collections of convex characters on a single tree have been extensively studied over the past few decades, very little is known about coconvex characters, that is, characters that are simultaneously convex on a collection of trees. As a starting point to better understand coconvexity, in this paper we prove a number of extremal results for the following question: What is the minimal number of coconvex characters on a collection of n-leaved trees taken over all collections of size t &gt;= 2, also if we restrict to coconvex characters which map to k states? As an application of coconvexity, we introduce a new one-parameter family of tree metrics, which range between the coarse Robinson-Foulds distance and the much finer quartet distance. We show that bounds on the quantities in the above question translate into bounds for the diameter of the tree space for the new distances. Our results open up several new interesting directions and questions which have potential applications to, for example, tree spaces and phylogenomics.</description>

      <title>Oscillation in the SIRS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the SIRS epidemic model, both analytically and on a square lattice. The analytic model has two stable solutions, post outbreak/epidemic (no infected, $I=0$) and the endemic state (constant number of infected: $I&gt;0$). When the model is implemented with noise, or on a lattice, a third state is possible, featuring regular oscillations. This is understood as a cycle of boom and bust, where an epidemic sweeps through, and dies out leaving a small number of isolated infecteds. As immunity wanes, herd immunity is lost throughout the population and the epidemic repeats. The key result is that the oscillation is an intrinsic feature of the system itself, not driven by external factors such as seasonality or behavioural changes. The model shows that non-seasonal oscillations, such as those observed for the omicron COVID variant, need no additional explanation such as the appearance of more infectious variants at regular intervals or coupling to behaviour. We infer that the loss of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs on a timescale of about ten weeks.</description>
