      <title>Green's functions, propagation invariants, reciprocity theorems, wave-field representations and propagator matrices in 2D time-dependent materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of wave propagation and scattering in time-dependent materials is a rapidly growing field of research. Whereas for 1D applications there is a simple relation between the wave equations for space-dependent and time-dependent materials, this relation is less straightforward for multi-dimensional materials.
  This paper discusses fundamental aspects of 2D electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation and scattering in homogeneous, time-dependent materials. This encompasses a review of transmission and reflection at a single time boundary, a discussion of the Green's function and its symmetry properties in a piecewise continuous time-dependent material, a discussion of propagation invariants (including the net field-momentum density), general reciprocity theorems, and wave field representations.
  Analogous to the well-known expression for Green's function retrieval by time-correlation of passive measurements in a space-dependent material, an expression is derived for Green's function retrieval by space-correlation of passive measurements in a time-dependent material.
  The paper concludes with the discussion of the propagator matrix for a piecewise continuous time-dependent material, its symmetry properties and its relation with the Green's function.</description>

      <title>Implementation of two-dimensional selective acoustic tweezers merely using four straight interdigitated transducers:a numerical proof of concept of radiation field synthesis by pulsed acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective acoustic tweezers can focus the acoustic radiation force on a single particle to manipulate it without affecting its neighbors. This has long required highly complex hardware. In this numerical study, we show that pulsed acoustic waves can be used for the selective manipulation of particles using only two pairs of orthogonal transducers. While these tweezers are well-known for their ability to manipulate arrays of particles, we show that selectivity can be achieved by using sequences of acoustic pulses to iteratively construct a combined acoustic potential focused only on the target particle.</description>

      <title>Design and Simulation of Si-Photonic Nanowire-Waveguides with DEP Concentration Electrodes for Biosensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-based photonic biosensors, such as microring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers, offer significant potential for the detection of analytes at low concentrations. To enhance response time and improve the limit of detection within practical time scales, dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been proposed as a viable solution. In this approach, two electrodes are placed in close proximity to the sensor surface. By applying an AC field, analytes are transported to the sensor surface due to the polarization of the solvent and the particles, effectively overcoming the diffusion barrier. In this communication, we explore various possibilities for realizing DEP electrodes for nanowire waveguides using commercially available photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations suggest that the most beneficial electrode configuration is a planar electrode geometry on the device layer combined with a second electrode pair on the metal 1 layer.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of TPDH-Nanotube: Insights from Ab initio and Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexa-graphene (TPDH) is a new 2D carbon allotrope with attractive electronic and mechanical properties. It is composed of tetragonal, pentagonal, and hexagonal carbon rings. When TPDH-graphene is sliced into quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structures like nanoribbons, it exhibits a range of behaviors, from semi-metallic to semiconducting. An alternative approach to achieving these desirable electronic (electronic confinement and/or non-zero electronic band gap) properties is the creation of nanotubes (TPDH-NT). In the present work, we carried out a comprehensive study of TPDH-NTs combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Classical Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD). Our results show structural stability and a chiral dependence on mechanical properties. Similarly to standard carbon nanotubes, TPDH-NT can be metallic or semiconductor. MD results show Young's modulus values exceeding $700$ GPa, except for nanotubes with very small radii. However, certain chiral TPDH-NTs (n,m) display values both below and above $700$ GPa, particularly for those with small radii. The analyses of the angle and C-C bond length distributions underscore the significance of the tetragonal and pentagonal rings in determining the mechanical response of TPDH-NTs (n,0) and (0,n), respectively.</description>

      <title>Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modification of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.</description>

      <title>Monolithic lithium niobate photonic chip for efficient terahertz-optic modulation and terahertz generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) frequency range, bridging the gap between microwave and infrared frequencies, presents unparalleled opportunities for advanced imaging, sensing, communications, and spectroscopy applications. Terahertz photonics, in analogy with microwave photonics, is a promising solution to address the critical challenges in THz technologies through optical methods. Despite its vast potential, key technical challenges remain in effectively interfacing THz signals with the optical domain, especially THz-optic modulation and optical generation of THz waves. Here, we address these challenges using a monolithic integrated photonic chip designed to support efficient bidirectional interaction between THz and optical waves. Leveraging the significant second-order optical nonlinearity and strong optical and THz confinement in a thin-film lithium niobate on quartz platform, the chip supports both efficient THz-optic modulation and continuous THz wave generation at up to 500 GHz. The THz-optic modulator features a radio frequency (RF) half-wave voltage of 8V at 500 GHz, representing more than an order of magnitude reduction in modulation power consumption from previous works. The measured continuous wave THz generation efficiency of 4.8*10-6 /W at 500 GHz also marks a tenfold improvement over existing tunable THz generation devices based on lithium niobate. We further leverage the coherent nature of the optical THz generation process and mature optical modulation techniques to realize high-speed electro-THz modulation at frequencies up to 35 GHz. The chip-scale THz-photonic platform paves the way for more compact, efficient, and cost-effective THz systems with potential applications in THz communications, remote sensing, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High Precision Microscale 3D Manufacturing of Ultra Low Expansion Glass by Femtosecond Selective Laser Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its exceptional dimensional stability in harsh thermal conditions and excellent mechanical and optical properties, Corning ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass is the material of choice in many high-demanding fields such as aerospace, astronomy, and advanced optics. This material has recently attracted renewed attention with the advent of femtosecond laser technology, with a particular focus on the interaction of ultrafast pulses and the material itself. Phenomena like the formation of self-assembled nanogratings and their thermal stability as well as the darkening of laser-affected zones have then been characterized. This paper presents how to exploit femtosecond selective laser etching (SLE) techniques to manufacture truly three-dimensional (3D) components. To demonstrate the micron-scale accuracy and repeatability of this process from the mm- to the cm-size range, various devices are designed and fabricated: fiber hole arrays with different hole densities, sizes, orientations, and shapes; and fiber V-groove arrays. Additionally, a mechanical flexural fiber mount is presented as an example of how multiple functionalities can be monolithically integrated into a single piece of glass through SLE technology. An example of a passive alignment substrate for optical components is also shown. SLE technique represents a new advancement in the field of microscale manufacturing, enabling the scalable production of custom-designed ULE glass structures with unprecedented precision and complexity, paving the way for the miniaturized integration of highly stable components.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interferometry-based metrology of magneto-optical properties at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical properties of materials are utilized in numerous applications both in scientific research and industries. The novel properties of these materials can be further investigated by performing metrology in the infrared wavelength range, thereby enriching their potential applications. However, current infrared metrology techniques can be challenging and resource-intensive due to the unavailability of suitable components. To address these challenges, we propose and demonstrate a set of measurements based on nonlinear interferometry, which allows us investigating magneto-optical properties of materials at infrared wavelength range by performing optical detection at the visible range. For a proof-of-principle study, we measure the Verdet constant of a bismuth-iron-garnet, over a spectral bandwidth of 600 nm in the near-IR range.</description>

      <title>Scanning acoustic microscopy characterization of cold sprayed coatings deposited on grooved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of non-planar substrate surface on homogeneity and quality of cold sprayed (CS) deposits was studied by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Fe coatings were cold sprayed onto Al substrates containing artificially introduced grooves of square- and trapezoid-shaped geometries, with flat or cylindrical bottoms. The Al substrates were either wrought or cold sprayed, to comprehend their prospective influence on the Fe coatings build-up. SAM was then used to assess morphological properties of the materials from the cross-view and top-view directions. The microstructure below the surface of the studied samples was visualized by measuring the amplitudes of the reflection echoes and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The SAM analysis revealed that the regions of coating imperfections around the grooves are larger than what is suggested by standard scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Furthermore, we found that the seemingly non-influenced coating regions that appear perfectly homogeneous and dense in SEM do, in fact, possess heterogeneous microstructure associated with the individual CS nozzle passes.</description>

      <title>Transfer printing micro-assembly of silicon photonic crystal cavity arrays: beating the fabrication tolerance limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystal cavities (PhCCs) can confine optical fields in ultra-small volumes, enabling efficient light-matter interactions for quantum and non-linear optics, sensing and all-optical signal processing. The inherent nanometric tolerances of micro-fabrication platforms can induce cavity resonant wavelength shifts two-orders of magnitude larger than cavity linewidths, prohibiting fabrication of arrays of nominally identical devices. We address this device variability by fabricating PhCCs as releasable pixels that can be transferred from their native substrate to a receiver where ordered micro-assembly can overcome the inherent fabrication variance. We demonstrate the measurement, binning and transfer of 119 PhCCs in a single session, producing spatially ordered arrays of PhCCs, sorted by resonant wavelength. Furthermore, the rapid in-situ measurement of the devices enables measurements of the PhCCs dynamic response to the print process for the first time, showing plastic and elastic effects in the seconds to hours range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a modular architecture with superconducting quantum computing chips is one of the means to achieve qubit scalability, allowing the screening, selection, replacement, and integration of individual qubit modules into large quantum systems. However, the nondestructive replacement of modules within a compact architecture remains a challenge. Liquid metals, specifically gallium alloys, can be alternatives to solid-state galvanic interconnects. This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling the nondestructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWRs) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, achieving high internal quality factors up to nearly one million and demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs. Leveraging the desirable fluidic properties of gallium alloys at room temperature and their compact design, we envision a modular quantum system enabled by liquid metals.</description>

      <title>Emergent giant ferroelectric properties in cost-effective raw zirconia dioxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric fluorite dioxides like hafnium (HfO2)-based materials are considered to be one of the most potential candidates for nowadays large-scale integrated-circuits (ICs). While zirconia (ZrO2)-based fluorites materials, which has the same structure as HfO2 and more abundant resources and lower cost of raw materials, is usually thought to be anti- or ferroelectric-like. Here we reported a giant ferroelectric remnant polarization (Pr) amounted to 53 {\mu}C/cm2 in orthorhombic ZrO2 thin film at room temperature. This ferroelectricity arises from an electric field induced anti-ferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition which is particularly noticeable at 77 K. Our work reveals the intrinsic ferroelectricity in ZrO2 thin films and offers a new pathway to understand the ferroelectricity origin in fluorite oxides.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>
