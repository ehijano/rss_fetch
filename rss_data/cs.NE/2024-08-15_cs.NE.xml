      <title>The Potential of Combined Learning Strategies to Enhance Energy Efficiency of Spiking Neuromorphic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring energy-efficient design in neuromorphic computing systems necessitates a tailored architecture combined with algorithmic approaches. This manuscript focuses on enhancing brain-inspired perceptual computing machines through a novel combined learning approach for Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (CSNNs). CSNNs present a promising alternative to traditional power-intensive and complex machine learning methods like backpropagation, offering energy-efficient spiking neuron processing inspired by the human brain. The proposed combined learning method integrates Pair-based Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (PSTDP) and power law-dependent Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to adjust synaptic efficacies, enabling the utilization of stochastic elements like memristive devices to enhance energy efficiency and improve perceptual computing accuracy. By reducing learning parameters while maintaining accuracy, these systems consume less energy and have reduced area overhead, making them more suitable for hardware implementation. The research delves into neuromorphic design architectures, focusing on CSNNs to provide a general framework for energy-efficient computing hardware. Various CSNN architectures are evaluated to assess how less trainable parameters can maintain acceptable accuracy in perceptual computing systems, positioning them as viable candidates for neuromorphic architecture. Comparisons with previous work validate the achievements and methodology of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-Assisted Search with Competitive Knowledge Transfer for Expensive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) have attracted increasing research attention over the decades due to their ubiquity in a variety of practical applications. Despite many sophisticated surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) that have been developed for solving such problems, most of them lack the ability to transfer knowledge from previously-solved tasks and always start their search from scratch, making them troubled by the notorious cold-start issue. A few preliminary studies that integrate transfer learning into SAEAs still face some issues, such as defective similarity quantification that is prone to underestimate promising knowledge, surrogate-dependency that makes the transfer methods not coherent with the state-of-the-art in SAEAs, etc. In light of the above, a plug and play competitive knowledge transfer method is proposed to boost various SAEAs in this paper. Specifically, both the optimized solutions from the source tasks and the promising solutions acquired by the target surrogate are treated as task-solving knowledge, enabling them to compete with each other to elect the winner for expensive evaluation, thus boosting the search speed on the target task. Moreover, the lower bound of the convergence gain brought by the knowledge competition is mathematically analyzed, which is expected to strengthen the theoretical foundation of sequential transfer optimization. Experimental studies conducted on a series of benchmark problems and a practical application from the petroleum industry verify the efficacy of the proposed method. The source code of the competitive knowledge transfer is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/SAS-CKT.</description>

      <title>Massive Dimensions Reduction and Hybridization with Meta-heuristics in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is mainly based on utilizing gradient-based optimization for training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Although robust and widely used, gradient-based optimization algorithms are prone to getting stuck in local minima. In this modern deep learning era, the state-of-the-art DNN models have millions and billions of parameters, including weights and biases, making them huge-scale optimization problems in terms of search space. Tuning a huge number of parameters is a challenging task that causes vanishing/exploding gradients and overfitting; likewise, utilized loss functions do not exactly represent our targeted performance metrics. A practical solution to exploring large and complex solution space is meta-heuristic algorithms. Since DNNs exceed thousands and millions of parameters, even robust meta-heuristic algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, struggle to efficiently explore and converge in such huge-dimensional search spaces, leading to very slow convergence and high memory demand. To tackle the mentioned curse of dimensionality, the concept of blocking was recently proposed as a technique that reduces the search space dimensions by grouping them into blocks. In this study, we aim to introduce Histogram-based Blocking Differential Evolution (HBDE), a novel approach that hybridizes gradient-based and gradient-free algorithms to optimize parameters. Experimental results demonstrated that the HBDE could reduce the parameters in the ResNet-18 model from 11M to 3K during the training/optimizing phase by metaheuristics, namely, the proposed HBDE, which outperforms baseline gradient-based and parent gradient-free DE algorithms evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets showcasing its effectiveness with reduced computational demands for the very first time.</description>

      <title>Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Optimization Strategies to Design an Underactuated Hand Exoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoskeletons can boost human strength and provide assistance to individuals with physical disabilities. However, ensuring safety and optimal performance in their design poses substantial challenges. This study presents the design process for an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx), first including a single objective (maximizing force transmission), then expanding into multi objective (also minimizing torque variance and actuator displacement). The optimization relies on a Genetic Algorithm, the Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm, and their versions for multi-objective optimization. Analyses revealed that using Big Bang-Big Crunch provides high and more consistent results in terms of optimality with lower convergence time. In addition, adding more objectives offers a variety of trade-off solutions to the designers, who might later set priorities for the objectives without repeating the process - at the cost of complicating the optimization algorithm and computational burden. These findings underline the importance of performing proper optimization while designing exoskeletons, as well as providing a significant improvement to this specific robotic design.</description>

      <title>DPSNN: Spiking Neural Network for Low-Latency Streaming Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) improves communication in noisy environments, affecting areas such as automatic speech recognition, hearing aids, and telecommunications. With these domains typically being power-constrained and event-based while requiring low latency, neuromorphic algorithms in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential. Yet, current effective SNN solutions require a contextual sampling window imposing substantial latency, typically around 32ms, too long for many applications. Inspired by Dual-Path Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNNs) in classical neural networks, we develop a two-phase time-domain streaming SNN framework -- the Dual-Path Spiking Neural Network (DPSNN). In the DPSNN, the first phase uses Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) to capture global contextual information, while the second phase uses Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs) to focus on frequency-related features. In addition, the regularizer suppresses activation to further enhance energy efficiency of our DPSNNs. Evaluating on the VCTK and Intel DNS Datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the very low latency (approximately 5ms) required for applications like hearing aids, while demonstrating excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual quality, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Real-world validation of safe reinforcement learning, model predictive control and decision tree-based home energy management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning based energy management approaches, specifically reinforcement learning with a safety layer (OptLayerPolicy) and a metaheuristic algorithm generating a decision tree control policy (TreeC), have shown promise. However, their effectiveness has only been demonstrated in computer simulations. This paper presents the real-world validation of these methods, comparing against model predictive control and simple rule-based control benchmark. The experiments were conducted on the electrical installation of 4 reproductions of residential houses, which all have their own battery, photovoltaic and dynamic load system emulating a non-controllable electrical load and a controllable electric vehicle charger. The results show that the simple rules, TreeC, and model predictive control-based methods achieved similar costs, with a difference of only 0.6%. The reinforcement learning based method, still in its training phase, obtained a cost 25.5\% higher to the other methods. Additional simulations show that the costs can be further reduced by using a more representative training dataset for TreeC and addressing errors in the model predictive control implementation caused by its reliance on accurate data from various sources. The OptLayerPolicy safety layer allows safe online training of a reinforcement learning agent in the real-world, given an accurate constraint function formulation. The proposed safety layer method remains error-prone, nonetheless, it is found beneficial for all investigated methods. The TreeC method, which does require building a realistic simulation for training, exhibits the safest operational performance, exceeding the grid limit by only 27.1 Wh compared to 593.9 Wh for reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning: a Heuristic Three-stage Mechanism for Grid Searches to Optimize the Future Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using EHR-based Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A grid search, at the cost of training and testing a large number of models, is an effective way to optimize the prediction performance of deep learning models. A challenging task concerning grid search is the time management. Without a good time management scheme, a grid search can easily be set off as a mission that will not finish in our lifetime. In this study, we introduce a heuristic three-stage mechanism for managing the running time of low-budget grid searches, and the sweet-spot grid search (SSGS) and randomized grid search (RGS) strategies for improving model prediction performance, in predicting the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year risk of breast cancer metastasis. We develop deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models and optimize them through grid searches. We conduct eight cycles of grid searches by applying our three-stage mechanism and SSGS and RGS strategies. We conduct various SHAP analyses including unique ones that interpret the importance of the DFNN-model hyperparameters. Our results show that grid search can greatly improve model prediction. The grid searches we conducted improved the risk prediction of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year breast cancer metastasis by 18.6%, 16.3%, and 17.3% respectively, over the average performance of all corresponding models we trained. We not only demonstrate best model performance but also characterize grid searches from various aspects such as their capabilities of discovering decent models and the unit grid search time. The three-stage mechanism worked effectively. It made our low-budget grid searches feasible and manageable, and in the meantime helped improve model prediction performance. Our SHAP analyses identified both clinical risk factors important for the prediction of future risk of breast cancer metastasis, and DFNN-model hyperparameters important to the prediction of performance scores.</description>

      <title>Robust online reconstruction of continuous-time signals from a lean spike train ensemble code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensory stimuli in animals are encoded into spike trains by neurons, offering advantages such as sparsity, energy efficiency, and high temporal resolution. This paper presents a signal processing framework that deterministically encodes continuous-time signals into biologically feasible spike trains, and addresses the questions about representable signal classes and reconstruction bounds. The framework considers encoding of a signal through spike trains generated by an ensemble of neurons using a convolve-then-threshold mechanism with various convolution kernels. A closed-form solution to the inverse problem, from spike trains to signal reconstruction, is derived in the Hilbert space of shifted kernel functions, ensuring sparse representation of a generalized Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) class of signals. Additionally, inspired by real-time processing in biological systems, an efficient iterative version of the optimal reconstruction is formulated that considers only a finite window of past spikes, ensuring robustness of the technique to ill-conditioned encoding; convergence guarantees of the windowed reconstruction to the optimal solution are then provided. Experiments on a large audio dataset demonstrate excellent reconstruction accuracy at spike rates as low as one-fifth of the Nyquist rate, while showing clear competitive advantage in comparison to state-of-the-art sparse coding techniques in the low spike rate regime.</description>

      <title>Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</description>
