      <title>Opt4GPTQ: Co-Optimizing Memory and Computation for 4-bit GPTQ Quantized LLM Inference on Heterogeneous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language model (LLMs) on heterogeneous computing platforms poses significant challenges for achieving high inference efficiency. To address the low inference efficiency of LLMs across diverse heterogeneous platforms, this paper proposes a practical optimization method, Opt4GPTQ, designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</description>

      <title>Optimizations on Graph-Level for Domain Specific Computations in Julia and Application to QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex computational problems in science often consist of smaller parts that can have largely distinct compute requirements from one another. For optimal efficiency, analyzing each subtask and scheduling it on the best-suited hardware would be necessary. Other considerations must be taken into account, too, such as parallelism, dependencies between different subtasks, and data transfer speeds between devices. To achieve this, directed acyclic graphs are often employed to represent these problems and enable utilizing as much hardware as possible on a given machine. In this paper, we present a software framework written in Julia capable of automatically and dynamically producing statically scheduled and compiled code. We lay theoretical foundations and add domain-specific information about the computation to the existing concepts of DAG scheduling, enabling optimizations that would otherwise be impossible. To illustrate the theory we implement an example application: the computation of matrix elements for scattering processes with many external particles in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Temperature in SLMs: Impact on Incident Categorization in On-Premises Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures. The results indicate that temperature has little influence on performance, whereas the number of parameters and GPU capacity are decisive factors.</description>

      <title>Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.</description>

      <title>STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</description>
