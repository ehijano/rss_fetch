      <title>Derivations in Dialgebras Derivations and Biderivations in Dialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of derivations and right derivations for Leibniz algebras and $K$-B quasi-Jordan algebras naturally arise from the inner derivations determined by their algebraic structures. In this paper we introduce the corresponding analogues for dialgebras, which we call diderivations, and examine their properties in relation to antiderivations and right derivations. Our approach is based on the study of multiplicative operators and on the construction of the Leibniz algebra generated by biderivations, thereby providing a systematic framework that unifies several types of derivation-like operators. In addition to the general theory, we present a complete classification of the spaces of diderivations for dialgebras of dimensions two and three, obtained through explicit computations. These low-dimensional results not only exemplify the general constructions but also reveal structural patterns that inform possible extensions to higher dimensions and more intricate algebraic contexts.28</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present different characterizations of tripotent orthogonal matrices (i.e., A^3 = A = A^* ) in terms of matrix equations, integer powers of AA^* and A^*A, average of A, A^*, and A^{\dagger}, rank of matrices, and trace of matrices.

      <title>Ternary Gamma Semirings as a Novel Algebraic Framework for Learnable Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.
  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.
  We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the graded automorphism groups of quantum affine spaces and classify these groups for spaces of dimension 7 or less. Using permutation actions on partitions, we investigate cases when the group decomposes as a product of graded automorphism groups of smaller dimensional spaces, and we describe the groups arising from the Kronecker tensor product of independent quantum parameter matrices.</description>

  . Our analysis is structured in three parts. First, we demonstrate that every local and 2-local derivation on this algebra is automatically a derivation. Second, we provide a complete characterization of its biderivations. Finally, we describe its commuting maps and centroid.</description>

Abstract: We examine the Hochschild cohomology for triangular algebras that capture some aspects of geometry and topology of the torus and of the quadric surface, and for deformations of these algebras. In particular, this shows that the cup product on Hochschild cohomology of a triangular algebra does not generally follow the intuition coming from monomial algebras.</description>

      <title>The isotopy classes of Petit division algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R=K[t;\sigma]$ be a skew polynomial ring, where $K$ is a cyclic Galois field extension of degree $n$ with Galois group generated by $\sigma$. We show that two irreducible similar skew polynomials $f,g\in R$ are similar if and only if they have the same bound. We prove that for two irreducible similar skew polynomials $f,g\in R$ the nonassociative Petit division algebras $R/Rf$ and $R/Rg$ are isotopic. We then refine this result and demonstrate that $f$ and $g$ also yield two isotopic nonassociative Petit algebras $R/Rf$ and $R/Rg$, when the two irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ that define the minimal central left multiples of $f$ and $g$ have identical degree and lie in the same orbit of some group $G$. For finite field we explicitly compute the upper bound for the number of non-isotopic algebras $R/Rf$ obtained by Lavrauw and Sheekey.</description>

      <title>Joint Projective Invariants on First Jet Spaces of Point Configurations via Moving Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the action of the projective group $PGL(3,\mathbb{R})$ on the $n$-fold first-order jet space of point configurations on the plane. Using the method of moving frames, we construct an explicit complete generating set for the field of absolute first-order joint projective differential invariants $\mathcal{I}_{n,0}$ for any $n \ge 3$. This approach provides a unified construction for all $n$, immediately ensuring functional independence of the fundamental invariants and yielding formulas suitable for both symbolic and numerical implementation.
  Next, we study the field of relative first-order invariants $\mathcal{I}_n$ with Jacobian multiplier. It is shown that the invariantization of the Jacobian under the projective action yields a primitive element of the field extension $\mathcal{I}_n / \mathcal{I}_{n,0}$.
  Finally, we introduce a multiplicative cochain complex $C^\bullet$ associated with the action of $PGL(3,\mathbb{R})$ on the jet space, and show that the invariantization operator induced by the moving frame generates an explicit contracting homotopy. This provides a constructive proof of the vanishing of higher cohomology and an interpretation of the "defect" of invariantization as an exact cocycle in $C^\bullet$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An nxn matrix A over an arbitrary unitary ring R satisfies invariant left and right Cayley-Hamilton identities with matrix coefficients C(i), D(i) having commutator sum entries. If R has a grading similar to the case of Grassmann algebras, then we prove that C(i)-D(i)-AC(i+1)+D(i+1)A=-2p(i+1)A1 for all i, where A1 and p(i+1) are the odd components of A and of the symmetric characteristic polynomial of A, respectively.</description>

      <title>Some functional identities characterizing two-sided centralizers and two-sided generalized derivations on triangular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let T be a unital triangular algebra, let n &gt; 1 be an integer, let gamma be an invertible element of Z(T), the center of T, and let Psi, Omega:\mathcal{T}\rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ be additive mappings satisfying \begin{align*} \Psi(X^n) = \gamma X^{n - 1}\Omega(X) = \gamma \Omega(X) X^{n - 1}\end{align*} for all $X \in \mathcal{T}$. If $\Omega(\textbf{1}) \in Z(\mathcal{T})$, then $\Psi$ and $\Omega$ are two-sided centralizers on $\mathcal{T}$ and also $\Psi = \gamma \Omega$. Moreover, using a functional identity, a characterization of two-sided generalized derivations is presented. Some other related results are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In [A. Berele, Computing super matrix invariants, {\it Advances in Applied Math. \bf48} (2012), 273--289.] we defined integrals that approximated the Poincar\'e series of the invariants and concomitants of the general linear Lie supergroup or superalgebra. Budzik suggested in [K. Budzik, Supergroup Invariants and the Brane/Negative Brane Expansion, (preprint) arXiv:2509.20451] a way to adapt this method to get the exact Poincar\'e series. The purpose of this paper is to prove that Budzik's ideas are correct. As a consequence we prove that the Poincar\'e series are rational functions.</description>

      <title>Construction and Decoding of Error--Correcting Codes from Ideal Lattices of Finite Ternary Gamma Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new class of error-correcting codes constructed from the ideal lattices of finite commutative ternary Gamma-semirings (TGS). Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks.
  A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method.
  These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is known, every finite-dimensional algebra over a field is isomorphic to the centralizer algebra of two matrices. So it is fundamental to study first the centralizer algebra of a single matrix, called a centralizer matrix algebra. In this article, stable equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields are completely characterized in terms of a new equivalence relation on matrices. Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules. Thus the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences holds true for centralizer matrix algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, torsion theories have played a key role in the study of abelian and pointed categories. In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$. Moreover, we characterise and give a full classification of when $\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ is distributive and further describe when it can be identified with the \emph{distributive closure} of tors$ A$. Finally, we show how the lattices of pretorsion classes, together with their duals, can be used to build pretorsion theories in mod$ A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. In this paper, we introduce the notions of $\textit{reduction order}$ and $\textit{reduction-factorization}$ on words, and use them to show that any right or left Noetherian pointed Hopf algebra over $k$ is affine. This result offers a partial affirmative answer to the classical affineness question for Noetherian Hopf algebras posed by Wu and Zhang \cite{WZ2003}. For a pointed Hopf algebra $H$ over $k$, we construct a well-ordered set $X$ such that: (1) $H$ is generated, as an algebra, by the subset $X_I$ of irreducible letters (with respect to the reduction order); and (2) $X_I$ is finite whenever $H$ is right Noetherian.</description>

Abstract: For a class of neither pointed nor semisimple Hopf algebras $H_{4n}$ of dimension $4n$, it is shown that they are quasi-triangular, which universal $R$-matrices are described. The corresponding weak Hopf algebras $\mathfrak{w}H_{4n}$ and their representations are constructed. Finally, their duality and their Green rings are established by generators and relations explicitly. It turns out that the Green rings of the associated weak Hopf algebras are not commutative even if the Green rings of $H_{4n}$ are commutative.</description>

      <title>PBW-deformations of smash products involving Hopf algebra of Kac-Paljutkin type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H_{2n^2}$ be the Kac-Paljutkin type Hopf algebra of dimension $2n^2$, $A$ its graded Koszul Artin-Schelter regular $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra of dimension $2$, $A^!$ the Koszul dual of $A$, and $A^{\mathrm{op}}_c$ the braided-opposite algebra of $A$. This paper describes $(0, 1)$-degree PBW-deformations of the smash product $A \sharp H_{2n^2}$ and those of $A^! \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ under the condition that the Koszul dual $A^!$ of $A$ is also an $H_{2n^2}$-module algebra. Also, $0$-degree PBW-deformations of $(A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c) \sharp\, H_{2n^2}$ are explored, where $A \otimes^c A^{\mathrm{op}}_c$ is the associated braided tensor product algebra.</description>

      <title>Abelian extensions of five-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the central extension method for solvable Leibniz algebras. Using this method, a complete classification of one-dimensional abelian extensions of five-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebras with a non-trivial three-dimensional nilradical is obtained. Furthermore, we explore extensions of solvable Leibniz algebras whose nilradical is null-filiform, establishing that, in this case, there exists a unique solvable abelian extension.</description>

      <title>The finite basis problem for the endomorphism semirings of finite semilattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every semilattice $\mathcal{A}=(A,+)$, the set $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{A})$ of its endomorphisms forms a semiring under pointwise addition and composition. We prove that that if $\mathcal{A}$ is finite, then the endomorphism semiring $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{A})$ has a finite identity basis if and only if $|A|\le 2$.</description>

      <title>Derived operations satisfy standard identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A derived operation is a bilinear operation on a commutative associative algebra $A$ defined intrinsically out of its product and several derivations of the product. We show that operators of left (or right) multiplications of a derived operation always satisfy a "standard identity" of certain order. In particular, it implies that each Rankin-Cohen bracket of modular forms, as well as each higher bracket of Kontsevich's universal deformation quantization formula for Poisson structures on $\mathbb{R}^n$, satisfies standard identities.</description>

      <title>Infinite Atomized Semilattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of atomized semilattices to the infinite setting. We show that it is well-defined and that every semilattice is atomizable. We also study atom redundancy, focusing on complete and finitely generated semilattices and show that for finitely generated semilattices, atomizations consisting exclusively of non-redundant atoms always exist.</description>
