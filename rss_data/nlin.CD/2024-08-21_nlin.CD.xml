      <title>A dynamical systems perspective on the celestial mechanical contribution to the emergence of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological activities are often seen entrained onto the day-night and other celestial mechanical cycles (e.g., seasonal and lunar), but studies on the origin of life have largely not accounted for such periodic external environmental variations. We argue that this may be an important omission, because the signature replication behaviour of life represents temporal memory in the dynamics of ecosystems, that signifies the absence of mixing properties (i.e., the dynamics are not fully chaotic), and entrainment onto regular, periodic external perturbative influences has been proven capable of suppressing chaos, and thus may bring otherwise unstable chemical reaction sets into viability, as precursors to abiogenesis. As well, external perturbations may be necessary to prevent an open dissipative (bio)chemical system from collapsing into the opposite extreme -- the point attractor of thermal equilibrium. In short, life may precariously rest on the edge of chaos, and open-loop periodic perturbation rooted in celestial mechanics (and should be simulated in laboratory experiments in origin-of-life studies) may help with the balancing. Such considerations, if pertinent, would also be consequential to exobiology, e.g., in regard to tidal-locking properties of potential host worlds.</description>

      <title>Shearless bifurcations for two isochronous resonant perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nontwist systems, primary shearless curves act as barriers to chaotic transport. Surprisingly, the onset of secondary shearless curves has been reported in a few twist systems. Meanwhile, we found that, in twist systems, the onset of these secondary shearless curves is a standard process that may appear as control parameters are varied in situations where there is resonant mode coupling. Namely, we analyze these shearless bifurcations in two-harmonic systems for the standard map, the Ullmann map, and for the Walker-Ford Hamiltonian flow. The onset of shearless curves is related to bifurcations of periodic points. Furthermore, depending on the bifurcation, these shearless curves can emerge alone or in pairs, and in some cases, deform into separatrices.</description>

      <title>Forecasting seasonal rainfall in SE Australia using Empirical Orthogonal Functions and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative forecasting of average rainfall into the next season remains highly challenging, but in some favourable isolated cases may be possible with a series of relatively simple steps. We chose to explore predictions of austral springtime rainfall in SE Australia regions based on the surrounding ocean surface temperatures during the winter. In the first stage, we search for correlations between the target rainfall and both the standard ocean climate indicators as well as the time series of surface temperature data expanded in terms of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). In the case of the Indian Ocean, during the winter the dominant EOF shows stronger correlation with the future rainfall than the commonly used Indian Ocean Dipole. Information sources with the strongest correlation to the historical rainfall data are then used as inputs into deep learning artificial neural networks. The resulting hindcasts appear accurate for September and October and less reliable for November. We also attempt to forecast the rainfall in several regions for the coming austral spring.</description>

      <title>Synchronization behind Learning in Periodic Zero-Sum Games Triggers Divergence from Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in zero-sum games studies a situation where multiple agents competitively learn their strategy. In such multi-agent learning, we often see that the strategies cycle around their optimum, i.e., Nash equilibrium. When a game periodically varies (called a ``periodic'' game), however, the Nash equilibrium moves generically. How learning dynamics behave in such periodic games is of interest but still unclear. Interestingly, we discover that the behavior is highly dependent on the relationship between the two speeds at which the game changes and at which players learn. We observe that when these two speeds synchronize, the learning dynamics diverge, and their time-average does not converge. Otherwise, the learning dynamics draw complicated cycles, but their time-average converges. Under some assumptions introduced for the dynamical systems analysis, we prove that this behavior occurs. Furthermore, our experiments observe this behavior even if removing these assumptions. This study discovers a novel phenomenon, i.e., synchronization, and gains insight widely applicable to learning in periodic games.</description>

      <title>Another comment on claims of a transition to the ultimate regime of heat transfer</title>

Abstract: Claims made by Zhu et al., PRL 120, 144502, (2018), that they had found evidence of a transition to the so called "ultimate regime" in 2D simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, have recently been repeated by Lohse &amp; Shishkina, Rev. Mod. Phys. 96, 03501 (2024). The author questions the validity of these claims.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium and Learning Dynamics in Three-Player Matching $m$-Action Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in games discusses the processes where multiple players learn their optimal strategies through the repetition of game plays. The dynamics of learning between two players in zero-sum games, such as matching pennies, where their benefits are competitive, have already been well analyzed. However, it is still unexplored and challenging to analyze the dynamics of learning among three players. In this study, we formulate a minimalistic game where three players compete to match their actions with one another. Although interaction among three players diversifies and complicates the Nash equilibria, we fully analyze the equilibria. We also discuss the dynamics of learning based on some famous algorithms categorized into Follow the Regularized Leader. From both theoretical and experimental aspects, we characterize the dynamics by categorizing three-player interactions into three forces to synchronize their actions, switch their actions rotationally, and seek competition.</description>

      <title>Recovery of synchronized oscillations on multiplex networks by tuning dynamical time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity among interacting dynamical systems or variations in the pattern of their interactions occur naturally in many real complex systems. Often they lead to partially synchronized states like chimeras or oscillation suppressed states like in-homogeneous or homogeneous steady states. In such cases, it is a challenge to get synchronized oscillations in spite of prevailing heterogeneity. In this study, we present a formalism for controlling multi layer, multi timescale systems and show how synchronized oscillations can be restored by tuning the dynamical time scales between the layers. Specifically, we use the model of a multiplex network, where the first layer of coupled oscillators is multiplexed with an environment layer, that can generate various types of chimera states and suppressed states. We show that by tuning the time scale mismatch between the layers, we can revive the synchronized oscillations. We analyse the nature of the transition of the system to synchronization from various dynamical states and the role of time scale mismatch and strength of inter layer coupling in this scenario. We also consider a three layer multiplex system, where two system layers interact with the common environment layer. In this case, we observe anti synchronization and in-homogeneous steady states on the system layers and by tuning their time scale difference with the environment layer, they undergo transition to synchronized oscillations.</description>
