      <title>Navigating Through Turbulence: Blueprint for the Next Generation of Weather-Climate Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of weather and climate science is at a pivotal moment, defined by the dual forces of unprecedented technological advancement. While a shifting research and employment landscape has created career uncertainty, leading to a significant migration of talent toward the private sector, it has simultaneously spurred an expansion of the ecosystem through the emergence of new computational tools and the growing role of industry innovators and stakeholders. This perspective paper argues that this new, expanded ecosystem presents extraordinary opportunities for students and early-career professionals. We outline the emerging scientific frontiers powered by high-resolution simulations and artificial intelligence, suggest a practical path for navigating a more fluid career landscape, and propose how education and training must evolve to equip the next generation for success.</description>

      <title>Light scattering by random convex polyhedron in geometric optics approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the convex hull construction algorithm, a new geometrical model of ice crystals is proposed to investigate the scattering properties of cirrus clouds particles. Light scattering matrices involving complete polarization information are calculated in geometric optics approximation for randomly oriented large crystals with random and given convex polyhedron shape. The proposed model construction method and computational scheme of light scattering matrix works for any convex polyhedron within the scope of geometrical optics. To illustrate the broad applicability of the proposed ice crystal model, scattering matrices for three ice crystal examples with different geometrical shapes are calculated under a unified computational framework. Diffraction and absorption are not considered in this work. The calculated results for the classical hexagonal column model show overall agreement with those reported by other authors. The crystal model and scattering matrix computational framework developed in this study are applicable to radiative transfer simulations and remote sensing data interpretation in terrestrial and planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Space waste: An update of the anthropogenic matter injection into Earth atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large satellite constellations are one of the main reasons for an increasing amount of mass being brought into low Earth orbit in recent years. After end of life, the satellites, as well as rocket stages, reenter Earth's atmosphere. This space waste burns up and thus injects a substantial amount of its matter into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A first comprehensive analysis of the anthropogenic injection and a comparison to the natural injection by meteoroids was presented by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021). They found significant and even the dominant injection of several metal elements regularly used in spacecraft compared to the natural injection. The first observations of space waste remnants in stratospheric aerosol particles (Murphy et al., 2023) confirmed several of these estimates, but also revealed differences and new insights. The current study presents an update to the space waste injection estimates of Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021), assessing the years from 2015 to 2025 but also considering future mass influx scenarios. 43 elements are considered and thus a much more detailed comparison to the meteoric injection is possible. Comparison of estimated elemental fluxes to stratospheric aerosol data shows excellent agreement. From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24 elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity. This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of specific elements.</description>

      <title>Characterizing global tropical cyclone events of 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full impact assessment of tropical cyclones each year requires a comprehensive sociodemographic analysis. We evaluated sociodemographic characteristics of tropical cyclone-impacted regions during the 2024 calendar year in recent historical context of 1980-2024. In 2024, tropical cyclone-force wind affected an estimated 429,902,820 people (5.5% of global population), and hurricane-force wind an estimated 59,672,600 people (0.8%). Our findings provide a global context for tropical cyclones to better guide resilience and recovery efforts.</description>

      <title>Direct test for critical slowing down before Dansgaard-Oeschger events via the volcanic climate response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is tested whether past abrupt climate changes support the validity of statistical early-warning signals (EWS) as predictor of future climate tipping points. EWS are expected increases in amplitude and correlation of fluctuations driven by noise. This is a symptom of critical slowing down (CSD), where a system's recovery from an external perturbation becomes slower as a tipping point (represented by a bifurcation) is approached. EWS are a simple, indirect measure of CSD, but subject to assumptions on the noise process and measurement stationarity that are hard to verify. In this work the existence of CSD before the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial period is directly tested by inferring the climate's recovery from large volcanic eruptions. By averaging over hundreds of eruptions, a well-defined, stationary perturbation is constructed and the average climate response is measured by eight ice core proxies. As the abrupt DO warming transitions are approached, the climate response to eruptions remains the same, indicating no CSD. For the abrupt DO cooling transitions, however, some key proxies show evidence of larger climate response and slower recovery as the transitions are approached. By comparison, almost all proxies show statistical EWS before cooling and warming transitions, but with only weak confidence for the warming transitions. There is thus qualitative agreement of CSD and EWS, in that the evidence for bifurcation precursors is larger for the cooling transitions. However, the discrepancy that many proxies show EWS but no direct CSD (and vice versa) highlights that statistical EWS in individual observables need to be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation of the wave-zonal flow interactions taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. The necessity of going beyond the traditional approximation in the sub-inertial regime and in weakly stratified regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the Earth's atmosphere and oceans to stellar radiation zones, inertia-gravity waves, which are called gravito-inertial waves (hereafter GIWs) in Astrophysics, are transporting momentum and mixing matter when they are damped through heat and viscous diffusions and when they break. Their short-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis acceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term evolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of the structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the so-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where the local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is neglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this approximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal flow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we take into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and viscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs damping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling must be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited, which is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using the TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and shear-induced breakings are proposed. Taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration leads to a stronger inhibition of the efficiency of the convective and shear-induced overturnings and to a weaker transport than those predicted when assuming the TAR. Finally, a fully non-traditional parametrisation of GIWs - mean zonal flows interaction is derived.</description>

      <title>Statistics of near-inertial waves over a background flow via quantum and statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW) field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the `quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by Danioux, Vanneste and B\"uhler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Superrotation in Slowly-Rotating and Tidally-Locked Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly rotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare and contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and tidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying in particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size, rotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad (which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model that contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet remains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the behavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a Matsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is insufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are additional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the superrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in statistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate: subrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak low-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is always linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps surprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of superrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the continuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from axisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively stronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly dominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing superrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a unified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary bodies.</description>

      <title>Post-processing of wind gusts from COSMO-REA6 with a spatial Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>Using Generative Artificial Intelligence Creatively in the Classroom and Research: Examples and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not new, recent technological breakthroughs have transformed its capabilities across many domains. These changes necessitate new attention from educators and specialized training within the atmospheric and related sciences. Enabling students to use generative AI effectively, responsibly, and ethically is crucial for their academic and professional development. Educators can also use generative AI to develop engaging classroom activities, such as active learning modules and games; however, they must be aware of potential pitfalls and biases. There are also ethical implications in using tools that lack transparency and have a considerable carbon footprint, as well as equity concerns for students who lack access to more sophisticated paid versions of generative AI tools and have deficiencies in prior educational training. This article is written for students and educators alike, particularly those interested in learning more about generative AI in education and research, including its use cases, ethical concerns, and a brief history of its emergence. Sample user prompts are also provided across numerous applications in education and the atmospheric and related sciences. Current solutions addressing broader ethical concerns regarding the use of generative AI in education remain limited; however, this work aims to foster a discussion that could galvanize the education community around shared goals and values.</description>

      <title>FuXi-Ocean: A Global Ocean Forecasting System with Sub-Daily Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution ocean forecasting is crucial for maritime operations and environmental monitoring. While traditional numerical models are capable of producing sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they are computationally intensive and face challenges in maintaining accuracy at fine spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches offer improved computational efficiency and emerging potential, yet typically operate at daily resolution and struggle with sub-daily predictions due to error accumulation over time. We introduce FuXi-Ocean, the first data-driven global ocean forecasting model achieving six-hourly predictions at eddy-resolving 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution, reaching depths of up to 1500 meters. The model architecture integrates a context-aware feature extraction module with a predictive network employing stacked attention blocks. The core innovation is the Mixture-of-Time (MoT) module, which adaptively integrates predictions from multiple temporal contexts by learning variable-specific reliability , mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, FuXi-Ocean demonstrates superior skill in predicting key variables, including temperature, salinity, and currents, across multiple depths.</description>

      <title>Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physically-based causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a novel approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</description>
