      <title>Spectral radii for subsets of Hilbert $C^*$-modules and spectral properties of positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of joint and outer spectral radii are extended to the setting of Hilbert $C^*$-bimodules. A Rota-Strang type characterisation is proved for the joint spectral radius. In this general setting, an approximation result for the joint spectral radius in terms of the outer spectral radius has been established.
  This work leads to a new proof of the Wielandt-Friedland's formula for the spectral radius of positive maps. Following an idea of J. E. Pascoe, a positive map called the maximal part has been associated to any positive map with non-zero spectral radius, on finite dimensional $C^*$-algebras. This provides a constructive treatment of the Perron-Frobenius theorem. It is seen that the maximal part of a completely positive map has a very simple structure and it is irreducible if and only if the original map is irreducible.
  It is observed that algebras generated by tuples of matrices can be determined and their dimensions can be computed by realizing them as linear span of Choi-Kraus coefficients of some easily computable completely positive maps.</description>

      <title>Fourier--Stieltjes category for twisted groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of Fourier--Stieltjes algebras to the category of twisted actions by \'etale groupoids on arbitrary C*-bundles, generalizing theories constructed previously by B\'{e}dos and Conti for twisted group actions on unital C*-algebras, and by Renault and others for groupoid C*-algebras, in each case motivated by the classical theory of Fourier--Stieltjes algebras of discrete groups. To this end we develop a toolbox including, among other things, a theory of multiplier C*-correspondences, multiplier C*-correspondence bundles, Busby--Smith twisted groupoid actions, and the associated crossed products, equivariant representations and Fell's absorption theorems. For a fixed \'etale groupoid $G$ a Fourier--Stieltjes multiplier is a family of maps acting on fibers, arising from an equivariant representation. It corresponds to a certain fiber-preserving strict completely bounded map between twisted full (or reduced) crossed products. We establish a KSGNS-type dilation result which shows that the correspondence above restricts to a bijection between positive-definite multipliers and a particular class of completely positive maps. Further we introduce a subclass of Fourier multipliers, that enjoys a natural absorption property with respect to Fourier--Stieltjes multipliers and gives rise to `reduced to full' multiplier maps on crossed products. Finally we provide several applications of the theory developed, for example to the approximation properties, such as weak containment or nuclearity, of the crossed products and actions in question, and discuss outstanding open problems.</description>

      <title>Murray-von Neumann dimension for strictly semifinite weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a von Neumann algebra $M$ equipped with a faithful normal strictly semifinite weight $\varphi$, we develop a notion of Murray-von Neumann dimension over $(M,\varphi)$ that is defined for modules over the basic construction associated to the inclusion $M^\varphi \subset M$. For $\varphi=\tau$ a faithful normal tracial state, this recovers the usual Murray-von Neumann dimension for finite von Neumann algebras. If $M$ is either a type $\mathrm{III}_\lambda$ factor with $0&lt;\lambda &lt;1$ or a full type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor with $\text{Sd}(M)\neq \mathbb{R}$, then amongst extremal almost periodic weights the dimension function depends on $\varphi$ only up to scaling. As an application, we show that if an inclusion of diffuse factors with separable preduals $N\subset M$ is with expectation $\mathcal{E}$ and admits a compatible extremal almost periodic state $\varphi$, then this dimension quantity bounds the index $\text{Ind}{\mathcal{E}}$, and in fact equals it when the modular operators $\Delta_\varphi$ and $\Delta_{\varphi|_N}$ have the same point spectrum. In the pursuit of this result, we also show such inclusions always admit Pimsner-Popa orthogonal bases.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and generalizations in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a unified fashion, we establish Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorems and their generalizations in systems with long-range interactions. We show that, for a quantum spin chain, if the interactions decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these theorems hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Moreover, any pure state with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of the theorems through various examples.</description>

      <title>Operator-Valued Infinitesimal Multiplicative Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the notions of operator-valued infinitesimal (OVI) free independence, OVI Boolean independence, and OVI monotone independence. For each notion of OVI independence, we introduce the corresponding infinitesimal transforms, and then we show that the transforms satisfy certain multiplicative property. Additionally, we extend the concept of $t$-coefficients to the infinitesimal framework and investigate its properties. Finally, we present an application involving complex Wishart matrices utilizing our infinitesimal free multiplicative formula.</description>
