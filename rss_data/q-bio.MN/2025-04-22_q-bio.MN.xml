      <title>Reciprocating thermochemical mediator of pre-biotic polymer decomposition on mineral surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuing frustration for origin of life scientists is that abiotic and, by extension, pre-biotic attempts to develop self-sustaining, evolving molecular systems tend to produce more dead-end substances than macromolecular products with the necessary potential for biostructure and function -- the so-called `tar problem'. Nevertheless primordial life somehow emerged despite that presumed handicap. A~resolution of this problem is important in emergence-of-life science because it would provide valuable guidance in choosing subsequent paths of investigation, such as identifying pre-biotic patterns on Mars. To study the problem we set up a simple non-equilibrium flow dynamical model for the coupled temperature and mass dynamics of the decomposition of a polymeric carbohydrate adsorbed on a mineral surface, with incident stochastic thermal fluctuations. Results show that the model system behaves as a reciprocating thermochemical oscillator. The output fluctuation distribution is bimodal, with a right-weighted component that guarantees a bias towards detachment and desorption of monomeric species such as ribose, even while tar is formed concomitantly. This fluctuating thermochemical reciprocator may ensure that non-performing polymers can be fractionated into a refractory carbon reservoir and active monomers which may be reincorporated into better-performing polymers with less vulnerability towards adsorptive tarring.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Induced Saturation in Catalytic Reaction Networks: A Differential Geometrical Framework for Modeling Chemical Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of chemical reaction networks is often analyzed through kinetic models and energy landscapes, but these approaches fail to capture the deeper structural constraints governing complexity growth. In chemical reaction networks, emergent constraints dictate the organization of reaction pathways, limiting combinatorial expansion and determining stability conditions. This paper introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks by incorporating differential geometry into the classical framework of reaction kinetics. By utilizing the Riemannian metric, Christoffel symbols, and a system-specific entropy-like term, we provide a new method for understanding the evolution of complex reaction systems. The approach captures the interdependence between species, the curvature of the reaction network's configuration space, and the tendency of the system to evolve toward more probable states. The interaction topology constrains the accessible reaction trajectories and the introduced differential geometrical approach allows analysis of curvature constraints which help us to understand pathway saturation and transition dynamics. Rather than treating reaction space as an unconstrained combinatorial landscape, we frame it as a structured manifold with higher order curvature describing a geodesic for system evolution under intrinsic constraints. This geometrical perspective offers a unique insight into pathway saturation, self-interruption, and emergent behavior in reaction networks, and provides a scalable framework for modeling large biochemical or catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>

Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>A compact model of Escherichia coli core and biosynthetic metabolism</title>

Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and with a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>

      <title>Planar chemical reaction systems with algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hilbert number $H(n)$ is defined as the maximum number of limit cycles of a planar autonomous system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with right-hand sides containing polynomials of degree at most $n \in {\mathbb N}$. The dynamics of chemical reaction systems with two chemical species can be (under mass-action kinetics) described by such planar autonomous ODEs, where $n$ is equal to the maximum order of the chemical reactions in the system. Analogues of the Hilbert number $H(n)$ for three different classes of chemical reaction systems are investigated: (i) chemical systems with reactions up to the $n$-th order; (ii) systems with up to $n$-molecular chemical reactions; and (iii) weakly reversible chemical reaction networks. In each case (i), (ii) and (iii), the question on the number of limit cycles is considered. Lower bounds on the modified Hilbert numbers are provided for both algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles. Furthermore, given a general algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ of degree $n_h \in {\mathbb N}$ and containing one or more ovals in the positive quadrant, a chemical system is constructed which has the oval(s) as its stable algebraic limit cycle(s). The ODEs describing the dynamics of the constructed chemical system contain polynomials of degree at most $n=2\,n_h+1.$ Considering $n_h \ge 4,$ the algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ can contain multiple closed components with the maximum number of ovals given by Harnack's curve theorem as $1+(n_h-1)(n_h-2)/2$, which is equal to 4 for $n_h=4.$ Algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ with $n_h=4$ and the maximum number of four ovals is used to construct a chemical system which has four stable algebraic limit cycles.</description>
