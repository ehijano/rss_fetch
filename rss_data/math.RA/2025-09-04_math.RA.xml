      <title>Associative-Yamaguti algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce associative-Yamaguti algebras as the associative analogue of Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Associative algebras, reductive associative algebras and associative triple systems of the first kind form subclasses of associative-Yamaguti algebras. Any diassociative algebra canonically provides an associative-Yamaguti algebra structure. We confirm that any associative-Yamaguti algebra admits an enveloping associative algebra (i.e., it can be obtained from a reductive associative algebra). We show that a suitable skew-symmetrization of an associative-Yamaguti algebra gives rise to a Lie-Yamaguti algebra structure. Next, we define the $(2,3)$-cohomology group of an associative-Yamaguti algebra to study formal one-parameter deformations and abelian extensions. Later, we consider Yamaguti multiplications on a nonsymmetric operad as a generalization of associative-Yamaguti algebras. This notion further leads us to introduce dendriform-Yamaguti algebras, which are splitting objects for associative-Yamaguti algebras. Finally, we consider relative Rota-Baxter operators on associative-Yamaguti algebras to establish close relationships with dendriform-Yamaguti algebras.</description>

      <title>Spaces of triangularizable matrices (II): Finite fields with odd characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. Denote by $t_n(\mathbb{F})$ the greatest possible dimension for a vector space of $n$-by-$n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}$ in which every element is triangularizable over $\mathbb{F}$.
  It was recently proved that $t_n(\mathbb{F})=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ if and only if $\mathbb{F}$ is not quadratically closed. The structure of the spaces of maximal dimension was also elucidated provided $\mathbb{F}$ is infinite and not quadratically closed. In this sequel, we extend this result to finite fields with odd characteristic. More specifically, we prove that if $\mathbb{F}$ is finite with odd characteristic, then the space of all upper-triangular $n$-by-$n$ matrices is, up to conjugation, the sole vector space of $n$-by-$n$ matrices that has dimension $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and consists only of triangularizable matrices.</description>

      <title>Polynomials over division rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider properties of polynomials with coefficients in division rings.
  A theorem on the decomposition of a polynomial with coefficients in an arbitrary division ring is obtained. It is shown that if a non-central element is not a root of a polynomial over an arbitrary division ring, then the conjugacy class of this element contains infinitely many elements that are not roots of this polynomial. The paper also contains estimates for the number of different conjugacy classes of spherical roots for some types of polynomials over quaternion division algebras.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>

      <title>Dual spaces of lattices and semidistributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birkhoff's 1937 dual representation of finite distributive lattices via finite posets was in 1970 extended to a dual representation of arbitrary distributive lattices via compact totally order-disconnected topological spaces by Priestley. This result enabled the development of natural duality theory in the 1980s by Davey and Werner, later on also in collaboration with Clark and Priestley.
  In 1978 Urquhart extended Priestley's representation to general lattices via compact doubly quasi-ordered topological spaces (L-spaces). In 1995 Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica presented Urquhart's representation in the spirit of natural duality theory, by replacing on the dual side, Urquhart's two quasiorders by a digraph relation generalising Priestley's order relation.
  In this paper we translate, following the spirit of natural duality theory, Urquhart's L-spaces into newly introduced Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces. We then prove that every Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space is the dual space of some general lattice. Based on the authors' 2022 characterisation of finite join and meet semidistributive lattices via their dual digraphs, we characterise general (possibly infinite) join and meet semidistributive lattices via their dual digraphs. Our results are illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Classification of thin Jordan schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize cubic norm structures to cubic norm pairs and extend hermitian cubic norm structures to arbitrary commutative unital rings. For the associated ``skew dimension one structurable algebra" of these pairs, we construct a corresponding Lie algebra and a group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>A note on the ordered set $A^A$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be finite partially ordered sets (ordered sets). We show that if the ordered sets of self-maps $A^A$ and $B^B$ (ordered pointwise) are isomorphic, then $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic. This resolves a question originating with Duffus (1978), with related results by Duffus--Wille and Farley.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free Modules over Commutative Domains of Krull Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a domain of Krull dimension one, we study when the class $\mathcal{F}$ of modules over $R$ that are arbitrary direct sums of finitely generated torsion-free modules is closed under direct summands. If $R$ is local, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under direct summands if and only if any indecomposable, finitely generated, torsion-free module has local endomorphism ring. If, in addition, $R$ is noetherian this is equivalent to say that the normalization of $R$ is a local ring. If $R$ is an $h$-local domain of Krull dimension $1$ and $\mathcal{F}_R$ is closed under direct summands, then the property is inherited by the localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. Moreover, any localizations of $R$ at a maximal ideal, except maybe one, satisfies that any finitely generated ideal is $2$-generated. The converse is true when the domain $R$ is, in addition, integrally closed, or noetherian semilocal or noetherian with module-finite normalization. Finally, over a commutative domain of finite character and with no restriction on the Krull dimension, we show that the isomorphism classes of countable generated modules in $\mathcal{F}$ are determined by their genus.</description>

      <title>An integration of Lie-Leibniz triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the group version of a Lie-Leibniz triple, which we call a Lie group-rack triple. We define a Lie group-rack triple whose tangent structure is a Lie-Leibniz triple, which is a generalization of an augmented Lie rack whose tangent structure is an augmented Leibniz algebra. We show that any finite-dimensional Lie-Leibniz triple can be integrated to a local Lie group-rack triple by generalizing the integration procedure of an augmented Leibniz algebra into an augmented Lie rack.</description>
