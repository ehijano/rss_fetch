      <title>A Survey of Coronal Mass Ejections Measured In Situ by Parker Solar Probe During 2018-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical investigation of the radial evolution of 28 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), measured in situ by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft from 2018 October to 2022 August. First, by analyzing the radial distribution of ICME classification based on magnetic hodograms, we find that coherent configurations are more likely to be observed close to the Sun. In contrast, more complex configurations are observed farther out. We also notice that the post-ICME magnetic field is more impacted following an ICME passage at larger heliocentric distances. Second, with a multi-linear robust regression, we derive a slower magnetic ejecta (ME) expansion rate within 1~au compared to previous statistical estimates. Then, investigating the magnetic field fluctuations within ICME sheaths, we see that these fluctuations are strongly coupled to the relative magnetic field strength gradient from the upstream solar wind to the ME. Third, we identify ME expansion as an important factor in forming sheaths. Finally, we determine the distortion parameter (DiP) which is a measure of magnetic field asymmetry in an ME. We discover lower overall asymmetries within MEs. We reveal that even for expanding MEs, the time duration over which an ME is sampled does not correlate with DiP values, indicating that the aging effect is not the sole contributor to the observed ME asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Forecasting SEP Events During Solar Cycles 23 and 24 Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of the Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events garner increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly, space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed dataset that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's (SDO/HMI) Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager's (SoHO/MDI) Space Weather MDI Active Region Patches (SMARP). We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 +- 0.1, which aligns with but does not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive-negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+ 0.04 +- 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14-hour SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state-selected Carbon Astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The addition of individual quanta of rotational excitation to a molecule has been shown to markedly change its reactivity by significantly modifying the intermolecular interactions. So far, it has only been possible to observe these rotational effects in a very limited number of systems due to lack of rotational selectivity in chemical reaction experiments. The recent development of rotationally controlled molecular beams now makes such investigations possible for a wide range of systems. This is particularly crucial in order to understand the chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium, such as exploring the formation of carbon-based astrochemical molecules and the emergence of molecular complexity in interstellar space from the reaction of small atomic and molecular fragments.</description>

      <title>Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus S$^+$ and brightnesses 2017 -- 2023: insights into volcanic vs. sublimation supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present first results derived from the largest collection of contemporaneously recorded Jovian sodium nebula and Io plasma torus (IPT) in [S II] 673.1 nm images assembled to date. The data were recorded by the Planetary Science Institute's Io Input/Output observatory (IoIO) and provide important context to Io geologic and atmospheric studies as well as the Juno mission and supporting observations. Enhancements in the observed emission are common, typically lasting 1 -- 3 months, such that the average flux of material from Io is determined by the enhancements, not any quiescent state. The enhancements are not seen at periodicities associated with modulation in solar insolation of Io's surface, thus physical process(es) other than insolation-driven sublimation must ultimately drive the bulk of Io's atmospheric escape. We suggest that geologic activity, likely involving volcanic plumes, drives escape.</description>
