      <title>The Sch\"utzenberger groups and maximal subgroups of tropical matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the Sch\"utzenberger groups of the category of matrices over the tropical semiring, $M(\mathbb{T})$, in doing so, we obtain a classification for the Sch\"utzenberger groups of the semigroupoid of matrices over the finitary tropical semiring, $M(\mathbb{F}\mathbb{T})$. We then classify the maximal subgroups of the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over the tropical semiring, $M_n(\mathbb{T})$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; generalising a result in the literature and correcting an erroneous proof. We proceed to show that for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a group which appears as a Sch\"utzenberger group of $M_n(\mathbb{T})$ but does not appear as a maximal subgroup.</description>

      <title>Splittings and poly-freeness of triangle Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the triangle Artin group $\mathrm{Art}_{23M}$ splits as a graph of free groups if and only if $M$ is greater than $5$ and even. This answers two questions of Jankiewicz \cite[Question 2.2, Question 2.3]{Jan21} in the negative. Combined with the results of Squier and Jankiewicz, this completely determines when a triangle Artin group splits as a graph of free groups. Furthermore, we prove that the triangle Artin groups are virtually poly-free when the labels are not of the form $(2,3, 2k+1)$ with $k\geq 3$. This partially answers a question of Bestvina \cite{Be99}.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in virtually solvable matrix groups over algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method of finding large non-positively curved subcomplexes in certain spherical Deligne complexes, which is effective for studying fillings of certain 6-cycles in spherical Deligne complexes. As applications, we show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. In higher dimension, we show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups whose Coxeter diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels can be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond.</description>

      <title>Bounding the degree of generic sharp transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a generically sharply $t$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ satisfies $t\le r+2$ provided the pointwise stabilizer of a generic $(t-1)$-tuple is an $L$-group, which holds, for example, when this stabilizer is solvable or when $r\le 5$. This makes progress on the Borovik-Cherlin conjecture that every generically $(r+2)$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ is of the form $\operatorname{PGL}_{r+1}(F)$ acting naturally on $\mathbb{P}^r(F)$.
  Our proof is assembled from three key ingredients that are independent of the main theorem - these address actions of $\operatorname{Alt}(n)$ on $L$-groups of finite Morley rank, generically $2$-transitive actions with abelian point stabilizers, and simple groups of rank $6$.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low elements and Join Irreducible gates in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the "tight gates" of some "regular" partitions in Coxeter groups. In particular, we study the tight gates of the cone type partition of a Coxeter group $W$; a partition giving rise to the minimal automaton recognising the language of reduced words of $W$ recently studied by Parkinson and Yau (2022) and Przytycki and Yau (2024). We show that "tight gates" are the join-irreducible elements of the $m$-low Garside shadows for $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and the smallest Garside shadow of $W$ under the right weak order. In the case of the tight gates of the cone type partition, we show that they also act as a "gate" of the witnesses of boundary roots of cone types. As an application of these results, we give a very efficient method of determining whether two elements have the same cone type without computing the minimal automaton. We also apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in some select classes of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and Yau for these groups. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the tight gates of the cone type partition in these cases.</description>

      <title>A family of level-transitive groups with positive fixed-point proportion and positive Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a method to calculate the fixed-point proportion of any iterated wreath product acting on a $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the method applies to a generalization of iterated wreath products acting on a $d$-regular tree, which are not groups. As an application of this generalization, a family of groups of finite type of depth $2$ acting on a $d$-regular tree with $d \geq 3$ and $d \neq 2 \pmod{4}$ is constructed. These groups are self-similar, level-transitive, have positive Hausdorff dimension, and exhibit a positive fixed-point proportion. Unlike other groups with a positive fixed-point proportion known in the literature, the fixed-point proportion of this new family can be calculated explicitly. Furthermore, the iterated Galois group of the polynomial $x^d + 1$ with $d \geq 2$ appears in this family, so its fixed-point proportion is calculated.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral products, graph products and p-central series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate polyhedral products of topological spaces to graph products of groups. The loop homology algebras of polyhedral products are identified with the universal enveloping algebras of the Lie algebras associated with central series of graph products. By way of application, we describe the restricted Lie algebra associated with the lower 2-central series of a right-angled Coxeter group and identify its universal enveloping algebra with the loop homology of the Davis-Januszkiewicz space.</description>
