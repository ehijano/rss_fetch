      <title>Direct readout of excited state lifetimes in chlorin chromophores under electronic strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms governing molecular photophysics under electronic strong coupling (ESC) remain elusive to date. Here, we use ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy to study the nonradiative excited state relaxation dynamics of chlorin e6 trimethyl ester (Ce6T) under strong coupling of its transition from the electronic ground state to the Qy band. We use dichroic Fabry-P\'erot cavities to provide a transparent spectral window in which we can directly track the excited state population following optical pumping of either the strongly-coupled Qy band or the higher-lying B band. This scheme circumvents many of the optical artifacts inherent in ultrafast cavity measurements and allows for facile comparison of strongly-coupled measurements with extracavity controls. We observe no significant changes in excited state lifetimes for any optical pumping schemes or cavity coupling conditions considered herein. These results suggest that Ce6T exhibits identical photophysics under ESC and in free space, presenting a new data point for benchmarking emerging theories for cavity photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Bipotentiostatic Control Unlocks Flashing Ratchet Features in Ion Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective separation of same-charge ions is a longstanding challenge in resource recovery, battery recycling, and water treatment. Theoretical studies have shown that ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) can separate ions with the same charge and valance by driving them in opposite directions according to their diffusion coefficients. This process relies on frequency dependent current reversal, a unique feature of ratchets in which the particle current direction is inverted with the input signal frequency. Previous experimental demonstrations of RBIPs achieved ion pumping against electrostatic forces and water deionization, but lacked frequency-dependent current reversal and control of the asymmetry of the device. Here, we report the first experimental realization of these key functionalities by driving RBIPs with a bipotentiostat. Complementary input signals applied to RBIP contacts unlock a flashing ratchet-like behavior, and enhances the device performance by an order of magnitude compared to the prior floating-drive approach. The enhanced control of the electrostatic potential at the RBIP surfaces leads to frequency dependent current reversals, and the addition of a potential offset to the input signal enables tuning the amplitude asymmetry of the device. This flashing ratchet functionality provides a significant step towards the realization of ratchet driven selective ion separation systems.</description>

      <title>A Vibronic Coupling Model to Study the Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Polyenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model for polyenes described by the extended Hubbard-Peierls Hamiltonian. This model is applied to trans-hexatriene to benchmark quantum-classical dynamics methods against fully quantum simulations. We find that surface-hopping methods describe short times more accurately than multi-trajectory Ehrenfest. No quantum-classical method obtains the long-time population oscillations found in fully quantum simulations. Varying the parameters of the LVC Hamiltonian, surface hopping reproduces the correct trends in the long-time dynamics across a wide range of parameters, but generally overestimates the degree of internal conversion. On the other hand, multi-trajectory Ehrenfest gives more accurate long-time populations in proximity to the hexatriene parameter set.</description>

      <title>MLIPAudit: A benchmarking tool for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) promise to significantly advance atomistic simulations by delivering quantum-level accuracy for large molecular systems at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional electronic structure methods. While model hubs and categorisation efforts have emerged in recent years, it remains difficult to consistently discover, compare, and apply these models across diverse scenarios. The field still lacks a standardised and comprehensive framework for evaluating MLIP performance. We introduce MLIPAudit, an open, curated and modular benchmarking suite designed to assess the accuracy of MLIP models across a variety of application tasks. MLIPAudit offers a diverse collection of benchmark systems, including small organic compounds, molecular liquids, proteins and flexible peptides, along with pre-computed results for a range of pre-trained and published models. MLIPAudit also provides tools for users to evaluate their models using the same standardised pipeline. A continuously updated leaderboard tracks performance across benchmarks, enabling direct comparison on downstream tasks. By providing a unified, transparent reference framework for model validation and comparison, MLIPAudit aims to foster reproducibility, transparency, and community-driven progress in the development of MLIPs for complex molecular systems. In order to illustrate the use of the library, we present some benchmarks run on a series of internal models, along with publicly available ones (UMA-Small, MACE-OFF, MACE-MP). The library is available on GitHub at https://github.com/instadeepai/mlipaudit, on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/mlipaudit/ under the Apache License 2.0, and the leaderboard can be accessed on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/spaces/InstaDeepAI/mlipaudit-leaderboard.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Encoding Graph Neural Network for Crystal Structures Property Prediction: Application to Thermal Ellipsoid Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In diffraction-based crystal structure analysis, thermal ellipsoids, quantified via Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs), are critical yet challenging to determine. ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet</description>

      <title>Comparing the Mechanical and Thermodynamic Definitions of Pressure in Ice Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal nucleation studies using hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models have shown that the pressure within the nucleus is lower than that in the surrounding liquid. Here, we use the mechanical route to obtain it for an ice nucleus in supercooled water (TIP4P/Ice) at 1 bar and 247 K. From this (mechanical) pressure, we obtain the interfacial stress using a thermodynamic definition consistent with mechanical arguments. This pressure is compared with that of bulk ice at equal chemical potential (thermodynamic pressure), and the interfacial stress with the interfacial free energy. Furthermore, we investigate these properties on the basal plane. We find that, unlike in hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones systems, mechanical and thermodynamic pressures agree for the nucleus, and the interfacial stress and free energy are comparable. Yet the basal interface displays an interfacial stress nearly twice its interfacial free energy, suggesting that this agreement may be system dependent, underscoring the limitations of mechanical routes to solid-liquid interfacial free energies.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear Spin-Flip TDDFT for Potential Energy Surface Crossings: Conical Intersections and Spin Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently proposed a scheme to generalize collinear functionals to the noncollinear regime, termed the multicollinear approach. The resulting noncollinear functionals preserve spin symmetry while providing numerically stable higher-order functional derivatives. This scheme has already been applied to noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT and its analytic gradient calculations. In the present work, with the aid of the penalty function method, we employ the noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT in multicollinear scheme to locate potential energy surface crossings. We investigate two distinct types of crossings and analyze their topographical and spin characteristics near the crossing points. The first type is conical intersections, typically involving two singlet states such as the ground and first excited states. The second type involves spin crossings that occur between electronic states with different spin multiplicities, such as between singlet and triplet. These crossing regions enable ultrafast nonadiabatic transitions through either nonadiabatic coupling or spin-orbit coupling, playing a crucial role in photochemistry. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantages of noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT over conventional collinear spin-flip TDDFT or spin-conserving TDDFT. Finally, we systematically evaluate its prospects as an electronic structure method for use in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>LFaB: Low fidelity as Bias for Active Learning in the chemical configuration space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning promises to provide an optimal training sample selection procedure in the construction of machine learning models. It often relies on minimizing the model's variance, which is assumed to decrease the prediction error. Still, it is frequently even less efficient than pure random sampling. Motivated by the bias-variance decomposition, we propose to minimize the model's bias instead of its variance. By doing so, we are able to almost exactly match the best-case error over all possible greedy sample selection procedures for a relevant application. Our bias approximation is based on using cheap to calculate low fidelity data as known from $\Delta$-ML or multifidelity machine learning. We exemplify our approach for a wider class of applications in quantum chemistry including predicting excitation energies and ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, the proposed method reduces training data consumption by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard active learning.</description>

      <title>Universal Approach for Determining Multi-Dimensional Anharmonic Vibrations from Electronic Quantum Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and efficient method to incorporate anharmonic effects in the vibrational \textcolor{black}{analyses} of molecules within density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This approach is closely related to the traditional vibrational \textcolor{black}{configuration} interaction (VCI) technique, which uses the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions as the basis. In our implementation, we employ Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), with polynomial prefactors, as the basis set to evaluate the anharmonic Hamiltonian. Although these basis functions are non-orthogonal, the matrix elements such as overlap, kinetic energy terms, and position moments can be evaluated analytically. The terms in the Hamiltonian due to the anharmonic potentials are numerically calculated on a Hermite-Quadrature grid. The potentials can be evaluated using any electronic structure method. This framework enables us to accurately calculate the anharmonicity-corrected vibrational frequencies, the fundamental frequencies, and the corrections to bond lengths in diatomic molecules. This method is also generalized to handle coupled anharmonic oscillators, which is essential to model more complex phenomena such as nitrogen tunneling in the umbrella mode of ammonia (NH$_3$) and Fermi resonances in carbon dioxide (CO$_2$).</description>

      <title>Analytical Excited-State Gradients and Derivative Couplings in TDDFT with Minimal Auxiliary Basis Set Approximation and GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating excited-state gradients and derivative couplings using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) remains a computationally demanding task. An efficient variant, TDDFT with resolution of the identity and a minimal auxiliary basis (TDDFT-ris), has been developed to accelerate excitation energy calculations. However, the formulation and implementation of analytical derivatives for this method have not yet been reported. In this work, we present an implementation of analytical excited-state gradients and derivative couplings within the TDDFT-ris framework. Benchmark calculations on medium-sized organic molecules demonstrate a two- to three-fold speedup for both gradients and derivative couplings compared to standard TDDFT. The accuracy of the TDDFT-ris approach is assessed for gradient-dependent applications, including geometry optimizations, emission energy calculations, and the localization of minimum-energy crossing points. Overall, the TDDFT-ris method provides reliable approximations for most cases, with noticeable errors mainly occurring in derivative couplings between nearly degenerate states.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>
