      <title>Thermo-mechanical behaviour of a tungsten first wall in HiPER laser fusion scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of a tungsten first wall is studied under the irradiation conditions predicted for the different operation scenarios of the European Laser fusion project HiPER, which is based on direct drive targets and an evacuated dry wall chamber. The scenarios correspond to different stages in the development of a nuclear fusion reactor, from proof of principle (bunch mode facility) to economic feasibility (pre-commercial power plant). This work constitutes a quantitative study to evaluate the first wall performance under realistic irradiation conditions in the different scenarios. We calculated the radiation fluxes assuming the geometrical configurations reported so far for HiPER. Then, we calculated the irradiation-induced first wall temperature evolution and the thermo-mechanical response of the material. The results indicate that the first wall will plastically deform up to a few microns underneath the surface. Continuous operation in power plant leads to fatigue failure with crack generation and growth. Finally, the crack propagation and the minimum W thickness required to fulfil the first wall protection role is studied. The response of tungsten as first wall material as well as its main limitations will be discussed for the HiPER scenarios.</description>

      <title>Materials research for hiper laser fusion facilities: chamber wall, structural material and final optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European HiPER project aims to demonstrate commercial viability of inertial fusion energy within the following two decades. This goal requires an extensive Research &amp; Development program on materials for different applications (e.g., first wall, structural components and final optics). In this paper we will discuss our activities in the framework of HiPER to develop materials studies for the different areas of interest. The chamber first wall will have to withstand explosions of at least 100 MJ at a repetition rate of 5-10 Hz. If direct drive targets are used, a dry wall chamber operated in vacuum is preferable. In this situation the major threat for the wall stems from ions. For reasonably low chamber radius (5-10 m) new materials based on W and C are being investigated, e.g., engineered surfaces and nanostructured materials. Structural materials will be subject to high fluxes of neutrons leading to deleterious effects, such as, swelling. Low activation advanced steels as well as new nanostructured materials are being investigated. The final optics lenses will not survive the extreme ion irradiation pulses originated in the explosions. Therefore, mitigation strategies are being investigated. In addition, efforts are being carried out in understanding optimized conditions to minimize the loss of optical properties by neutron and gamma irradiation.</description>

      <title>Sound Reconstruction via Optical Multi-Mode Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound reconstruction via arbitrary objects has been a popular method in recent years, based on the recording of scattered light from the target object with a high-speed detector. In this work, we demonstrate the use of multi-mode fiber as a medium that enables reconstruction at a much further distance. By placing a speaker near the fiber and using a high-speed camera with a maximum region of interest, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the sound without relying on specific grain information in the speckle. Basic filtration techniques and spectral subtraction methods are employed to improve the signal quality. After applying band-stop and high-pass filters, the magnitude-squared coherence between the original sound and captured data is 0.8 at fundamental frequencies. The proof-of-concept method that we introduce here can be extended to monitor the vibrations of earth's crust and civilian buildings for structural safety.</description>

      <title>Capabilities and Performances of the Matter in Extreme Conditions X-ray Imager of LCLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has shown the great potential that X-ray Free Electron Lasers have to study High Energy Density matter. Experiments at FELs have made significant breakthroughs in Shock Physics and Dynamic Diffraction, Dense Plasma Physics and Warm Dense Matter Science, using techniques such as isochoric heating, inelastic scattering, small angle scattering and diffraction. In addition, and complementary to these techniques, the coherent properties of the beam can be used to image HED samples with high precision. We present new imaging diagnostics and techniques developed at the MEC instrument at LCLS over the last few years. We briefly show result of a previously used Phase Contrast Imaging setup, where the X-ray beam propagates from the target to a camera some distance away revealing its phase, as well as from a new direct imaging approach where the target is re-imaged on the camera with 300nm resolution. Last, we show a new Talbot Phase Imaging method that allows for both measuring the phase and intensity changes of the x-rays introduced by a target with sub-micron resolution.</description>

      <title>High Dynamic Range Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We increase the dynamical range of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by actively subtracting dominant current-harmonics generated by nonlinearities in the current-voltage characteristics that could saturate the current preamplifier at low junction impedances or high gains. The strict phase relationship between a cosinusoidal excitation voltage and the current-harmonics allows excellent cancellation using the displacement-current of a driven compensating capacitor placed at the input of the preamplifier. Removal of DC currents has no effect on, and removal of the first harmonic only leads to a rigid shift in conductivity that can be numerically reversed by adding the known removal current. Our method requires no permanent change of the hardware but only two phase synchronized voltage sources and a multi-frequency lock-in amplifier to enable high dynamic range spectroscopy and imaging.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2024. Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method accurate down to a single-photon level that provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of a biological specimen. Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>The CCube reconstruction algorithm for the SoLid experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SoLid experiment is a very-short-baseline experiment aimed at searching for nuclear reactor-produced active to sterile antineutrino oscillations. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented (the basic detection unit is a 5 cm side cube). High segmentation provides numerous advantages, including the precise location of Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of the considerate antineutrino energy estimator, and a powerful background reduction tool based on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of wavelength-shifting fibres coupled to a photodetector (MPPC). This paper describes the design of the reconstruction algorithm that allows maximum use of the granularity of the detector. The goal of the algorithm is to convert the output of the optical-fibre readout to the list of the detection units from which it originated. This paper provides a performance comparison for three methods and concludes with a choice of the baseline approach for the experiment.</description>

      <title>QRIS: A Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System for the Pristine Sample of Asteroid Bennu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantitative Reflectance Imaging System (QRIS) is a laboratory-based spectral imaging system constructed to image the sample of asteroid Bennu delivered to Earth by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dark-Field Imaging in Full-Field Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark-field signal uncovers details beyond conventional X-ray attenuation contrast, which is especially valuable for material sciences. In particular, dark-field techniques are able to reveal structures beyond the spatial resolution of a setup. However, its implementation is yet limited to the micrometer regime. Therefore, we propose a technique to extend full-field transmission X-ray microscopy by the dark-field signal. The proposed method is based on a well-defined illumination of a beam-shaping condenser, which allows to block the bright-field by motorized apertures in the back focal plane of the objective's lens. This method offers a simple implementation and enables rapid modality changes while maintaining short scan times, making dark-field imaging widely available at the nanometer scale.</description>
