      <title>Generating coupled cluster code for modern distributed memory tensor software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific groups are struggling to adapt their codes to quickly-developing GPU-based HPC platforms. The domain of distributed coupled cluster (CC) calculations is not an exception. Moreover, our applications to tiny QED effects require higher-order CC which include thousands of tensor contractions, which makes automatic treatment imperative. The challenge is to allow efficient implementation by capturing key symmetries of the problem, while retaining the abstraction from the hardware. We present the tensor programming framework tenpi, which seeks to find this balance. It features a python library user interface, global optimization of intermediates, a visualization module and Fortran code generator that bridges the DIRAC package for relativistic molecular calculations to tensor contraction libraries. tenpi brings higher-order CC functionality to the massively parallel module of DIRAC. The architecture and design decision schemes are accompanied by benchmarks and by first production calculations on Summit, Frontier and LUMI along with state-of-the-art of tensor contraction software.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>Diverse Transient Chiral Dynamics in Evolutionary distinct Photosynthetic Reaction Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic bacteria to oxygenic cyanobacteria and plants reflects their structural and functional adaptation to environmental conditions. Chirality plays a significant role in influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules in these RCs. This study investigates chirality-related energy transfer in two distinct RCs: Thermochromatium tepidum (BRC) and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (PSII RC) using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Circularly polarized laser pulses reveal transient chiral dynamics, with 2DCD spectroscopy highlighting chiral contributions. BRC displays more complex chiral behavior, while PSII RC shows faster coherence decay, possibly as an adaptation to oxidative stress. Comparing the chiral dynamics of BRC and PSII RC provides insights into photosynthetic protein evolution and function.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound for three binary ($CH_{4}$ + $H_{2}$) mixtures from $p$ = (0.5 up to 20) MPa at $T$ = (273.16 to 375) K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speed of sound is one of the thermodynamic properties that can be measured with least uncertainty and is of great interest in developing equations of state. Moreover, accurate models are needed by the H2 industry to design the transport and storage stages of hydrogen blends in the natural gas network. This research aims to provide accurate data for ($CH_{4}$ + $H_{2}$) mixtures of nominal (5, 10, and 50) mol-% of hydrogen, in the $p$ = (0.5 up to 20) MPa pressure range and with temperatures $T$ = (273.16, 300, 325, 350, and 375) K. Using an acoustic spherical resonator, speed of sound was determined with an overall relative expanded ($k$ = 2) uncertainty of 220 parts in $10^{6}$ (0.022%). Data were compared to reference equations of state for natural gas-like mixtures, such as AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008. Average absolute deviations below 0.095% and percentage deviations between 0.029% and up to 0.30%, respectively, were obtained. Additionally, results were fitted to the acoustic virial equation of state and adiabatic coefficients, molar isochoric heat capacities and molar isobaric heat capacities as perfect-gas, together with second and third acoustic virial coefficients were estimated. Density second virial coefficients were also obtained.</description>

      <title>Determination of the force transmission error in a single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter due to the fluid-specific effect and its correction for use with gas mixtures containing oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density measurements from single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeters need to be corrected to compensate for the magnetic effects of the measuring cell materials and the fluid on the coupling transmission system. While the magnetic effect of the densimeter materials can be easily determined, the fluid effect requires the calculation of an apparatus-specific constant, $\epsilon_{\rho}$. In this work, the apparatus-specific constant of the single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter at the University of Valladolid has been determined by using two alternative methods. The first method, which uses density data for the same fluid and conditions and different sinkers, yielded a value of $\epsilon_{\rho}$ = $4.6\cdot10^{-5}$. The second method, obtained from measurements with pure oxygen, yielded a value of $\epsilon_{\rho}$ = $8.822\cdot10^{-5}$. The second value is considered as more reliable, as the first method presents inherent limitations in this case.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered excited states and real-time dynamics served in a contour integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain. This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator in the integral form--the Riesz projector--is used to design a black-box algorithm for finding a given number of eigen-pairs whose energies are close to a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a generalization, I showcase a novel real-time electron dynamics (RT-EOM-CCSD) algorithm based on the CIF form of the exponential time-evolution operator, which admits extremely large time steps while preserving accurate spectral information.</description>

      <title>Ionization energy: sd transfer error and Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction energy penalty in 3d atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as $E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-1} \mathrm{4s}^1) -E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-2} \mathrm{4s}^2)$. Theoretical concerns have been raised on the validity of these results owing to the evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlations in the $\mathrm{4s}^2$ configuration. Here we define a ground-state measure of the sd transfer error, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from LSDA to PBE to r$^2$SCAN for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we found large (~ 2 eV) ground-state sd transfer errors when applying a Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an "energy penalty" associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a cancellation of s- and d-errors.</description>

      <title>Flexible Trilayer Cellulosic Paper Separators engineered with BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric fillers for High Energy Density Sodium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a full cell configuration having Na$_{3}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ as cathode and pre-sodiated hard carbon as an anode with Cellulosic Paper Separators and compare the electrochemical performance of these ceramic-impregnated polymer-coated cellulose paper separators with commercial glass fiber separator. Notably, the paper-based multilayer separators provide desirable characteristics such as excellent electrolyte wettability, thermal stability up to 200\degree C, and ionic conductivity, which are essential for the efficient operation of SIBs. The cellulose separator is coated by a layer of polyvinylidene fluoride polymer, followed by a second layer of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) polymer in which ferroelectric fillers BaTiO$_{3}$ are integrated, which interacts with the polymer hosts through Lewis acid-base interactions ion and improves the conduction mechanism for the Na$^{+}$ ions. The final lamination is performed by varying the SBR concentrations (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 w/v\%). The incorporated polymer matrices improve the flexibility, adhesion and dispersion of the nanoparticles and affinity of the electrolyte to the electrode. The morphology of the paper separators shows the uniform interconnected fibers with the porous structure. Interestingly, we find that the paper separator with 0.75 w/v\% content of SBR exhibit decreased interfacial resistance and improved electrochemical performance, having retention of 62\% and nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency up to 240 cycles, as compared to other concentrations. Moreover, we observe the energy density around 376 Wh kg$^{-1}$ (considering cathode weight), which found to be comparable to the commercially available glass fiber separator. Our results demonstrate the potential of these multilayer paper separators towards achieving sustainability and safety in energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic State Population Dynamics upon Ultrafast Strong Field Ionization and Fragmentation of Molecular Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air-lasing from single ionized N$_2^+$ molecules induced by laser filamentation in air has been intensively investigated and the mechanisms responsible for lasing are currently highly debated. We use ultrafast nitrogen K-edge spectroscopy to follow the strong field ionization and fragmentation dynamics of N$_2$ upon interaction with an ultrashort 800 nm laser pulse. Using probe pulses generated by extreme high-order harmonic generation, we observe transitions indicative of the formation of the electronic ground X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, first excited A$^2\Pi_u$ and second excited B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states of N$_2^+$ on femtosecond time scales, from which we can quantitatively determine the time-dependent electronic state population distribution dynamics of N$_2^+$. Our results show a remarkably low population of the A$^2\Pi_u$ state, and nearly equal populations of the X$^2\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and B$^2\Sigma^+_u$ states. In addition, we observe fragmentation of N$_2^+$ into N and N$^+$ on a time scale of several tens of picoseconds that we assign to significant collisional dynamics in the plasma, resulting in dissociative excitation of N$_2^+$.</description>

      <title>A photochemical PHO network for hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the detection of phosphine PH3 in the Solar System gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, a direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at Solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at Solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times Solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.</description>

      <title>Disorder enhanced exciton transport and quantum information spreading with the assistance of cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular materials have been studied as a potential platform for highly efficient transport such as exciton transport and quantum information spreading. However, one detrimental factor to transport efficiency is the inherent disorder of the molecular system, where site-to-site hopping is suppressed by Anderson localization. Here we theoretically report a novel approach to eliminate the negative impact of disorder by strongly coupling the system to a cavity, where the cavity photon bridges spatially separated sites and builds an additional transport channel, cavity-mediated jumping. Our analysis of the open quantum system dynamics shows in terms of long-range transport, the two channels hold a competitive relation. When disorder suppresses site-to-site hopping, transport occurs mainly through cavity-mediated jumping in disguise. Therefore, with the assistance of the cavity, disorder in certain ranges can enhance transport and certain disordered systems can even be more efficient for transport than the homogeneous system. These results provide insight into the design of next-generation materials for exciton transport and quantum information spreading by leveraging hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Flow is slow at the nanoscale: Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length all the way down to 1 nm. Our results also make clear that water flow under nano-confinement is orders of magnitude slower compared to the macroscopic case. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Applying Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization in Chemistry: Open Challenges and Major Considerations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) leverages experimental and or computational data of varying quality and resource cost to optimize towards desired maxima cost effectively. This approach is particularly attractive for chemical discovery due to MFBO's ability to integrate diverse data sources. Here, we investigate the application of MFBO to accelerate the identification of promising molecules or materials. We specifically analyze the conditions under which lower fidelity data can enhance performance compared to single-fidelity problem formulations. We address two key challenges, selecting the optimal acquisition function, understanding the impact of cost, and data fidelity correlation. We then discuss how to assess the effectiveness of MFBO for chemical discovery.</description>

Abstract: Gas and moisture sensing devices leveraging the resistive switching effect in transition metal oxide memristors promise to revolutionize next-generation, nano-scaled, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable sensor solutions. These sensors encode readouts in resistance state changes based on gas concentration, yet their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics offer richer dynamics, capturing detailed information about REDOX reactions and surface kinetics. Traditional vertical devices fail to fully exploit this complexity. This study demonstrates planar resistive switching devices, moving beyond the Butler-Volmer model. A systematic investigation of the electrochemical processes in Na-doped ZnO with lateral planar contacts reveals intricate patterns resulting from REDOX reactions on the device surface. When combined with advanced algorithms for pattern recognition, allow the analysis of complex switching patterns, including crossings, loop directions, and resistance values, providing unprecedented insights for next-generation complex sensors.</description>

      <title>Water Desalination by Ferroelectric Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly cleaning of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination as well as for the desalination of sea water using the natural temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Guidance for Discrete Diffusion Models for Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training-free guidance methods for continuous data have seen an explosion of interest due to the fact that they enable foundation diffusion models to be paired with interchangable guidance models. Currently, equivalent guidance methods for discrete diffusion models are unknown. We present a framework for applying training-free guidance to discrete data and demonstrate its utility on molecular graph generation tasks using the discrete diffusion model architecture of DiGress. We pair this model with guidance functions that return the proportion of heavy atoms that are a specific atom type and the molecular weight of the heavy atoms and demonstrate our method's ability to guide the data generation.</description>

      <title>The V30 Benchmark Set for Anharmonic Vibrational Frequencies of Molecular Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermolecular vibrations are extremely challenging to describe but are the most crucial part for determining entropy and hence free energies, and enable for instance the distinction between different crystal-packing arrangements of the same molecule via THz spectroscopy. Herein, we introduce a benchmark data set - V30 - containing 30 small molecular dimers with intermolecular interactions ranging from exclusively van-der-Waals dispersion to systems with hydrogen bonds. All calculations are performed with the gold standard of Quantum Chemistry CCSD(T). We discuss vibrational frequencies obtained via different models starting with the harmonic approximation over independent Morse oscillators up to second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which allows a proper anharmonic treatment including coupling of vibrational modes. However, large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency intermolecular modes are problematic for VPT2. In analogy to the often used treatment for internal rotations, we replace such problematic modes by a simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model. We compare selected dimers with available experimental data or high-level calculations of potential energy surfaces and show that VPT2 in combination with hindered rotors can yield a very good description of fundamental frequencies for the discussed subset of dimers involving small and semi-rigid molecules.</description>

      <title>Line intensities of CO near 1560 nm measured with absorption and dispersion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision line intensities are of great value in various applications, such as greenhouse gas metrology, planetary atmospheric analysis, and trace gas detection. Here we report simultaneous measurements of cavity-enhanced absorption and dispersion spectroscopy of the prototype molecule $^{12}$C$^{16}$O using the same optical resonant cavity. Nine lines were measured in the R branch of the $v=3-0$ band. The absorption and dispersion spectra were fitted separately with speed-dependent Voigt profiles, and the line intensities obtained by the two methods agree within the experimental uncertainty of about 1\textperthousand. The results demonstrate the feasibility of SI-traceable molecular density measurements based on laser spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground and Excited States via Single Reference Coupled-Cluster Theory and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>

      <title>Solving multi-pole challenges in the GW100 benchmark enables precise low-scaling GW calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV between low-scaling and standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV at the $G_0W_0$ level. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules. We thus demonstrate that low-scaling $GW$ with self-consistency in $G$ is well-suited for computing frontier quasiparticle energies.</description>

      <title>SmileyLlama: Modifying Large Language Models for Directed Chemical Space Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we show that a Large Language Model (LLM) can serve as a foundation model for a Chemical Language Model (CLM) which performs at or above the level of CLMs trained solely on chemical SMILES string data. Using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) on the open-source Llama LLM, we demonstrate that we can train an LLM to respond to prompts such as generating molecules with properties of interest to drug development. This overall framework allows an LLM to not just be a chatbot client for chemistry and materials tasks, but can be adapted to speak more directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties.</description>

      <title>Optimizing reaction and transport fluxes in temperature gradient-driven chemical reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature gradients represent energy sources that can be harvested to generate steady reaction or transport fluxes. Technological developments could lead to the transfer of free energy from heat sources and sinks to chemical systems for the purpose of extraction, thermal batteries, or nonequilibrium synthesis.
  We present a theoretical study of 1D chemical systems subjected to temperature gradients. A complete theoretical framework describes the behavior of the system induced by various temperature profiles. An exact mathematical derivation was established for a simple two-compartment model and was generalized to arbitrary reaction-diffusion systems based on numerical models. An experimental system was eventually scaled and tuned to optimize either nonequilibrium chemical transport or reaction.
  The relevant parameters for this description were identified; they focused on the system symmetry for chemical reaction and transport. Nonequilibrium thermodynamic approaches lead to a description analogous to electric circuits. Temperature gradients lead to the onset of a steady chemical force, which maintains steady reaction-diffusion fluxes moderated by chemical resistance. The system activity was then assessed using the entropy production rate as a measure of its dissipated power.
  The chemical characteristics of the system can be tuned for general optimization of the nonequilibrium state or for the specific optimization of either transport or reaction processes. The shape of the temperature gradient can be tailored to precisely control the spatial localization of active processes, targeting either precise spatial localization or propagation over large areas. The resulting temperature-driven chemical system can in turn be used to drive secondary processes into either nonequilibrium reaction fluxes or concentration gradients.</description>

      <title>A transition state resonance radically reshapes angular distributions of the F + H2 -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction in the 62-101 meV energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>
