      <title>Neural Agonist-Antagonist Coupling in the Absence of Mechanical Coupling after Targeted Muscle Reinnervation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following limb amputation and targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), nerves supplying agonist and antagonist muscles are rerouted into separate targeted muscles, disrupting natural neuromechanical coupling between muscle groups. Using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays in reinnervated muscles, we show that neural signals for agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled: motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during corresponding antagonist tasks, despite no visual feedback on coactivation being provided.</description>

      <title>Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>Simultaneity of consciousness with physical reality: the key that unlocks the mind-matter problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of explaining the relationship between subjective experience and physical reality remains difficult and unresolved. In most explanations, consciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal power. The most notable exception is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides a causal explanation for consciousness. However, IIT relies on an identity between subjectivity and a particular type of physical structure, namely with an information structure that has intrinsic causal power greater than the sum of its parts. Any theory that relies on a psycho-physical identity must eventually appeal to panpsychism, which undermines that theorys claim to be fundamental. IIT has recently pivoted towards a strong version of causal emergence, but macroscopic causal structures cannot be causally stronger than its microscopic parts without some new physical law or governing principle. The approach taken here is designed to uncover such a principle. The decisive argument is entirely deductive from initial premises that are phenomenologically certain. If correct, the arguments prove that conscious experience is sufficient to create additional degrees of causal freedom independently of the content of experience, and in a manner that is unpredictable and unobservable by any temporally sequential means. This provides a fundamental principle about consciousness, and a conceptual bridge between it and the physics describing what is experienced. The principle makes testable predictions about brain function, with notable differences from IIT, some of which are also empirically testable.</description>

      <title>State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-level phenomena eventually produce abstract behaviors remains largely unresolved. Here, we propose that a framework based on State Space Models, an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can help bridge this gap. We suggest that the differential equations governing elements in a State Space Model are conceptually consistent with the dynamics of biophysical processes, while the model offers a scalable framework to build on the dynamics to produce emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training a model employing a diagonal state transition matrix on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that neural behaviors such as time cells naturally emerge from two fundamental principles: optimal pre-configuration and rotational dynamics. These features are shown mathematically to optimize history compression, and naturally generate structured temporal dynamics even prior to training, mirroring recent findings in biological circuits. We show that learning acts primarily as a selection mechanism that fine-tunes these pre-configured oscillatory modes, rather than constructing temporal codes de novo. The model can be readily scaled to abstract cognitive functions such as event counting, supporting the use of State Space Models as a computationally tractable framework for understanding neural activities.</description>

      <title>Automated Place Preference Paradigm for Optogenetic Stimulation of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus Reveals Motor Arrest-Linked Preference Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.</description>
