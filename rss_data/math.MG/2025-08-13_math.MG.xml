      <title>Support measures in fractal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel families of geometric functionals-basic contents and support contents-for investigating the fractal properties of compact subsets in Euclidean space. These functionals are derived from the support measures arising in connection with the general Steiner formula due to Hug, Last, and Weil, and offer new tools for extracting geometric information beyond classical fractal dimensions. The basic contents are constructed from the support measures of the set itself, while the support contents arise from those of its parallel sets. Associated scaling exponents characterize the asymptotic behavior of these measures as the resolution parameter tends to zero. We establish a fundamental connection between the maximum of the basic scaling exponents and the outer Minkowski dimension. The proof relies on the novel notion of outer box dimension. Furthermore, we explore how support contents supply aggregated information on geometric features that is provided separately by the basic contents, and how they relate to fractal curvatures and complex dimensions. Our results provide a deeper understanding of which geometric aspects actually contribute to fractal invariants such as the (outer) Minkowski content. We provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>

      <title>The Lonely Runner Conjecture turns 60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation is turning 60. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life. This survey attempts to give a panoramic view of the status of the problem, trying to highlight the contributions of the many papers that it has originated.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm to generate maximally orthogonal frames in complex space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A frame is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to a redundant overspanning set whose vectors are linearly dependent. Frames find applications in signal processing and quantum information theory. We present a genetic algorithm that can generate maximally orthogonal frames of arbitrary size $n$ in $d$-dimensional complex space. First, we formalize the concept of maximally orthogonal frame and demonstrate that it depends on the choice of an energy function to weigh the different pairwise overlaps between vectors. Then, we discuss the relation between different energy functions and well-known frame varieties such as tight and Grassmannian frames and complex projective $p$-designs. Obtaining maximally orthogonal frames poses a global non-convex minimization problem. We discuss the relation with established numerical problems such as the Thomson problem and the problem of finding optimal packings in complex projective space. To tackle the minimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm that features local optimization of the parents. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we propose two visualization techniques that allow us to analyze the coherence and uniformity of high-dimensional frames. The genetic algorithm is able to produce highly-symmetric universal frames, such as equiangular tight frames, symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measurements (SIC-POVMs) and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for configurations of up to $d=6$ and $n=36$, with runtimes of the order of several minutes on a regular desktop computer for the largest configurations.</description>
