      <title>Towards a compleat theory of ecosystem size spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity of ecosystem size spectra is one of the most intriguing and relevant phenomena on our planet. Aquatic size spectra generally show a log-linearly downtrending shape, following a power-law distribution. A constant log-linear slope has been reported for many marine pelagic ecosystems, often being approximately b = -1. Conversely, there are variable trophic-level-biomass relationships (trophic pyramids). The contrasting observations of a constant biomass (M) spectrum slope and highly variable biomass pyramids may be defined as the constant size spectra-variable trophic dynamics paradox. Here, a 'mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of size spectra' (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of available data, literature and models result in the conclusion that most pelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as resource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key role of the maximum carrying capacity of large-sized organisms. This has relevant consequences for the prediction and interpretation of size spectra and the context of fisheries, whaling, and the introduction of exotic predators (e.g., lionfish). The complete size spectrum obtained in situ, including living organisms and non-living particles (e.g., for data from LOPC and UVP) is discussed. This paper is intended as a plea for the integration of modeling approaches, to understand and integrate data and processes across communities including bacteria, phytoplankton, fish and mammals, considering the effect of non-organismic particles.</description>

      <title>Two Issues in Modelling Fish Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish migration is a dynamic phenomenon observed in many surface water bodies on the earth, while its understanding is still insufficient. Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Predation on the Dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in Deer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</description>

      <title>Quantifying movement: Expanding the Ichnologist toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trace-fossil record serves as a rich dataset to examine fossil behaviour, ecologic interactions at community level, and evolutionary trends in behaviour across geological time. Behavioural adaptations are often invoked in a variety of evolutionary hypotheses; however, few methods to quantitatively compare fossil behaviour exist. Movement paths, such as trails and trackways, are well-studied in extant-organism research where they are discretized and mathematically analyzed for behavioural strategies and trends. Here, we reference modern movement ecology research and present a methodology to discretize horizontal movement paths in the fossil record. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology and the spatiotemporal data it collects via an analysis of the trilobite trace fossil Cruziana semiplicata and assess our results in light of three previous assertions about its recorded behaviour. Our analysis reveals the presence of three morphotypes, interpreted as three distinct behavioural variations, which persisted across multiple geographic localities and are interpreted to reflect changes in external conditions, internal states, or a combination of the two. Our research highlights the immense potential of this methodology to test behavioural hypotheses and provides an open-source groundwork for future research.</description>

      <title>Spatial trends in Ediacaran Bilaterian trails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Savannah Hypothesis and the Cambrian Information Revolution invoke the development of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition as a key driver of infaunalization and sensory evolution of mobile bilaterians, respectively. However, difficulties in detecting historical resource distribution hinders the ability to tests these theories. If external conditions crucial to organism fitness (e.g. nutrient distribution, oxygen availability) became increasingly heterogeneous across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, then it follows that benthic organisms dependent on these conditions would demonstrate a similar increase in the spatial variability of their movement trajectories. To investigate Ediacaran resource distribution on the seafloor we examined the morphology of Helminthoidichnites tenuis, a simple unbranched horizontal bilaterian trail, from the Ediacara Member of Southern Australia for spatial trends. Our analysis reveals a as-yet undiscovered variability in the behaviour of the Helminthoidichnites tenuis tracemaker and confirmed heterogeneity in external conditions relevant to the tracemaker in the latest Ediacaran.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Driven Migration and the Evolution of Cooperation in Multi-Player Games on Structured Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation often depends on individuals avoiding exploitation and interacting preferentially with other cooperators. We explore how context-dependent migration influences the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. Individuals interact in small groups through public goods games and reproduce with possible dispersal. Cooperators migrate more frequently when surrounded by defectors, while defectors disperse uniformly. This behavioral asymmetry reflects realistic differences in mobility and social responsiveness. Our results show that conditional migration can promote cooperation by enabling cooperators to escape defector-rich environments and cluster together. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on baseline migration rates, group size, and the sensitivity of cooperators to local conditions. We identify parameter ranges where cooperation is favored even under conditions that would typically hinder its evolution. These findings highlight how behavioral plasticity and dispersal strategies can interact with population structure to support the emergence of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Structured Interactions Drive Abrupt Transitions in the Spatial Organization of Microbial Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria possess diverse mechanisms to regulate their motility in response to environmental and physiological signals, enabling them to navigate complex habitats and adapt their behavior. Among these mechanisms, interspecies recognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological identity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume bacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that either enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through large-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate the emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing the density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully mixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial clusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species, this transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the motility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and interaction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and modular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous random ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand microbial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key to reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Phylogenetic Tree using Gene Sequencing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phylogenetic tree is an important way in Bioinformatics to find the evolutionary relationship among biological species. In this research, a proposed model is described for the estimation of a phylogenetic tree for a given set of data. To estimate a phylogenetic tree there are certain necessary steps have to be considered. Gene sequences are useful data resources to estimate the relationship among species at the molecular level. In this research, the approach is to create a fusion between the existing models for the estimation of phylogenetic trees and a population-based meta-heuristics approach, i.e., Genetic Algorithm. NCBI's Entrez databases are used for the acquisition of gene sequencing data. A modular parallel approach is applied to handle this dataset efficiently. This paper illustrates a proposed model to create an independent platform for phylogenetic tree estimation. Existing benchmark approaches for tree population that are used for population-based meta-heuristic search techniques to find the best possible phylogenetic tree estimation for a given set of gene sequence data.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity drives plasmid maintenance in large microbial communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.</description>

      <title>Prospects for acoustically monitoring ecosystem tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ecosystems can undergo important qualitative changes, including sudden transitions to alternative stable states, in response to perturbations or increments in conditions. Such 'tipping points' are often preceded by declines in aspects of ecosystem resilience, namely the capacity to recover from perturbations, that leave various spatial and temporal signatures. These so-called 'early warning signals' have been used to anticipate transitions in diverse real systems, but many of the high-throughput, autonomous monitoring technologies that are transforming ecology have yet to be fully leveraged to this end. Acoustic monitoring in particular is a powerful tool for quantifying biodiversity, tracking ecosystem health, and facilitating conservation. By deploying acoustic recorders in diverse environments, researchers have gained insights from the calls and behaviour of individual species to higher-level soundscape features that describe habitat quality and even predict species occurrence. Here, we draw on theory and practice to advocate for using acoustics to probe ecosystem resilience and identify emerging and established early warning signals of tipping points. With a focus on pragmatic considerations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and the current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental in understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems and scales.</description>

      <title>Cultural tightness and social cohesion under evolving norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Successful collective action on issues from climate change to the maintenance of democracy depends on societal properties such as cultural tightness and social cohesion. How these properties evolve is not well understood because they emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are usually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a game-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the coevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and norm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and preferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a proliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal properties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can simultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the degree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and reduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the extent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of social homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a population fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different characteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to cooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences for conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have implications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and collective action in times of crisis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.08345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better predict the dynamics of epidemics such as COVID-19, it is important not only to investigate the network of local and long-range contagious contacts but also to understand the temporal dynamics of infectiousness and detectable symptoms. Here, we present a model of infection spread in a well-mixed group of individuals, which usually corresponds to a node in large-scale epidemiological networks. The model uses delay equations that take into account the duration of infection and are based on experimentally derived time courses of viral load and shedding, as well as the detectability of symptoms. We show that due to an early onset of infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of all who came in contact with the detected infected individual reduce the spread of epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We also investigate how the strictness and promptness of the isolation of infected individuals affect the outcome of epidemics. We hope that these more precise node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Species Prey-Predator Dynamics During a Multi-Strain Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small and large scale pandemics are a natural phenomenon repeatably appearing throughout history, causing ecological and biological shifts in ecosystems and a wide range of their habitats. These pandemics usually start with a single strain but shortly become multi-strain due to a mutation process of the pathogen causing the epidemic. In this study, we propose a novel eco-epidemiological model that captures multi-species prey-predator dynamics with a multi-strain pandemic. The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator model and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem's sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations. Our results are aligned with known ecological and epidemiological findings, thus supporting the adequacy of the proposed model in realistically capturing the complex eco-epidemiological properties of the multi-species multi-strain pandemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Functional Motifs in Foodwebs and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When studying a complex system it is often useful to think of the system as a network of interacting units. One can then ask if some properties of the entire network are already explained by a small part of the network - a network motif. A famous example of an ecological motif is competitive exclusion in foodwebs, where the presence of two species competing for a shared resource precludes the existence of a stable equilibrium for the whole system. However, other examples of motifs with such direct impacts on stability are not known. Here we explain why small motifs that allow conclusions on systemic stability are rare. Moreover, we show that another dynamical property, reactivity, is naturally rooted in motifs. Computing the reactivity in motifs can reveal which parts of a network are prone to respond violently to perturbations. This highlights motif reactivity as a useful property to measure in real-world systems to understand likely modes of systemic failure in foodwebs, epidemics, supply chains and other applications.</description>

      <title>Coexistence and Extinction in Flow-Kick Systems: An invasion growth rate approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Populations experience a complex interplay of continuous and discrete processes: continuous growth and interactions are punctuated by discrete reproduction events, dispersal, and external disturbances. These dynamics can be modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate with instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these systems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with state-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth rates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of species when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the extinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of the extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive invasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of the Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to define invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed edges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic, permanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates. Invasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of extinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set. The results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial transfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii) an empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model. Mathematical challenges and promising biological applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider a flexible Bayesian evidence synthesis approach to model the age-specific transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on daily mortality counts. The temporal evolution of transmission rates in populations containing multiple types of individuals is reconstructed via an appropriate dimension-reduction formulation driven by independent diffusion processes. A suitably tailored compartmental model is used to learn the latent counts of infection, accounting for fluctuations in transmission influenced by public health interventions and changes in human behaviour. The model is fitted to freely available COVID-19 data sources from the UK, Greece, and Austria and validated using a large-scale prevalence survey in England. In particular, we demonstrate how model expansion can facilitate evidence reconciliation at a latent level. The code implementing this work is made freely available via the Bernadette R package.</description>
