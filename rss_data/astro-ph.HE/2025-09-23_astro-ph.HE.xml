      <title>New determination of the neutrino hadronic production cross sections from GeV to beyond PeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and on several decades of energy spectrum. Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\sigma(p+p\rightarrow \nu+X)/dE_{\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \bar{\nu_e}$ and $\bar{\nu_\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>NICER observations reveal doubled timescales in Ansky's quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring X-ray bursts originating from the vicinity of supermassive black holes, but their driving mechanisms remain under debate. This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to investigate changes in energy, timescales, and flare shapes. The 2025 QPEs are found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately 10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core of a massive star (M &gt; 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Relativistic Effects in Synchrotron-Emitting Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron emission is seen in a vast array of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), radio supernovae, neutron star (NS) mergers, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Despite the ubiquity of synchrotron-emitting sources, modeling of the emergent flux from these events often relies on simplified analytic approximations. These approximations are inaccurate for high-velocity shocks, where special-relativistic effects are important. Properly incorporating these effects considerably complicates calculations, and generally requires a numerical treatment. In this work we present a novel numerical model which solves the full radiative-transfer problem in synchrotron-emitting shocks, accounting for all relativistic effects. This `full-volume' model is capable of calculating synchrotron emission from a shock of arbitrary velocity, and is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of astrophysical sources. Using this new code, we evaluate the accuracy of more commonly-used approximate models. We find that the full-volume treatment is generally necessary once the shock proper-velocity exceeds $(\Gamma\beta)_{\rm sh}\gtrsim 0.1$, and that approximate models can be inaccurate by $\gtrsim$ an order-of-magnitude in trans-relativistic shocks. This implies that there may be a bias in the inferred physical properties of some FBOTs, jetted TDEs, and other relativistic explosions, where approximate analytic models are typically employed. The code associated with our model is made publicly available, and can be used to study the growing population of relativistic synchrotron-emitting transients.</description>

      <title>Simulated 3D $^{56}$Ni Distributions of Type IIp Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional study of the asymptotic ejecta distributions for a suite of theoretical Type IIp supernovae originating from red supergiant progenitors. We simulate using the radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc{ornax}} from core bounce through the first seconds of the neutrino-driven explosion and then follow using a hydrodynamic variant of the code FLASH until shock breakout of the star and through to homologous expansion of the ejecta into the circumstellar environment. Our studied progenitor models range from 9 to 25 M$_{\odot}$, with explosion energies spanning $\sim$0.1$-$1 Bethe. The shock breakout times span the range $\sim$1$-$4 days, with a breakout time spread by direction ranging from hours to over a day. We find that the dipole orientation of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta is well-preserved from the first seconds out to shock breakout. The $^{56}$Ni ejecta penetrates through the initially outer oxygen shell, and its global structure is imprinted with small-scale clumping as the ejecta evolve through the stellar envelope. For the majority of our models, the neutron star kick is anti-aligned with the $^{56}$Ni ejecta. Models with strongly dipolar ejecta morphology and a massive hydrogen/helium envelope with an inner boundary located deep see as much as $\sim$70\% of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta mixed into that outer envelope, reaching asymptotic velocities ranging from $\sim$350 to 3200 km s$^{-1}$. Supernovae arising from red supergiant progenitors and exhibiting prominent nickel features generally display significant $^{56}$Ni mixing into the stellar envelope.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CTAO Monitoring and Alarm Subsystems in Distributed Environments Using ServiMon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ServiMon is a scalable data collection and auditing pipeline designed for service-oriented, cost-efficient quality control in distributed environments, including the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. Developed within a Docker-based architecture, it leverages cloud-native technologies and distributed computing principles to enhance system observability and reliability. At its core, ServiMon integrates key technologies such as Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka, and Cassandra. Prometheus serves as the primary engine for real-time performance metric collection, enabling efficient monitoring across multiple nodes. Grafana provides interactive, service-oriented data visualization, facilitating system performance analysis. Additionally, Kafka and Cassandra expose system metrics via the JMX Exporter, offering critical insights into infrastructure availability and performance. This contribution exposes how ServiMon could provide an enhancement on scalability, security, and efficiency in a distributed computing environment, such as the CTAO monitoring, logging, and alarm subsystems. This integrated approach not only ensures robust real-time monitoring, but also optimizes operational costs. Furthermore, ServiMon's ability to generate large volumes of diverse data over time provides a strong foundation for predictive maintenance. By incorporating stochastic and approximate computing techniques, it enables proactive failure detection and system optimization, minimizing downtime and maximizing telescope availability.</description>

      <title>A HyperFlash and \`ECLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and \'ECLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($&gt;25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.32\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>First Array-Wide Search for Diffuse UHE Neutrinos with the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino detector at the South Pole, designed to search for radio pulses emitted by neutrino-initiated particle showers in ice. ARA consists of an array of five autonomous stations with 2 km spacing. Each station consists of 16 radio antennas embedded ${\sim}200$ m deep in the ice that are sensitive to either vertically- or horizontally-polarized signals. Radio arrays like ARA represent a cost-efficient means of achieving the enormous detection $O(10~\text{km}^3)$ volumes necessary for UHE neutrino detection. This contribution presents the current status of the first-ever array-wide search for UHE neutrinos, leveraging ARA's unprecedented ${\sim}28$ station-years of livetime. This search will have the best sensitivity of any neutrino detector above $3$ EeV, sufficient to probe the $220$ PeV flux inferred from KM3NeT's observation of KM3-230213A. Importantly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of array-wide neutrino searches, which are necessary for next-generation detectors, like RNO-G (35 stations planned) and IceCube-Gen2 Radio (361 stations proposed), to achieve their design sensitivity. We discuss the progress towards a fully analyzed sample and improvements to ARA's detector characterization and analysis sensitivity.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of the Full Askaryan Radio Array and its Sensitivity to Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is a five-station, in-ice radio detector located at the South Pole searching for particle cascades from cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos with $\geq10^{17}$ eV of energy. Cascades in this energy regime emit radio-wavelength Askaryan radiation that can be observed by one or more ARA stations. With the recent KM3Net observation of an approximately $220$ PeV neutrino, there is renewed, urgent interest in further unlocking the ultra-high energy neutrino sky. We present updated calculations of ARA's array-wide effective volume, sensitivity, and expected event rates for ultra-high energy neutrino-induced cascades. Notably, results now account for the contributions of secondary particles from neutrino interactions (such as muon tracks) and multi-station detections within a detailed detector simulation framework. Previous work has shown these secondary interactions and multi-station coincidences compose 25\% and 8\% of the detector's effective area, respectively. We intend to extend these results towards a novel analysis that estimates the degree to which secondary cascades and multi-station observations are detectable in a real neutrino search. This will inform future UHE neutrino searches as it will characterize the feasibility of detecting such events.</description>

      <title>Dark interactions in neutron star interiors: the interplay of baryons, dark matter, and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.</description>

      <title>Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.</description>

      <title>Reverberation lags viewed in hard X-rays from an accreting stellar-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.</description>

      <title>Binary black holes in magnetized AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN.
  We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.</description>

      <title>Refining the Greisen Profile for Low-Energy Cosmic Gamma-Rays: Quantifying Deviations Across Altitudes and Zenith Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study refines the Greisen formalism by comparing the classical Greisen profile and a modified Greisen profile, which incorporates an empirical correction to the shower age parameter with zenith-angle dependence, aiming to better describe low-energy cascades against CORSIKA simulations of cosmic gamma-ray showers (20-800 GeV). Fittings across altitudes of 5000-5900 m and zenith angles from 0 to 40 degrees quantify deviations in particle numbers, showing that the modified profile yields deviations below 4.7%, compared to up to 12.5% for the classical profile. These improvements address low-energy ionization losses, atmospheric density variations, and zenith-angle effects, enhancing accuracy for high-altitude observatories like HAWC and the proposed CONDOR array. The modified profile offers a computationally efficient alternative, providing precise particle number predictions to advance gamma-ray astrophysics and cosmic-ray research.</description>

      <title>A novel Reverberation mapping method for blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.</description>

      <title>Clues on the X-ray emission mechanism of blazars PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3 through polarization studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarization measurable with the imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}) could constrain the long-debated leptonic versus hadronic origin of the high-energy component in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars. We report \textit{IXPE} results and SED modeling of PKS 2155$-$304 and 3C 454.3, a high- and low-synchrotron-peaked blazar. For PKS 2155$-$304, model-independent analysis gives polarization angle $\Psi_X$ = (130$\pm$2.5) deg and polarization degree $\Pi_X$ = (20.9$\pm$1.8)\% in the 2$-$8 keV band, in agreement with spectro-polarimetric analysis. We found $\Pi_X$ varies with time and shows indications of energy dependence, suggesting stratified emission regions. For 3C 454.3, no X-ray polarization is detected in the June 2023 observation, analyzed here for the first time. The detection in PKS 2155$-$304 and non-detection in 3C 454.3 are consistent with X-ray emission from synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, respectively. Dividing the dataset into finer time bins allows a more granular view of polarization variability. We modeled the broadband SEDs using quasi-simultaneous optical, UV, and X-ray data from {\it Swift}, {\it AstroSat}, and $\gamma$-rays from {\it Fermi}. In PKS 2155$-$304, X-rays lie in the high-energy tail of the synchrotron component, while in 3C 454.3 they lie in the rising part of the inverse Compton component. Our SED modeling with X-ray polarization favors a leptonic scenario for PKS 2155$-$304. These results support a structured jet model where X-ray emission originates from a compact acceleration zone near the shock front, while lower-energy optical emission comes from a broader turbulent region.</description>

      <title>Radiation Mediated Shock and Planar Shock Breakout in the Presence of Atomic Transition Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study fast Newtonian radiation mediated shocks (RMS - v/c~0.2) in two simplified problems in the context of supernova shock breakout; (1) An RMS traveling in a uniform medium, and (2) an RMS escaping a powerlaw density profile in planar geometry (\rho~x^n). Both problems were previously solved in the literature assuming a fully ionized plasma medium emitting Bremstrahllung. It was shown that at high shock velocities photons can deviate from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and reach distributions peaked at many keV.
  In this study we incorporate, for the first time, opacity from bound species of heavy elements (solar-like composition) into these two problems, at times drastically augmenting the photon production due to bound-free and bound-bound radiative processes. We use a previously developed hydrodynamically coupled multi-group radiative diffusion code, including inelastic Compton scattering and frequency-dependent opacity from the publicly available TOPS table. Adding a more realistic opacity leads the radiation to maintain LTE at higher velocities in comparison to the fully ionized problem.
  In the planar SBO problem this opacity can reduce the emission temperature by half and even an order of magnitude. This result is important for the observation of supernova shock breakout emission. The SED of SN envelope breakout will very likely remain in LTE for explosions in red super giant stars without stellar wind (and part of blue super giant star explosions), making X-Ray observations less likely in these cases by orders of magnitude relative to previous predictions. We provide a semi-analytic description for the SED in the case where LTE is maintained. A correct shock-breakout calculation requires opacity tables that include bound yet highly ionized species, ruling out the use of certain line tables (such as the commonly used Kurucz table).</description>

      <title>On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysics, line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the width and separation in frequency of sharp atomic transition lines, leading to the common use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments for the lines. In a previous paper, we calculated shock-cooling emission following explosions in core-collapse supernovae using a mult-group radiative transfer code, and compared the results to those of the similar and often used STELLA code from the literature. We found important differences in the spectral energy distribution (SED) resulting from different choices of line opacity treatment. In our code, we used in the emissivity a frequency-binned average of a high-resolution opacity, while in STELLA the often-used Eastman Pinto 1993 (EP93) prescription was employed. In this short letter we revisit this comparison, essentially reproducing STELLA bound-free (photoionization) and bound-bound (line transition) opacities. We show the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS). We also argue that EP93 is useful for estimating photon mean free-path in the presence of a forest of lines, but that it can underestimate photon production and reprocessing rates (emissivity) by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems. Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Framework for the E1 and E2 Astrophysical Factors at 300 keV from Subthreshold and Ground-State Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction governs the carbon-to-oxygen ratio set during helium burning, shaping white-dwarf structure and Type~Ia supernova yields. At the astrophysical energy $E \approx 300~\mathrm{keV}$, the cross section is controlled by the subthreshold $1^{-}$ (7.12~MeV) and $2^{+}$ (6.92~MeV) states, whose contributions depend on their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, respectively. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ factors using calibrated $R$-matrix mappings and experimental ANC constraints for the $1^{-}$, $2^{+}$, and $0^{+}$ ground state. For $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, flat prior on the $1^{-}$ ANC lead to broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $ [71.4,\,93.4]$~keV\,b, while Gaussian priors concentrate weight near the reported ANC values and yield narrower posteriors. For $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, the analysis includes the interference of the radiative transition through the subthreshold resonance with the direct capture to the ground-state, which depends on the ground-state ANC $C_{0}$, giving broad posterior with $68\%$ credible interval spanning $[30.7,\,50.5]$~keV\,b. The Gaussian priors centered near anchor values. The resulting posteriors quantify both correlations and uncertainties: despite incorporating the published ANC constraints, the $68\%$ intervals remain broad, showing that present ANC determinations do not yet reduce the astrophysical uncertainty. Overall, the Bayesian framework provides statistically robust posteriors for $S_{E1}(300~\mathrm{keV})$ and $S_{E2}(300~\mathrm{keV})$, improving the reliability of extrapolations for stellar modeling and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Impact of Plasma Instabilities and of the Intergalactic Magnetic Field on Blazar-Induced Electromagnetic Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intergalactic weak magnetic fields can have non-negligible effects on the electromagnetic cascades induced by blazar gamma-ray emission. Secondary electrons and positrons are produced by primary gamma rays of energies ~TeV and can be magnetically deflected out of the line of sight to the observer. However, these leptons can perturb the background intergalactic medium (IGM), resulting in the growth of plasma instabilities, which can also influence the electromagnetic cascade. The resulting gamma-ray spectrum, observable in the GeV-TeV energy range, can bear imprints of these two competing phenomena: deflection by the intergalactic magnetic field and plasma instability cooling. We present the results of numerical simulations that incorporate the combined impact of these two processes on the propagated gamma-ray spectrum of the blazar 1ES 0229+200.</description>

      <title>Probing hadronic interactions with high-energy and low-energy muons in extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy cosmic rays are observed indirectly by detecting the extensive air showers initiated in Earth's atmosphere. The interpretation of experimental data relies on accurate modeling of the air shower development. Simulations based on current hadronic interaction models show significant discrepancies with measurements of the muon content in air showers, commonly referred to as the Muon Puzzle, indicating severe shortcomings in the understanding of particle physics. A hybrid detector design with a surface array and deep underground detector, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, allows simultaneous measurements of muons at two vastly different energies: at GeV energies and above a few 100GeV. We present phenomenological studies of low-energy and high-energy muons in simulated air showers, and discuss how hybrid measurements can provide constraints on multi-particle production in hadronic interaction models.</description>

      <title>The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ J1243+4043</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In recent years, changing-look blazars have put into question the traditional BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars empirical classification of blazars based on the intensity of optical spectral lines, as they appear to transition between the two classes over time. Aims. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing look in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime properties among different epochs. Methods. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. Results. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift $z = 1.5181\pm0.0002$ known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless, and we place limits on the emission lines and related physical properties. We observe spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Despite this, the accretion properties of the blazar remain, overall, unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics remains the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 remains characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, that may foster neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Relativistically-strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\omega^\ast - k^\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\omega) \geq B_0$, cannot propagate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we have investigated the energy spectra of the elemental mass groups of cosmic rays for the Light (H+He), medium (C+O) and heavy (Ne-Fe) components using the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Gamma-Ray observatory (HAWC). The study was carried out in the energy interval from $10$ TeV to $1$ PeV using almost $5$ years of data on hadronic air showers. The energy spectra were unfolded using the bidimensional distribution of the lateral shower age versus the reconstructed primary energy. We have employed the QGSJET-II-04 high-energy hadronic interaction model for the current analysis. The results show the presence of fine structure in the spectra of the light, medium and heavy mass groups of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Recent measurements of the spectrum and composition of cosmic rays between 10 TeV and 1 EeV from EAS experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two decades, different advances with extensive air shower (EAS) experiments have allowed to unveil several details about the composition and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays from some TeV up to several hundreds of PeV, which have led to improve our understanding of the physics of cosmic rays. EAS measurements above the knee, for instance, have helped to understand some aspects about the acceleration and propagation mechanisms of the PeV component of cosmic rays and have shown possible hints about the transition from the galactic to the extragalactic regime. Meanwhile, EAS data in the TeV energy range have revealed unexpected features in the all-particle and elemental spectra, which may indicate the presence of previously unknown cosmic-ray phenomena. In this contribution, I will present a brief account on these EAS results, with particular emphasis on the recent measurements of the all-particle energy spectrum and the elemental composition of cosmic rays from 10 TeV up to 1 EeV. In addition, I will compare the latest results of EAS experiments and direct detectors at energies just below the knee, where there exists an overlap between both detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Methods for statistical detection of GRBs in the context of the LST-CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) afterglows are rapidly decaying signals that pose significant detection challenges, requiring improved methods to track their temporal evolution. In this study, we systematically compare various techniques for detecting GRB-like transient emissions at very high energies (VHE, &gt;100 GeV). Our analysis includes time-dependent extension of the standard method (i.e., Li &amp; Ma 1983) and other previously developed methods in the literature, alongside a novel likelihood-based approach, which directly fits spectral and temporal decay features to IACT data. Through dedicated observation simulations, we evaluate the performance of these methods for the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We characterised the enhanced sensitivity found in some of these methods compared to the standard significance estimation. For GRBs simulated with very fast afterglow decay, an improvement of more than a factor of two is seen in detections for some of the methods presented here, compared to the standard Li&amp;Ma approach.</description>

      <title>The 6 year radio lightcurve of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with radio antennas in the ground-based observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Quantum Nature of Black Holes: Towards a Proof of Hawking Radiation through Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking's groundbreaking prediction that black holes emit thermal radiation and ultimately evaporate remains unverified due to the extreme faintness of this radiation for stellar-mass or larger black holes. In this study, we explore a novel observational strategy to search for Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass black hole morsels -- hypothetical small black holes that may form and be ejected during catastrophic events such as binary black hole mergers. These black hole morsels are expected to emit gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range on observable timescales. We analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope coinciding with the well-localized binary black hole merger GW170814, searching for delayed gamma-ray signatures associated with morsel evaporation. While we find no evidence for such emission, we place exclusion limits on morsel masses, ruling out the 4 x 10^8 kg scenario at the 95 percent confidence level for a total emitted mass of one solar mass. We also outline future directions, including the incorporation of late-time evaporation spikes, systematic application across the growing gravitational wave catalog, and the enhanced discovery potential of next-generation facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.</description>

      <title>Neural likelihood estimators for flexible gravitational wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time. We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Unexpected Seasonal Variation of Multi-Muon Events at NO$\nu$A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seasonal variation of single muons is a well-understood phenomenon, mainly driven by a positive correlation with temperature fluctuations in the atmospheric profiles. However, the rate of multi-muon events recorded by various experiments has shown an intriguing opposite seasonal modulation that remains unexplained by previous research. For the first time, we quantitatively describe the phase and amplitudes of the seasonal variation for cosmic multi-muon events detected by the NO$\nu$A Near Detector. We can further explain the amplitude dependence for multi-muon events across various multiplicities. For our analysis, we use the general-purpose Monte Carlo code FLUKA-CERN 4.4.1, which provides a more realistic description of the detector, atmospheric profiles, and muon propagation underground. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained from the latest CORSIKA version 7.8010, utilizing the most up-to-date high-energy hadronic interaction models EPOS LHC-R and QGSJETIII-01. Our findings provide a fresh perspective on seasonal muon flux modulation and offer key constraints for cosmic-ray interaction models and underground detector studies.</description>

      <title>Molecular clouds as a tool to constraint sub-GeV dark matter and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo parameter study for Seyfert AGN-starburst composite galaxies NGC1068 and NGC7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies host two promising phenomena of non-thermal high-energy radiation. In this regard the IceCube observation of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy NGC 1068 is not surprising. More recently, another Seyfert-starburst composite galaxy, NGC 7469, has shown hints for neutrino emission at even higher energies. Theoretical investigations could clarify that their so-called AGN corona is the most-likely origin of these neutrinos due to the need of being partially $\gamma$-ray opaque. In this work, we present an updated version of our Seyfert-starburst composite model from 2022, that accounts for a proper treatment of the stochastic acceleration processes in the AGN corona and the secondary electrons and positrons from leptonic radiation processes. Moreover, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to study the parameter space of these two potential high-energy neutrino sources under consideration of the given prior knowledge. In the case of NGC 1068, we can successfully explain its non-thermal observational features, where both its AGN corona and starburst ring are needed to account for the observations at high- energies. In the case of NGC 7469, the high-energy signatures can only be explained assuming a small coronal radius and the including external $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation. In general, both sources exhibit a strong influence of the $\gamma$-ray opaqueness on the results, highlighting the need for an accurate treatment of the intrinsic coronal X-ray field and the spatial extent of the $\gamma$-ray production site.</description>

      <title>Bound-state resonances of the Schwarzschild black hole: Analytic treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by an earlier idea of Mashhoon, who suggested to relate the discrete quasinormal resonant modes of a black hole to the bound-state resonances of the corresponding inverted black-hole potential, V\"olkel [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 241401 (2025)] has recently computed numerically, for the first time, the bound-state energy spectrum of the inverted Schwarzschild potential. Motivated by this intriguing work, in the present work we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical and mathematical properties of the Schwarzschild bound-state resonances. In particular, we derive closed-form compact analytical formulas for the infinite spectrum $\{E_n\}_{n=0}^{n=\infty}$ of energy eigenvalues that characterize the inverted (binding) black-hole potential. Interestingly, it is explicitly shown that our analytically derived energy spectrum of the black-hole inverted potential agrees remarkably well with the corresponding numerical data that recently appeared in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays interact with nuclei in the Earth's atmosphere to produce extensive air showers, which give rise to the atmospheric muon flux. Temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere influence the rate of muons measured in deep underground experiments. This contribution presents predictions of the daily muon flux at a depth of 2000 m.w.e., calculated using MUTE, a software tool which combines MCEq, a numerical solver of the matrix cascade equations in the atmosphere, with PROPOSAL, a propagation code for leptons in matter. The flux estimates are obtained assuming different cosmic-ray flux and hadronic interaction models. The results are compared to previous approaches, based on different methods, to calculate seasonal variations of atmospheric muons in deep underground detectors.</description>

      <title>An Einstein ring fingerprint around SMBHs illuminated by BLR spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08690v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuum emission from the hot and ionized inner regions of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk that is strongly lensed by the light-ring (i.e., the unstable photon orbit), is always superimposed on that of the locally emitting plasma near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), masking strong-gravity effects and making their study difficult. A cleaner image of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the emission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus be preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate this can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts of the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line emission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR may be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited for strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line illumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun signal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could be evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be acquired. In resolved sources, the combination of information from the image and the spectrum can even facilitate the measurement of the mass of the SMBH.</description>

      <title>SMBH shadows: gravity fingerprints revealed by spectral line background radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08728v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, illuminated by their accretion disks, can reveal valuable information on BH spacetimes via their shadows, which can be used for strong-gravity tests. However, the continuum emission from their highly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with very inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects, like the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of strong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and strongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the way to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed radiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the ISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from accretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes the spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the extended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral phase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator, typically found at $r\sim (10^2-10^4)\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can provide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more information on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we examine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning strong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the fact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the form of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and its spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass, while the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the SMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge \(Q\), features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \(r_\ast = \frac{2|Q|}{\pi}\) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle's charge-to-mass ratio \(\frac{|q|}{m}\). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\(r \gg |Q|\)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \(r_\ast\), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the canonical thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations of Low-Energy Explosions of Red and Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of physical processes leads to the low-energy ejection of material from the hydrogen-rich envelopes of red and yellow supergiants. These include common envelope events, stellar mergers, eruptive mass loss, and failed supernovae. These events may appear as luminous red novae, intermediate luminosity red transients, supernova imposters, or other transients with similar lightcurves and colors that are followed by the disappearance of the progenitor star (e.g. failed supernovae). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find these events in large numbers; detailed modeling of their lightcurves is essential for photometrically differentiating between these important physical processes in the lives of massive stars. We use one-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model the lightcurves of low-energy explosions of red and yellow supergiants. Red supergiant explosions have durations of 100-400 days, longer than Type IIp supernovae, while stripped, yellow supergiant explosions have durations of 10s of days. Our models probe the boundary between the radiation-pressure dominated and gas-pressure dominated regimes. We provide fitting formulae for the plateau luminosity and duration of the events. Finally, we show that the failed supernovae candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are consistent with failed supernovae models for explosion energies of $\sim10^{47}-10^{49}$ erg.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays in Galaxy Halos: Impacts on Galactic Outflows and Baryon Cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies with high star-formation rate surface densities often host large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations of Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars and Gravitational-Wave Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, for the first time, universal relations for anisotropic dark energy stars. The stars are modeled with the modified Chaplygin equation of state and the Bowers-Liang prescription for anisotropy, and their global properties and $f$-mode frequencies are computed using the modified relativistic Hartle-Thorne slow rotation and Cowling approximations. We find that relations among moment of inertia, tidal deformability, quadrupole moment and $f$-mode frequency exhibit universality, with deviations limited to $1-10\%$, in close agreement with other compact star models. Using tidal deformability constraints from GW170817 and GW190814, we obtain astrophysical limits on canonical properties of dark energy stars. For positive anisotropy strength, the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star is constrained to $R_{1.4}=8.93^{1.88}_{1.40}$ km (GW170817) and $10.92^{+0.71}_{-0.54}$ km (GW190814), consistent with observational bounds. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies are constrained to $3.257^{+0.450}_{-0.537}$ kHz and $2.692^{+0.137}_{-0.157}$ kHz. Further, applying Pearson correlation analysis for the first time to anisotropic compact stars, we obtained the coefficients between various stellar attributes of dark energy stars and we show that the Chaplygin parameter $B$ correlates strongly with the $f$-mode frequency, with positive anisotropy strengthening while negative anisotropy weakening the correlation strength. These results establish that universal relations extend to anisotropic dark energy stars and can be directly tested with present and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Correction to Dynamical Response of Relativistic Plasma in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collective excitations in a relativistic collisionless plasma composed of massless fermions subject to an external magnetic field. We include dynamical electromagnetism and fluctuations of the chiral charge, while maintaining a vanishing net chiral charge. Within the framework of chiral kinetic theory, we find that the chiral anomaly gives a correction to the dispersion relation of the transverse mode. In a strong magnetic field, we also show that the collective mode has a gap using the lowest Landau level approximation. We discuss the anomalous correction in the context of neutron star phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Gamma Ray Bursts with the Zir\`e instrument onboard the NUSES space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zir\`e experiment onboard NUSES space mission has several science goals, including the measurements of charged particles and light nuclei from few up to hundreds of MeVs, for the study of low-energy cosmic rays, space weather phenomena, and possible magnetosphere-lithosphere-ionosphere coupling signals. Furthermore, the experiment intends to test new tools for the detection of photons in the energy range of about 0.03-50 MeV, allowing the investigation of transient phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A high-density segmented calorimeter exploiting novel scintillator crystals and silicon photomultiplier technology for the readout system will serve this purpose along its main task of calorimetric energy measurement of the cosmic-ray charged particles. In this work, we discuss the functionality of the calorimeter as a GRB monitor through the calculation of its performance in terms of effective area, sensitivity, and timing response for the transient outbursts.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kalb-Ramond Gravity from EHT Observations of Rotating Black Holes in Traceless Conformal Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of rotating, charged black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a traceless (conformal) matter sector formed by ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics and a Kalb-Ramond two-form that spontaneously breaks local Lorentz symmetry. Starting from a family of obtained static, Schwarzschild-like solutions with a traceless Kalb-Ramond sector, we construct the stationary, axisymmetric counterpart via the Newman-Janis algorithm. The resulting Newman-Kerr-like metric depends on four intrinsic parameters: the electric charge $Q$, the ModMax nonlinearity $\gamma$, the Lorentz-violation amplitude $\ell$ and the spin $a$. We analyze horizon structure and separatrices in parameter space, derive the null geodesic equations and obtain the photon capture boundary that defines the black hole shadow. Using ray-tracing, we compute shadow silhouettes and a suite of shadow observables (areal radius, characteristic radius $R_s$, distortion $\delta$, oblateness $D$) and show how $\gamma$ and $\ell$ produce qualitatively distinct effects: $\gamma$ acts as a screening factor for the electromagnetic imprint, while $\ell$ introduces angular-dependent metric rescalings that deform shadow shape beyond simple size rescaling. We confront model predictions with EHT angular-radius measurements for M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ and derive conservative bounds on the combinations of $(Q,\gamma,\ell,a)$. Our results identify an effective charge combination $Q_{\rm eff}\simeq e^{-\gamma}Q^{2}/(1-\ell)^{2}$ and demonstrate that modest $Q_{\rm eff}$ remains compatible with current EHT images while large $Q_{\rm eff}$ is progressively disfavored.</description>

      <title>Investigation of hadronic cross sections of cosmic ray carbon and oxygen on BGO from 200 GeV to 10 TeV energy at the DAMPE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has made significant progress in measuring the fluxes of cosmic rays. These new measurements are pivotal in advancing our understanding of the origins and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. The bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) calorimeter plays a crucial role in these measurements, particularly in the precise determination of cosmic ray fluxes. However, for a calorimetric experiment like DAMPE, uncertainties in hadronic models persist as a major barrier in achieving more accurate measurements of fluxes of cosmic ray nuclei. This study centers on the measurement of the inelastic hadronic cross sections of carbon and oxygen nuclei interacting with BGO crystals target over an extensive energy range, spanning from 200 GeV to 10 TeV. For carbon nuclei interacting with the BGO target, the measurements of the cross sections have achieved a total relative uncertainty of less than 10% below 8 TeV for carbon, and below 3 TeV for oxygen. For oxygen nuclei, the same level of precision was attained below 3 TeV. Additionally, we compare the experimental results with Geant4 and FLUKA simulations to validate the accuracy and consistency of these simulation tools. Through comprehensive analysis of the inelastic hadronic interaction cross sections, this research provides validation for the hadronic interaction models used in DAMPE's cosmic-ray flux measurements.</description>

      <title>The Impact of ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ Reaction on the Evolution of He Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction is one of the most important reactions in the evolution of massive stars, yet its rate is still highly uncertain. In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\rm M_{\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Solar-Terrestrial Plasma and Magnetic Field on the Detection of Space-borne Gravitational Wave Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.</description>

      <title>Decaying vector dark matter with low reheating temperature for KM3NeT signal and its impact on gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</description>

      <title>eROSITA-selection of new period-bounce Cataclysmic Variables: First follow-up confirmation using TESS and SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Between 40$\%$ and 80$\%$ of cataclysmic variables (CVs) are expected to have evolved past the period-minimum and contain a degenerate donor. However, observational surveys for CVs have only been able to detect a few of these highly evolved "period-bouncers", most likely due to the intrinsic faintness associated with their predicted low mass accretion rates. We have produced an initial selection of 137 high-likelihood period-bounce candidates from WD catalog based on our multiwavelength period-bouncer scorecard and selection cuts including X-ray data from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). We have laid out three main requirements (classification as a CV, determination of an orbital period and detection of a very late-type donor) that should result in the confirmation of several of these candidates. Our path for confirming these candidates has already produced its first successful result with the confirmation of GALEX J125751.4-283015 as a new period-bouncer. Several other candidates have already fulfilled at least one of our three requirements making their future confirmation likely. Our search for period-bouncers using the X-ray eROSITA emission of objects in optical WD catalogs has led to the confirmation of six new period-bouncers identified from the Gaia DR3 WD catalog (five previously known CVs and one WD candidate), a 18$\%$ increase that brings the present population to 39 systems. Both the selection method for period-bounce candidates and the confirmation path that we outlined will aid in future searches for new period-bounce candidates, contributing to the goal of resolving the discrepancy between the predicted high number of period-bouncers and the low number of these systems successfully observed to date.</description>

Abstract: In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs, and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general case in which the second derivative of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We derive the gravitational field equations for the general power-law case and examine the cosmological implications of the scale-independent model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to an enhanced gravitational effects of radiation, does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Furthermore, we confront the model with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis, and discuss its potential to alleviate the Hubble tension by reducing the sound horizon. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Terzina Payload on NUSES: Silicon Photomultipliers Performance and Radiation Damage Mitigation in Low Earth Orbit</title>

Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are increasingly favored for detecting near-UV, visible, and infrared light in space due to their high sensitivity to single photons and compact design. While SiPMs offer several advantages over traditional photomultiplier tubes, their susceptibility to radiation and noise remains an issue. Our study intended to determine the optimal SiPM design for the Terzina Cherenkov satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550 km. To this end, we characterised several NUV-HD-MT SiPM variants, developed by Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and studied their responses to irradiation by exposing them to a 50 MeV proton beam and to electrons from the $\beta$-emitting source strontium-90. Experimental results were cross-validated with SPENVIS and Geant4 simulations. Based on our findings, we also propose an annealing strategy to mitigate radiation damage and ensure reliable performance in space-based applications.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in the Universe</title>

Abstract: The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background.
  In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Neutron star phase transition as the origin for the fast radio bursts and soft gamma-ray repeaters of SGR J1935+2154</title>

Abstract: Magnetars are believed as neutron stars (NSs) with strong magnetic fields. X-ray flares and fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed from the magnetar (soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR J1935+2154). We propose that the phase transition of the NS can power the FRBs and SGRs.Based on the equation of state provided by the MIT bag model and the mean field approximation, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to get the NS structure. With spin-down of the NS, the hadronic shell gradually transfers to the quark shell.The gravitational potential energy released by one time of the phase transition can be achieved. The released energy, time interval between two successive phase transitions, and glitch are all consistent with the observations of the FRBs and the X-ray flares from SGR J1935+2154. We conclude that the phase transition of an NS is a plausible mechanism to power the SGRs as well as the repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Dual Jet Interaction, Magnetically Arrested Flows, and Flares in Accreting Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes in galactic centers are potential multimessenger sources in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation. To find such objects, isolating unique electromagnetic signatures of their accretion flow is key. With the aid of three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that utilize an approximate, semi-analytic, super-imposed spacetime metric, we identify two such signatures for merging binaries. Both involve magnetic reconnection and are analogous to plasma processes observed in the solar corona. The first, like colliding flux tubes that can cause solar flares, involves colliding jets that form an extended reconnection layer, dissipating magnetic energy and causing the two jets to merge. The second, akin to coronal mass ejection events, involves the accretion of magnetic field lines onto both black holes; these magnetic fields then twist, inflate, and form a trailing current sheet, ultimately reconnecting and driving a hot outflow. We provide estimates for the associated electromagnetic emission for both processes, showing that they likely accelerate electrons to high energies and are promising candidates for continuous, stochastic, and/or quasi-periodic higher energy electromagnetic emission. We also show that the accretion flows around each black hole can display features associated with the magnetically arrested state. However, simulations with black hole spins misaligned with the orbital plane and simulations with larger Bondi radii saturate at lower values of horizon-penetrating magnetic flux than standard magnetically arrested disks, leading to weaker, intermittent jets due to feedback from the weak jets or equatorial flux tubes ejected by reconnecting field lines near the horizon.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>

Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90 GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z=0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5\pm0.6\times10^{15}$ M$_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large-scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method to model the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24\pm4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and is spatially closely correlated with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. We characterize a potential shock candidate at the cluster center, based on the sharp temperature and pressure gradient, and quantify its temperature-derived Mach number in various directions to span a range of $M = (1.7 - 2.0) \pm 0.3$. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $3.1_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ keV and a density $(3.78\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim400$ relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim6.1\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim(6.8\pm2.7)\times10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory from Accelerating Relativistic Jets in Multiple Thick Shell Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) memory, a permanent distortion of the space-time metric, is anticipated during the acceleration of relativistic jets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). While the precise mechanism behind GRBs is not yet fully understood, detecting GW memory may contribute to clarifying their nature. In this paper, we consider various scenarios of GW memory emission, including both single and multiple shells with thin- and thick-shells. In particular, the memory spectrum for each scenario is compared with the sensitivity of next-generation detectors, namely DECIGO and ET-D. Physical properties spread over a broad-band region, emphasizing the importance of combined and wide-band observations. We also simulate GW memory based on nearby, realistic scenarios and demonstrate its detectability.</description>

      <title>Observing radio transients with Phased ALMA: Pulses from the Galactic Centre magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06234v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.</description>

Abstract: The rising phase of the 2023-24 outburst of the recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 was monitored by {\it Insight}-HXMT. We study the evolution of hard ($4$-150$ keV) and soft ($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), QPO frequencies, and spectral features using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments between August 25 and October 5, 2023. The QPO frequency is found to be strongly correlated with the soft-band X-ray count rates, and spectral photon indices. In contrast, a strong anti-correlation is observed between HR and QPO frequency, as well as between HR and photon index. Based on the evolution of the temporal and spectral properties, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six parts. The evolution of the QPOs in parts 1-5 is fitted with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective. An inward-propagating shock with weakening strength (except in part 4) is observed during the period of our study. The probable mass of the source is estimated to be $13.5 \pm 1.9~M_\odot$ using the QPO frequency ($\nu$)-photon index ($\Gamma$) scaling method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but with zero net strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.</description>

      <title>Triggering Electron Capture Supernovae: Dark Matter Effects in Degenerate White-Dwarf-like Cores of Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Collapsar Outflows: Structure, Signatures and Origins of Einstein Probe Relativistic Supernova Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a "top-hat" geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.</description>

      <title>Testing Magnetic Field Configurations in Spider Pulsar PSR J1723-2837 with IXPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetry observations of a redback millisecond pulsar binary, PSR J1723-2837, with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We conduct a spectro-polarimetric analysis combining IXPE data with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift observations. We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the {\tt 3DPol} radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole. We find no significant detection of polarization in the IXPE data, with PD&lt;50% at 99% confidence level. Our results excludes the high-polarization degree scenario predicted by the perpendicular field model during the brightest orbital phase bin. Simulations show that doubling the current exposure would make the parallel configuration detectable. The new PA rotation technique is also applicable to IXPE data of many sources whose intrinsic PA variation is apriori not known but is strictly periodic.</description>

      <title>Towards systematic searches for LISA white dwarf binaries with multiband photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-compact double white dwarfs (DWDs) represent key targets for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they may be observed both through gravitational waves and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000${\AA} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact and analytical solution in General Relativity describing an equilibrium configuration for two stationary black holes. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed in an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta and the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic neutrinos as probes of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of extremely energetic cosmic rays with both cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light, can produce $\mathcal{O}(10^{18} \,{\rm eV})$ neutrinos, known as cosmogenic neutrinos. These neutrinos are the only messengers from the extreme cosmic accelerators that can reveal the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to achieving their detection. In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar \nu_\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model physics. We identify three well-motivated scenarios which induce distinct features in the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum at Earth: neutrino self-interactions mediated by a light scalar ($\nu$SI), pseudo-Dirac neutrinos (PD$\nu$) and neutrinos scattering on ultra-light Dark Matter ($\nu$DM). We show these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic neutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current experiments. For the $\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the coupling to $\nu_\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass in the range 0.1 to 1 GeV. For PD$\nu$, we find that GRAND is sensitive to sterile-active mass squared splitting in the range [$10^{-15},10^{-13}$] ${\rm eV}^2$. Finally, for the $\nu$DM model, assuming a heavy mediator, GRAND can do substantially better than the current limits from other available data. These results rely on the fact that the actual cosmogenic flux is around the corner, not far from the current IceCube limit.</description>

      <title>Taming systematics in distance and inclination measurements with gravitational waves: role of the detector network and higher-order modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of compact binaries have the potential to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance and inclination. However, these parameters are strongly correlated when performing parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW astronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian inference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned second-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer Einstein Telescope~(ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor, detector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this degeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in particular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as long as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.</description>

      <title>Variability in the supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSS J2320+0024: No evidence of periodic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, and they are expected to be among the loudest gravitational-wave sources at low frequencies. The source SDSS J2320+0024 was recently proposed as a promising SBHB candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light curve and variability in the MgII emission line. In this work, we reanalysed the optical (g, r, and i bands) light curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection. When periodicity was searched for together with red noise, analysis of the g-band light curve reveals a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days. The posterior profile is too broad to yield a preference for periodic models over models that include only red noise. Furthermore, the same peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band and i-band light curve. A periodic model without red noise identified a different (~1100 days) periodicity, but this model is statistically significantly disfavoured relative to the other models tested. In summary, we find no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal over red-noise variability. Our analysis questions the robustness of the previously proposed periodicity and emphasises the importance of rigorous statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis of the photometric light curves and evolving broad-line profiles would shed further light on the true nature of this object.</description>

      <title>Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>
