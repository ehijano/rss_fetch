      <title>Cohomological Mackey formula for quotient stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a restriction morphism on the critical cohomology of an equivariant Landau-Ginzburg model associated to a representation of a reductive group equipped with an invariant function. We show a compatibility formula between the restriction and induction maps as a Mackey-type formula, thereby giving the critical cohomology the structure of a localized induction-restriction system.</description>

      <title>Shuffle Products, Degenerate Affine Hecke Algebras, and Quantum Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit an identification of the quantum Toda lattice for $\mathrm{GL}_N$ and the truncated shifted Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, as well as related constructions, from a purely algebraic point of view, bypassing the topological medium of the homology of the affine Grassmannian. For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</description>

      <title>The Anti-Unitarity of Time Reversal &amp; Co-representations of Lorentzian Pin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the representation theory of Lorentzian orthogonal groups, there are well known arguments as to why the parity inversion operator $\mathcal{P}$ and the time reversal operator $\mathcal{T}$, should be realized as linear and anti-linear operators respectively (Wigner 1932). Despite this, standard constructions of double covers of the Lorentzian orthogonal groups naturally build time reversal operators in such a manner that they are linear, and the anti-linearity is put in ad-hoc after the fact. This article introduces a viewpoint naturally incorporating the anti-linearity into the construction of these double covers, through what Wigner called co-representations, a kind of semi-linear representation. It is shown how the standard spinoral double covers of the Lorentz group -- $\operatorname{Pin}(1,3)$ and $\operatorname{Pin}(3,1)$ -- may be naturally centrally extended for this purpose, and the relationship between the $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{P}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ operators is discussed. Additionally a mapping is constructed demonstrating an interesting equivalence between Majorana and Weyl spinors. Finally a co-representation is built for the de Sitter group $\operatorname{Pin}(1,4)$, and it is demonstrated how a theory with this symmetry has no truly scalar fermion mass terms.</description>

      <title>Cut Groups: The Progress And The Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the study of cut groups, i.e., the groups which have only trivial central units in their integral group ring. We provide state of art for cut groups. The results are compiled in a systematic manner and have also been analogously studied for some generalised classes, such as quadratic rational groups and semi-rational groups etc. For these bigger classes, some results have been extended, while others have been posed as questions. The progress and the problems signify the development and the potential that holds in the topic of cut groups and its generalisations.</description>

      <title>Valuative independence and cluster theta reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that theta functions constructed from positive scattering diagrams satisfy valuative independence. That is, for certain valuations $\operatorname{val}_{v}$, we have $\operatorname{val}_v(\sum_u c_u \vartheta_u)=\min_{c_u\neq 0} \operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)$. As applications, we prove linear independence of theta functions with specialized coefficients and characterize when theta functions for cluster varieties are unchanged by the unfreezing of an index. This yields a general gluing result for theta functions from moduli of local systems on marked surfaces. We then prove that theta functions for cluster varieties satisfy a symmetry property called theta reciprocity: briefly, $\operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)=\operatorname{val}_u(\vartheta_v)$. For this we utilize a new framework called a "seed datum" for understanding cluster-type varieties. One may apply valuative independence and theta reciprocity together to identify theta function bases for global sections of line bundles on partial compactifications of cluster varieties.</description>

      <title>Purity, ascent, and periodicity for Gorenstein flat cotorsion modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate purity within the Frobenius category of Gorenstein flat cotorsion modules, which can be seen as an infinitely generated analogue of the Frobenius category of Gorenstein projective objects. As such, the associated stable category can be viewed as an alternative approach to a big singularity category, which is equivalent to Krause's when the ring is Gorenstein.
  We study the pure structure of the stable category, and show it is fundamentally related to the pure structure of the Gorenstein flat modules. Following that, we give conditions for extension of scalars to preserve Gorenstein flat cotorsion modules. In this case, one obtains an induced triangulated functor on the stable categories. We show that under mild conditions that these functors preserve the pure structure, both on the triangulated and module category level.
  Along the way, we consider particular phenomena over commutative rings, the cumulation of which is an extension of Kn\"{o}rrer periodicity, giving a triangulated equivalence between Krause's big singularity categories for a complete hypersurface singularity and its twofold double-branched cover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains two main results. First, we provide combinatorial branching rules for $\text{GL}_n \downarrow \text{O}_n$ and $\text{GL}_{2n} \downarrow \text{Sp}_{2n}$ extending the Littlewood restriction rules. Second, we use these branching rules and the combinatorics of $\text{GL}_n$-crystals to derive a formula for the graded multiplicity of a $K$-type in the regular functions on the $K$-nilpotent cone for $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$, $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ and $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{H})$. Due to work of Schmid and Vilonen, these graded multiplicities determine the Hodge $K$-character of the spherical principal series with infinitesimal character 0.</description>

      <title>Higher hereditary algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras arising from some toric singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graded and ungraded singularity categories of some commutative Gorenstein toric singularities, namely, Veronese subrings of polynomial rings, and Segre products of some copies of polynomial rings. We show that the graded singularity category has a tilting object whose endomorphism ring is higher representation infinite. Moreover, we construct the tilting object so that the endomorphism ring has a strict root pair of its higher Auslander-Reiten translation, which allows us to give equivalences between singularity categories and (folded) cluster categories in a such a way that their cluster tilting objects correspond to each other. Our distinguished form of tilting objects also allows us to construct (twisted) Calabi-Yau algebras as the Calabi-Yau completions of the root pairs. We give an explicit description of these twisted Calabi-Yau algebras as well as the higher representation infinite algebras in terms of quivers and relations. Along the way, we prove that certain idempotent quotients of higher representation infinite algebras remain higher representation infinite.</description>

      <title>Extriangulated length categories: torsion classes and $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of extriangulated length categories, whose prototypical examples include abelian length categories and bounded derived categories of finite dimensional algebras with finite global dimension. We prove that an extriangulated category $\mathcal{A}$ is a length category if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ admits a simple-minded system. Subsequently, we study the partially ordered set ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ of torsion classes in an extriangulated length category $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ from the perspective of lattice theory. It is shown that ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ forms a complete lattice, which is further proved to be completely semidistributive and algebraic. Moreover, we describe the arrows in the Hasse quiver of ${\rm tor}_{\Theta}(\mathcal{A})$ using brick labeling. Finally, we introduce the concepts of support torsion classes and support $\tau$-tilting subcategories in extriangulated length categories and establish a bijection between these two notions, thereby generalizing the Adachi-Iyama-Reiten bijection for functorially finite torsion classes.</description>

      <title>The Green correspondence for SL(2,p)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${p &gt; 2}$ be an odd prime and ${G = SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)}$. Denote the subgroup of upper triangular matrices as $B$. Finally, let ${\mathbb{F}}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic ${p}$. The Green correspondence gives a bijection between the non-projective indecomposable ${\mathbb{F}[G]}$ modules and non-projective indecomposable ${\mathbb{F}[B]}$ modules, realised by restriction and induction. In this paper, we start by recalling a suitable description of the non-projective indecomposable modules for these group algebras. Next, we explicitly describe the Green correspondence bijection by pinpointing the modules' position on the Stable Auslanden-Reiten quivers. Finally, we obtain two corollaries in terms of these descriptions: formulae for lifting the ${\mathbb{F}[B]}$ module decomposition of an ${\mathbb{F}[G]}$ module, and a complete description of ${\text{Ind}_B^G}$ and ${\text{Res}^G_B}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of the root systems $R(m)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a reduced irreducible root system, $h$ its Coxeter number and $m$ a positive integer smaller than $h$. Choose of base of $R$, whence a corresponding height function, and let $R(m)$ be the set of roots whose height is a multiple of $m$. In a recent paper, S. Nadimpalli, S. Pattanayak and D. Prasad studied, for the purposes of character theory at torsion elements, the root systems $R(m)$; in particular, they introduced a constant $d_m$ which is always the dimension of a representation of the semisimple, simply-connected group with root system dual to $R(m)$ and equals $1$ if the roots of height $m$ form a base of $R(m)$, and proved this property when $R$ is of type $A$ or $C$, and also in type $B$ if $m$ is odd. In this paper, we complete their analysis by determining a base of $R(m)$ and computing the constant $d_m$ in all cases.</description>

      <title>Limit Profiles for Reversible Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.13437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Teyssier [Tey20] introduced a new method for approximating the distance from equilibrium of a random walk on a group. He used it to study the limit profile for the random transpositions card shuffle. His techniques were restricted to conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups; we derive similar approximation lemmas for random walks on homogeneous spaces and for general reversible Markov chains. We illustrate applications of these lemmas to some famous problems: the $k$-cycle shuffle, improving results of Hough [Hou16] and Berestycki, Schramm and Zeitouni [BSZ11]; the Ehrenfest urn diffusion with many urns, improving results of Ceccherini-Silberstein, Scarabotti and Tolli [CST07]; a Gibbs sampler, which is a fundamental tool in statistical physics, with Binomial prior and hypergeometric posterior, improving results of Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste [DKS08].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. We show the complete prime spectrum is functorial and give a characterization of when a monoidal exact functor induces a well-defined map on noncommutative Balmer spectra. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>
