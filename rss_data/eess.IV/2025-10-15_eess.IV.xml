      <title>Approximate Bilevel Graph Structure Learning for Histopathology Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and spatial arrangements of cells within tissues represent their functional states, making graph-based learning highly suitable for histopathology image analysis. Existing methods often rely on fixed graphs with predefined edges, limiting their ability to capture the true biological complexity of tissue interactions. In this work, we propose ABiG-Net (Approximate Bilevel Optimization for Graph Structure Learning via Neural Networks), a novel framework designed to learn optimal interactions between patches within whole slide images (WSI) or large regions of interest (ROI) while simultaneously learning discriminative node embeddings for the downstream image classification task. Our approach hierarchically models the tissue architecture at local and global scales. At the local scale, we construct patch-level graphs from cellular orientation within each patch and extract features to quantify local structures. At the global scale, we learn an image-level graph that captures sparse, biologically meaningful connections between patches through a first-order approximate bilevel optimization strategy. The learned global graph is optimized in response to classification performance, capturing the long-range contextual dependencies across the image. By unifying local structural information with global contextual relationships, ABiG-Net enhances interpretability and downstream performance. Experiments on two histopathology datasets demonstrate its effectiveness: on the Extended CRC dataset, ABiG-Net achieves 97.33 $\pm$ 1.15 % accuracy for three-class colorectal cancer grading and 98.33 $\pm$ 0.58 % for binary classification; on the melanoma dataset, it attains 96.27 $\pm$ 0.74 % for tumor-lymphocyte ROI classification.</description>

      <title>DIGITWISE: Digital Twin-based Modeling of Adaptive Video Streaming Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the popularity of video streaming entertainment continues to grow, understanding how users engage with the content and react to its changes becomes a critical success factor for every stakeholder. User engagement, i.e., the percentage of video the user watches before quitting, is central to customer loyalty, content personalization, ad relevance, and A/B testing. This paper presents DIGITWISE, a digital twin-based approach for modeling adaptive video streaming engagement. Traditional adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms assume that all users react similarly to video streaming artifacts and network issues, neglecting individual user sensitivities. DIGITWISE leverages the concept of a digital twin, a digital replica of a physical entity, to model user engagement based on past viewing sessions. The digital twin receives input about streaming events and utilizes supervised machine learning to predict user engagement for a given session. The system model consists of a data processing pipeline, machine learning models acting as digital twins, and a unified model to predict engagement. DIGITWISE employs the XGBoost model in both digital twins and unified models. The proposed architecture demonstrates the importance of personal user sensitivities, reducing user engagement prediction error by up to 5.8% compared to non-user-aware models. Furthermore, DIGITWISE can optimize content provisioning and delivery by identifying the features that maximize engagement, providing an average engagement increase of up to 8.6%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic video communication is considered a paradigm shift in visual communications, becoming increasingly popular for its ability to offer immersive experiences. This article provides an overview of holographic video communication and outlines the requirements of a holographic video communication system. Particularly, following a brief review of semantic com- munication, an architecture for a semantic-enabled holographic video communication system is presented. Key technologies, including semantic sampling, joint semantic-channel coding, and semantic-aware transmission, are designed based on the proposed architecture. Two related use cases are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed methods. Finally, potential research topics are discussed to pave the way for the realization of semantic-enabled holographic video communications.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Wireless DJSCC Symbols to Rate Constrained Wired Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has emerged as a robust alternative to traditional separate coding for communications through wireless channels. Existing DJSCC approaches focus primarily on point-to-point wireless communication scenarios, while neglecting end-to-end communication efficiency in hybrid wireless-wired networks such as 5G and 6G communication systems. Considerable redundancy in DJSCC symbols against wireless channels becomes inefficient for long-distance wired transmission. Furthermore, DJSCC symbols must adapt to the varying transmission rate of the wired network to avoid congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed for efficient wired transmission of DJSCC symbols within hybrid wireless-wired networks, namely Rate-Controllable Wired Adaptor (RCWA). RCWA achieves redundancy-aware coding for DJSCC symbols to improve transmission efficiency, which removes considerable redundancy present in DJSCC symbols for wireless channels and encodes only source-relevant information into bits. Moreover, we leverage the Lagrangian multiplier method to achieve controllable and continuous variable-rate coding, which can encode given features into expected rates, thereby minimizing end-to-end distortion while satisfying given constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior RD performance and robustness of RCWA compared to existing baselines, validating its potential for wired resource utilization in hybrid transmission scenarios. Specifically, our method can obtain peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of up to 0.7dB and 4dB compared to neural network-based methods and digital baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dedelayed: Deleting remote inference delay via on-device correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms. Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain aligned with the current world state.</description>

      <title>Invited Paper: BitMedViT: Ternary-Quantized Vision Transformer for Medical AI Assistants on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in interpreting complex medical imaging data. However, their significant computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices used in clinical environments. We introduce, BiTMedViT, a new class of Edge ViTs serving as medical AI assistants that perform structured analysis of medical images directly on the edge. BiTMedViT utilizes ternary- quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and com- bines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BiTMedViT employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BiTMedViT achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43x, memory traffic by 39x, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41x that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano. Our results demonstrate a practical and scientifically grounded route for extreme-precision medical imaging ViTs deployable on the edge, narrowing the gap between algorithmic advances and deployable clinical tools.</description>

      <title>Robust Real-Time Endoscopic Stereo Matching under Fuzzy Tissue Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time acquisition of accurate scene depth is essential for automated robotic minimally invasive surgery. Stereo matching with binocular endoscopy can provide this depth information. However, existing stereo matching methods, designed primarily for natural images, often struggle with endoscopic images due to fuzzy tissue boundaries and typically fail to meet real-time requirements for high-resolution endoscopic image inputs. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RRESM}, a real-time stereo matching method tailored for endoscopic images. Our approach integrates a 3D Mamba Coordinate Attention module that enhances cost aggregation through position-sensitive attention maps and long-range spatial dependency modeling via the Mamba block, generating a robust cost volume without substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a High-Frequency Disparity Optimization module that refines disparity predictions near tissue boundaries by amplifying high-frequency details in the wavelet domain. Evaluations on the SCARED and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art matching accuracy with a real-time inference speed of 42 FPS. The code is available at https://github.com/Sonne-Ding/RRESM.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Semantic Preservation in Text-Aware Image Compression Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional image compression methods aim to reconstruct images for human perception, prioritizing visual fidelity over task relevance. In contrast, Coding for Machines focuses on preserving information essential for automated understanding. Building on this principle, we present an end-to-end compression framework that retains text-specific features for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The encoder operates at roughly half the computational cost of the OCR module, making it suitable for resource-limited devices. When on-device OCR is infeasible, images can be efficiently compressed and later decoded to recover textual content. Experiments show significant improvements in text extraction accuracy at low bitrates, even outperforming OCR on uncompressed images.
  We further extend this study to general-purpose encoders, exploring their capacity to preserve hidden semantics under extreme compression. Instead of optimizing for visual fidelity, we examine whether compact, visually degraded representations can retain recoverable meaning through learned enhancement and recognition modules. Results demonstrate that semantic information can persist despite severe compression, bridging text-oriented compression and general-purpose semantic preservation in machine-centered image coding.</description>

      <title>Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many imaging modalities involve reconstruction of unknown objects from collections of noisy projections related by random rotations. In one of these modalities, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) makes integration of information from multiple images crucial. Existing approaches to cryo-EM processing, however, either rely on handcrafted priors or apply deep learning only on select portions of the pipeline, such as particle picking, micrograph denoising, or refinement. A fully end-to-end reconstruction approach requires a neural network architecture that integrates information from multiple images while respecting the rotational symmetry of the measurement process. In this work, we introduce the polar transformer, a new neural network architecture that combines polar representations and transformers along with a convolutional attention mechanism that preserves the rotational symmetry of the problem. We apply it to the particle-level denoising problem, where it is able to learn discriminative features in the images, enabling optimal clustering, alignment, and denoising. On simulated datasets, this achieves up to a $2\times$ reduction in mean squared error (MSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $0.02$, suggesting new opportunities for data-driven approaches to reconstruction in cryo-EM and related tomographic modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a novel paradigm for signal representation that have attracted considerable interest for image compression. INRs offer unprecedented advantages in signal resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new possibilities for compression techniques. However, the existing limitations of INRs for image compression have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. In this work, we explore the critical yet overlooked limiting factors of INRs, such as computational cost, unstable performance, and robustness. Through extensive experiments and empirical analysis, we provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of implicit neural image compression methods such as Fourier Feature Networks and Siren. Our work also offers valuable insights for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>VRS-UIE: Value-Driven Reordering Scanning for Underwater Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising backbone for vision tasks due to their linear complexity and global receptive field. However, in the context of Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE), the standard sequential scanning mechanism is fundamentally challenged by the unique statistical distribution characteristics of underwater scenes. The predominance of large-portion, homogeneous but useless oceanic backgrounds can dilute the feature representation responses of sparse yet valuable targets, thereby impeding effective state propagation and compromising the model's ability to preserve both local semantics and global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Value-Driven Reordering Scanning framework for UIE, termed VRS-UIE. Its core innovation is a Multi-Granularity Value Guidance Learning (MVGL) module that generates a pixel-aligned value map to dynamically reorder the SSM's scanning sequence. This prioritizes informative regions to facilitate the long-range state propagation of salient features. Building upon the MVGL, we design a Mamba-Conv Mixer (MCM) block that synergistically integrates priority-driven global sequencing with dynamically adjusted local convolutions, thereby effectively modeling both large-portion oceanic backgrounds and high-value semantic targets. A Cross-Feature Bridge (CFB) further refines multi-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VRS-UIE framework sets a new state-of-the-art, delivering superior enhancement performance (surpassing WMamba by 0.89 dB on average) by effectively suppressing water bias and preserving structural and color fidelity. Furthermore, by incorporating efficient convolutional operators and resolution rescaling, we construct a light-weight yet effective scheme, VRS-UIE-S, suitable for real-time UIE applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern photon-counting sensors are increasingly dominated by Poisson noise, yet conventional Feature-Specific Imaging (FSI) is optimized for additive Gaussian noise, leading to suboptimal performance and a loss of its advantages under Poisson noise. To address this, we introduce DeepFSI, a novel end-to-end optical-electronic framework. DeepFSI "unfreezes" traditional FSI masks, enabling a deep neural network to learn globally optimal measurement masks by computing gradients directly under realistic Poisson and additive noise conditions. Our simulations demonstrate DeepFSI's superior feature fidelity and task performance compared to conventional FSI with predefined masks, especially in Poisson-Noise-dominant environments. DeepFSI also exhibits enhanced robustness to design choices and performs well under additive Gaussian noise, representing a significant advance for noise-robust computational imaging in photon-limited applications.</description>

      <title>QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility.</description>
