      <title>Aircraft Conflict Detection and Avoidance through Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical problem of tracking a maneuvering aircraft during flight has always been a crucial task in order to safeguard airborne assets from unknown threats. Therefore, the need for an efficient target detection and identification technique is substantial and growing. The multiple model (MM) estimation have proven to be one of the most reliable and accurate among various filtering algorithms. In this paper we will implement the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimation technique for the aforementioned purpose of target identification. This target's motion, though defined by predefined dynamics, is obscured due to the noises from tracking sensors. The algorithm intends to predict the location of target and provide feedback maneuver to the reference aircraft in order to avoid a conflict.</description>

      <title>Safe Control of Grid-Interfacing Inverters with Current Magnitude Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-interfacing inverters allow renewable resources to be connected to the electric grid and offer fast and programmable control responses. However, inverters are subject to significant physical constraints. One such constraint is a current magnitude limit required to protect semiconductor devices. While many current limiting methods are available, they can often unpredictably alter the behavior of the inverter control during overcurrent events leading to instability or poor performance.
  In this paper, we present a safety filter approach to limit the current magnitude of inverters controlled as voltage sources. The safety filter problem is formulated with a control barrier function constraint that encodes the current magnitude limit. To ensure feasibility of the problem, we prove the existence of a safe linear controller for a specified reference. This approach allows for the desired voltage source behavior to be minimally altered while safely limiting the current output.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Linearizable Power Flow for Large-scale Grid Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective power flow (PF) modeling critically affects the solution accuracy and computation complexity of large-scale grid optimization problems. Especially for grid optimization with varying topologies for enhanced flexibility and resilience, a tractable approximation of nonlinear AC-PF is of paramount importance. This work develops a data-driven approach to obtain piecewise linear (PWL) PF models by using the ReLU activation and an innovative neural network (NN) layer design to match the generative structure of AC-PF models like nodal power balance. Accordingly, the proposed generative NN (GenNN) PF model not only maintains the consistency among the predicted power variables but also neatly includes the topology decision variables for attaining a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) based reformulation of grid topology optimization problems. We further develop an area-partitioning based sparsification method to reduce the number of GenNN weight parameters and thus the model complexity. Thanks to our sparse GenNN, the proposed PWL-PF can achieve scalability for large-scale systems and allow for efficient solutions of AC-PF based optimal transmission switching (OTS) and restoration order problems (ROP). Numerical tests on the IEEE 118-bus and the 6716-bus synthetic Texas grid systems have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in approximating the AC-PF and accelerating topology optimization solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive bias for dissensus in nonlinear opinion dynamics with application to evolutionary division of labor games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the intricate effects of wind power integration on the Available Transfer Capability (ATC) of power systems, emphasizing the significance of spatiotemporal correlations in wind speed. We present an innovative optimal power flow model that integrates the Primal-Dual Interior Point Method (PDIPM), ensuring both computational accuracy and efficiency. This research pioneers a systematic analysis of how spatiotemporal wind speed correlations influence wind power output, thereby refining ATC calculations and improving prediction reliability. Furthermore, we assess the impacts of wind farm integration capacity, location, and connection methods on ATC, offering valuable insights for power system planning and market operations.</description>

      <title>Combining Switching Mechanism with Re-Initialization and Anomaly Detection for Resiliency of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a pivotal role in numerous critical real-world applications that have stringent requirements for safety. To enhance the CPS resiliency against attacks, redundancy can be integrated in real-time controller implementations by designing strategies that switch among multiple controllers. However, existing switching strategies typically overlook remediation measures for compromised controllers, opting instead to simply exclude them. Such a solution reduces the CPS redundancy since only a subset of controllers are used. To address this gap, this work proposes a multi-controller switching strategy with periodic re-initialization to remove attacks. Controllers that finish re-initialization can be reused by the switching strategy, preserving the CPS redundancy and resiliency. The proposed switching strategy is designed to ensure that at each switching moment, a controller that has just completed re-initialization is available, minimizing the likelihood of compromise. Additionally, the controller's working period decreases with the number of involved controllers, reducing the controller's exposure time to attacks. An anomaly detector is used to detect CPS attacks during the controller's working period. Upon alarm activation, the current control signal is set to a predefined value, and a switch to an alternative controller occurs at the earliest switching moment. Our switching strategy is shown to be still effective even if the anomaly detector fails to detect (stealthy) attacks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Contingency for Nuclear Electrical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the use of contingency analysis for a nuclear power plant to determine its potential benefits for the nuclear industry. Various N-1 contingencies were analyzed for a model of an existing nuclear plant, primarily inspecting voltage violations resulting from a failure. Remedial Actions Schemes were suggested to support the reduction of voltage violations in the event of a failure within the system. Many of the schemes presented were solved by existing redundancies and protection schemes that have been provided through the use of industry standard bounding analysis in the design process. This paper proposes the future use of real-time contingency analysis for nuclear power plants, conducted using constantly updating voltage, current, and power measurements through the system. This will provide real-time information of the system and can serve as historical data to reduce the analysis needed for pending design changes in the plant.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-Driven Tube-Based Zonotopic Predictive Control with Closed-Loop Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a robust data-driven tube-based zonotopic predictive control (TZPC) approach for discrete-time linear systems, designed to ensure stability and recursive feasibility in the presence of bounded noise. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In an initial learning phase, we provide an over-approximation of all models consistent with past input and noisy state data using zonotope properties. Subsequently, in a control phase, we formulate an optimization problem, which by integrating terminal ingredients is proven to be recursively feasible. Moreover, we prove that implementing this data-driven predictive control approach guarantees robust exponential stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and competitive performance of the proposed control strategy, compared to recent data-driven predictive control methods, are illustrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Testing of Autonomous Vehicles with Scenario Similarity Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing and evaluation are critical to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Given the rarity of safety-critical events such as crashes, millions of tests are typically needed to accurately assess AV safety performance. Although techniques like importance sampling can accelerate this process, it usually still requires too many numbers of tests for field testing. This severely hinders the testing and evaluation process, especially for third-party testers and governmental bodies with very limited testing budgets. The rapid development cycles of AV technology further exacerbate this challenge. To fill this research gap, this paper introduces the few-shot testing (FST) problem and proposes a methodological framework to tackle it. As the testing budget is very limited, usually smaller than 100, the FST method transforms the testing scenario generation problem from probabilistic sampling to deterministic optimization, reducing the uncertainty of testing results. To optimize the selection of testing scenarios, a cross-attention similarity mechanism is proposed to learn to extract the information of AV's testing scenario space. This allows iterative searches for scenarios with the smallest evaluation error, ensuring precise testing within budget constraints. Experimental results in cut-in scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the FST method, significantly enhancing accuracy and enabling efficient, precise AV testing.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach for Learning the Dynamics of Power System Generators and Inverter-based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for renewable energy integration and electrification greatly challenges power system dynamic analysis. To account for both synchronous generators (SGs) and IBRs, this work presents an approach for learning the model of an individual dynamic component. The recurrent neural network (RNN) model is used to match the recursive structure in predicting the key dynamical states of a component from its terminal bus voltage and set-point input. To deal with the fast transients especially due to IBRs, we develop a Stable Integral (SI-)RNN to mimic high-order integral methods that can enhance the stability and accuracy for the dynamic learning task. We demonstrate that the proposed SI-RNN model not only can successfully predict the component's dynamic behaviors, but also offers the possibility of efficiently computing the dynamic sensitivity relative to a set-point change. These capabilities have been numerically validated based on full-order Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations on a small test system with both SGs and IBRs, particularly for predicting the dynamics of grid-forming inverters.</description>

      <title>A Review of Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Multi-Agent Frameworks for Distributed Energy Resource Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) are gaining prominence due to their advantages in improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing grid resilience. Despite the increasing deployment, the potential of DERs has yet to be fully explored and exploited. A fundamental question restrains the management of numerous DERs in large-scale power systems, "How should DER data be securely processed and DER operations be efficiently optimized?" To address this question, this paper considers two critical issues, namely privacy for processing DER data and scalability in optimizing DER operations, then surveys existing and emerging solutions from a multi-agent framework perspective. In the context of scalability, this paper reviews state-of-the-art research that relies on parallel control, optimization, and learning within distributed and/or decentralized information exchange structures, while in the context of privacy, it identifies privacy preservation measures that can be synthesized into the aforementioned scalable structures. Despite research advances in these areas, challenges remain because these highly interdisciplinary studies blend a wide variety of scalable computing architectures and privacy preservation techniques from different fields, making them difficult to adapt in practice. To mitigate this issue, this paper provides a holistic review of trending strategies that orchestrate privacy and scalability for large-scale power system operations from a multi-agent perspective, particularly for DER control problems. Furthermore, this review extrapolates new approaches for future scalable, privacy-aware, and cybersecure pathways to unlock the full potential of DERs through controlling, optimizing, and learning generic multi-agent-based cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Primal-Dual Interior Point Framework for Analyzing Infeasible Combined Transmission and Distribution Grid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of distributed energy resources has heightened the interactions between transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) systems, necessitating novel analyses for the reliable operation and planning of interconnected T&amp;D networks. A critical gap is an analysis approach that identifies and localizes the weak spots in the combined T\&amp;D networks, providing valuable information to system planners and operators. The research goal is to efficiently model and simulate infeasible (i.e. unsolvable in general settings) combined positive sequence transmission and three-phase distribution networks with a unified solution algorithm. We model the combined T&amp;D network with the equivalent circuit formulation. To solve the overall T&amp;D network, we build a Gauss-Jacobi-Newton (GJN) based distributed primal dual interior point optimization algorithm capable of isolating weak nodes. We validate the approach on large combined T&amp;D networks with 70k+ T and 15k+ D nodes and demonstrate performance improvement over the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Deployment of NILM Systems: Challenges and Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), as a key load monitoring technology, can much reduce the deployment cost of traditional power sensors. Previous research has largely focused on developing cloud-exclusive NILM algorithms, which often result in high computation costs and significant service delays. To address these issues, we propose a three-tier framework to enhance the real-world applicability of NILM systems through edge-cloud collaboration. Considering the computational resources available at both the edge and cloud, we implement a lightweight NILM model at the edge and a deep learning based model at the cloud, respectively. In addition to the differential model implementations, we also design a NILM-specific deployment scheme that integrates Gunicorn and NGINX to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical applications. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply real-world NILM scenario settings and implement the entire process of data acquisition, model training, and system deployment. The results demonstrate that our framework can achieve high decomposition accuracy while significantly reducing the cloud workload and communication overhead under practical considerations.</description>

      <title>A Contract Theory for Layered Control Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems typically leverage layered control architectures with a combination of discrete and continuous models operating at different timescales. As a result, layered systems form a new class of hybrid systems composed of systems operating on a diverse set of continuous and discrete signals. This paper formalizes the notion of a layered (hierarchical) control architecture through a theory of relations between its layers. This theory enables us to formulate contracts within layered control systems -- these define interfaces between layers and isolate the design of each layer, guaranteeing that composition of contracts at each layer results in a contract capturing the desired system-wide specification. Thus, the proposed theory yields the ability to analyze layered control architectures via a compositional approach.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the proposals aiming at enabling Vertical, two-sided markets with a Single Marketplace (or exchange) (VSMs) for computing and data resources/services (products) offerings in a multi-cloud and crowdsourced IoT-edge sensing environment. A VSM is designed vertically from bottom up with a broker being a built-in component of the marketplace. While preventing seller lock-in and improving efficiency and availability, a VSM suffers from a key weakness from a buyer's perspective, i.e., the broker and the corresponding marketplace lock-in, which may lead to suboptimal shopping experience for buyers, due to marketplace monopoly by the broker and limited choice of products in the marketplace. In this position paper, we argue that a Horizontal two-sided market with Multiple Marketplaces (HMM), resembling the global stock market, should be developed. In an HMM, different marketplaces may be operated by different parties and sell similar and/or different types of products, e.g., computing and/or sensory data products. A broker is no longer a built-in component of any given marketplace. Instead, it may cover multiple marketplaces at the same time and there can be more than one broker in the HMM. Both the number and types of marketplaces and brokers may grow independently or scale horizontally to meet the growing demand. A buyer shops for a broker through whom the buyer gains access to the needed products sold in the marketplace(s) the broker covers and from whom the buyer receives various possible services, e.g., discount, value-added, or full services. An HMM not only overcomes the key weakness of a VSM but also allows the market to grow incrementally and organically. Finally, two example use cases are given to illustrate the benefits of HMM.</description>

      <title>Cloud Deployment of Large-Scale Electromagnetic Transient Simulation -- Discovery and Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation starts to play a critical role in modern power system planning and operations due to large penetration of inverter based resources (IBRs). The EMT studies are computationally intensive due to very small simulation time step and complex modeling of the protection and control of IBRs. It has been challenging for the traditional on-premises computing infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing computing needs of large-scale EMT studies. This paper shares experience of ISO New England (ISO-NE) on a pilot deployment of EMT simulation in a public cloud using Amazon Web Services. The platform can successfully meet the large-scale EMT simulation computation needs in a cost-effective way while meeting cyber security and data privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>A 3.5 GS/s 1-1 MASH VCO ADC With Second-Order Noise Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a 3.5 GS/s voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) is presented. This 28nm CMOS ADC achieves second-order noise shaping in an easily-scalable, open-loop configuration. A key enabler of the high-bandwidth MASH VCO ADC is the use of a multi-bit estimated error signal. With an OSR of 16, an SNDR of 67 dB and DR of 68 dB are achieved in 109.375 MHz bandwidth. The full-custom pseudo-analog circuits consume 9 mW, while the automatically generated digital circuits consume another 24 mW. A $\mathbf{FoM_{DR} = 163}$ dB and core area of $\mathbf{0.017\,\mathbf{mm}^2}$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</description>

      <title>Key-Scan-Based Mobile Robot Navigation: Integrated Mapping, Planning, and Control using Graphs of Scan Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe autonomous navigation in a priori unknown environments is an essential skill for mobile robots to reliably and adaptively perform diverse tasks (e.g., delivery, inspection, and interaction) in unstructured cluttered environments. Hybrid metric-topological maps, constructed as a pose graph of local submaps, offer a computationally efficient world representation for adaptive mapping, planning, and control at the regional level. In this paper, we consider a pose graph of locally sensed star-convex scan regions as a metric-topological map, with star convexity enabling simple yet effective local navigation strategies. We design a new family of safe local scan navigation policies and present a perception-driven feedback motion planning method through the sequential composition of local scan navigation policies, enabling provably correct and safe robot navigation over the union of local scan regions. We introduce a new concept of bridging and frontier scans for automated key scan selection and exploration for integrated mapping and navigation in unknown environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our key-scan-based navigation and mapping framework using a mobile robot equipped with a 360$^{\circ}$ laser range scanner in 2D cluttered environments through numerical ROS-Gazebo simulations and real hardware~experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Bounded Rationality in Strategic Data Gathering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimation from survey data gathered from strategic and boundedly-rational agents with heterogeneous objectives and available information. Particularly, we consider a setting where there are three different types of survey responders with varying levels of available information, strategicness, and cognitive hierarchy: i) a non-strategic agent with an honest response, ii) a strategic agent that believes everyone else is a non-strategic agent and that the decoder also believes the same, hence assumes a naive estimator, i.e., level-1 in cognitive hierarchy, iii) and strategic agent that believes the population is Poisson distributed over the previous types, and that the decoder believes the same. We model each of these scenarios as a strategic classification of a 2-dimensional source (possibly correlated source and bias components) with quadratic distortion measures and provide a design algorithm. Finally, we provide our numerical results and the code to obtain them for research purposes at https://github.com/strategic-quantization/bounded-rationality.</description>

      <title>Neural Configuration Distance Function for Continuum Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for modeling the shape of a continuum robot as a Neural Configuration Euclidean Distance Function (N-CEDF). By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CEDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robot's shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CEDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>MAGICS: Adversarial RL with Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg for Convergent Neural Synthesis of Robot Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.</description>

      <title>ProTEA: Programmable Transformer Encoder Acceleration on FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) have been widely utilized on a diverse range of applications, including natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV). Their widespread adoption has been primarily driven by the exceptional performance of their multi-head self-attention block used to extract key features from sequential data. The multi-head self-attention block is followed by feedforward neural networks, which play a crucial role in introducing non-linearity to assist the model in learning complex patterns. Despite the popularity of TNNs, there has been limited numbers of hardware accelerators targeting these two critical blocks. Most prior works have concentrated on sparse architectures that are not flexible for popular TNN variants. This paper introduces \textit{ProTEA}, a runtime programmable accelerator tailored for the dense computations of most of state-of-the-art transformer encoders. \textit{ProTEA} is designed to reduce latency by maximizing parallelism. We introduce an efficient tiling of large matrices that can distribute memory and computing resources across different hardware components within the FPGA. We provide run time evaluations of \textit{ProTEA} on a Xilinx Alveo U55C high-performance data center accelerator card. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{ProTEA} can host a wide range of popular transformer networks and achieve near optimal performance with a tile size of 64 in the multi-head self-attention block and 6 in the feedforward networks block when configured with 8 parallel attention heads, 12 layers, and an embedding dimension of 768 on the U55C. Comparative results are provided showing \textit{ProTEA} is 2.5$\times$ faster than an NVIDIA Titan XP GPU. Results also show that it achieves 1.3 -- 2.8$\times$ speed up compared with current state-of-the-art custom designed FPGA accelerators.</description>

      <title>Will Large Language Models be a Panacea to Autonomous Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</description>

      <title>A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators (charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss improvement of at least 57.23%.</description>

      <title>Cluster-based Network Time Synchronization for Resilience with Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time synchronization of devices in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is one of the challenging problems and a pre-requisite for the design of low-latency applications. Although many existing solutions have tried to address this problem, almost all solutions assume all the devices (nodes) in the network are faultless. Furthermore, these solutions exchange a large number of messages to achieve synchronization, leading to significant communication and energy overhead. To address these shortcomings, we propose C-sync, a clustering-based decentralized time synchronization protocol that provides resilience against several types of faults with energy-efficient communication. C-sync achieves scalability by introducing multiple reference nodes in the network that restrict the maximum number of hops any node can have to its time source. The protocol is designed with a modular structure on the Contiki platform to allow application transitions. We evaluate C-sync on a real testbed that comprises over 40 Tmote Sky hardware nodes distributed across different levels in a building and show through experiments the fault resilience, energy efficiency, and scalability of the protocol. C-sync detects and isolates faults to a cluster and recovers quickly. The evaluation makes a qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art protocols and a quantitative comparison with a class of decentralized protocols (derived from GTSP) that provide synchronization with no/limited fault-tolerance. Results also show a reduction of 56.12% and 75.75% in power consumption in the worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively, compared to GTSP, while achieving similar accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adapting Gait Frequency for Posture-regulating Humanoid Push-recovery via Hierarchical Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current humanoid push-recovery strategies often use whole-body motion, yet posture regulation is often overlooked. For instance, during manipulation tasks, the upper body may need to stay upright and have minimal recovery displacement. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing humanoid push-recovery performance under unknown disturbances and regulating body posture by tailoring the recovery stepping strategy. We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach, We also demonstrate improved push-recovery performance and minimized attitude change under 0.2 rad.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Communications for Interplanetary and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated pace of space exploration and satellite connectivity calls for scalable communication network architectures that can effectively cater for increasing numbers of bursty flows, such as those occurring in remote monitoring and actuation. Communications in Space face unique challenges including highly variable delays and disruptions that sometimes preclude real-time signaling and end-to-end acknowledgements. In this paper we provide a vision for tackling these fundamental challenges by exploiting recent progress in goal-oriented communication. Our vision for Goal-Oriented Networking in Space is built on three pillars: (1) principles and decision metrics for goal-oriented sampling and multi-user scheduling, that can handle highly variable delay processes that contain memory, (2) grant-free access policies for massive machine-type communications that replace exogenous arrivals with goal-oriented traffic shaping, and (3) flow control mechanisms that exploit the cross-layer operability at application and link layers of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols.</description>

      <title>Domain knowledge-guided machine learning framework for state of health estimation in Lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of battery state of health is crucial for effective electric vehicle battery management. Here, we propose five health indicators that can be extracted online from real-world electric vehicle operation and develop a machine learning-based method to estimate the battery state of health. The proposed indicators provide physical insights into the energy and power fade of the battery and enable accurate capacity estimation even with partially missing data. Moreover, they can be computed for portions of the charging profile and real-world driving discharging conditions, facilitating real-time battery degradation estimation. The indicators are computed using experimental data from five cells aged under electric vehicle conditions, and a linear regression model is used to estimate the state of health. The results show that models trained with power autocorrelation and energy-based features achieve capacity estimation with maximum absolute percentage error within 1.5% to 2.5% .</description>

      <title>Learning to Refine Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions via Uncertainty-Aware Online Parameter Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring safety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-Renyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of ICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing performance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both fixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios across safety and performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Impedance Control for Manipulators Handling Heavy Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attaching a heavy payload to the wrist force/moment (F/M) sensor of a manipulator can cause conventional impedance controllers to fail in establishing the desired impedance due to the presence of non-contact forces; namely, the inertial and gravitational forces of the payload. This paper presents an impedance control scheme designed to accurately shape the force-response of such a manipulator without requiring acceleration measurements. As a result, neither wrist accelerometers nor dynamic estimators for compensating inertial load forces are necessary. The proposed controller employs an inner-outer loop feedback structure, which not only addresses uncertainties in the robot's dynamics but also enables the specification of a general target impedance model, including nonlinear models. Stability and convergence of the controller are analytically proven, with results showing that the control input remains bounded as long as the desired inertia differs from the payload inertia. Experimental results confirm that the proposed impedance controller effectively shapes the impedance of a manipulator carrying a heavy load according to the desired impedance model.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Strong $r$-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In leader-follower consensus, strong $r$-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong $r$-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Control Revision Method for Autonomous Driving Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety is one of the most crucial challenges of autonomous driving vehicles, and one solution to guarantee safety is to employ an additional control revision module after the planning backbone. Control Barrier Function (CBF) has been widely used because of its strong mathematical foundation on safety. However, the incompatibility with heterogeneous perception data and incomplete consideration of traffic scene elements make existing systems hard to be applied in dynamic and complex real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce a generalized control revision method for autonomous driving safety, which adopts both vectorized perception and occupancy grid map as inputs and comprehensively models multiple types of traffic scene constraints based on a new proposed barrier function. Traffic elements are integrated into one unified framework, decoupled from specific scenario settings or rules. Experiments on CARLA, SUMO, and OnSite simulator prove that the proposed algorithm could realize safe control revision under complicated scenes, adapting to various planning backbones, road topologies, and risk types. Physical platform validation also verifies the real-world application feasibility.</description>

      <title>Enabling On-Chip High-Frequency Adaptive Linear Optimal Control via Linearized Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unpredictable and complex aerodynamic effects pose significant challenges to achieving precise flight control, such as the downwash effect from upper vehicles to lower ones. Conventional methods often struggle to accurately model these interactions, leading to controllers that require large safety margins between vehicles. Moreover, the controller on real drones usually requires high-frequency and has limited on-chip computation, making the adaptive control design more difficult to implement. To address these challenges, we incorporate Gaussian process (GP) to model the adaptive external aerodynamics with linear model predictive control. The GP is linearized to enable real-time high-frequency solutions. Moreover, to handle the error caused by linearization, we integrate end-to-end Bayesian optimization during sample collection stages to improve the control performance. Experimental results on both simulations and real quadrotors show that we can achieve real-time solvable computation speed with acceptable tracking errors.</description>

      <title>AmpAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Multi-stage Amplifier Schematic Design from Literature for Process and Performance Porting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-stage amplifiers are widely applied in analog circuits. However, their large number of components, complex transfer functions, and intricate pole-zero distributions necessitate extensive manpower for derivation and param sizing to ensure their stability. In order to achieve efficient derivation of the transfer function and simplify the difficulty of circuit design, we propose AmpAgent: a multi-agent system based on large language models (LLMs) for efficiently designing such complex amplifiers from literature with process and performance porting. AmpAgent is composed of three agents: Literature Analysis Agent, Mathematics Reasoning Agent and Device Sizing Agent. They are separately responsible for retrieving key information (e.g. formulas and transfer functions) from the literature, decompose the whole circuit's design problem by deriving the key formulas, and address the decomposed problem iteratively.
  AmpAgent was employed in the schematic design of seven types of multi-stage amplifiers with different compensation techniques. In terms of design efficiency, AmpAgent has reduced the number of iterations by 1.32$ \sim $4${\times}$ and execution time by 1.19$ \sim $2.99${\times}$ compared to conventional optimization algorithms, with a success rate increased by 1.03$ \sim $6.79${\times}$. In terms of circuit performance, it has improved by 1.63$ \sim $27.25${\times}$ compared to the original literature. The findings suggest that LLMs could play a crucial role in the field of complex analog circuit schematic design, as well as process and performance porting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce turnpike arguments in the context of optimal state estimation. In particular, we show that the optimal solution of the state estimation problem involving all available past data serves as turnpike for the solutions of truncated problems involving only a subset of the data. We consider two different mathematical characterizations of this phenomenon and provide corresponding sufficient conditions that rely on strict dissipativity and decaying sensitivity. As second contribution, we show how a specific turnpike property can be used to establish performance guarantees when approximating the optimal solution of the full problem by a sequence of truncated problems, and we show that the resulting performance (both averaged and non-averaged) is approximately optimal with error terms that can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of the horizon length. In addition, we discuss interesting implications of these results for the practically relevant case of moving horizon estimation and illustrate our results with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>SPformer: A Transformer Based DRL Decision Making Method for Connected Automated Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mixed autonomy traffic environment, every decision made by an autonomous-driving car may have a great impact on the transportation system. Because of the complex interaction between vehicles, it is challenging to make decisions that can ensure both high traffic efficiency and safety now and futher. Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve the quality of decision-making in this continuous, highly dynamic and interactive environment because of their stronger sensing and communicating ability. For multi-vehicle collaborative decision-making algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we need to represent the interactions between vehicles to obtain interactive features. The representation in this aspect directly affects the learning efficiency and the quality of the learned policy. To this end, we propose a CAV decision-making architecture based on transformer and reinforcement learning algorithms. A learnable policy token is used as the learning medium of the multi-vehicle joint policy, the states of all vehicles in the area of interest can be adaptively noticed in order to extract interactive features among agents. We also design an intuitive physical positional encodings, the redundant location information of which optimizes the performance of the network. Simulations show that our model can make good use of all the state information of vehicles in traffic scenario, so as to obtain high-quality driving decisions that meet efficiency and safety objectives. The comparison shows that our method significantly improves existing DRL-based multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Top Manifold Connectedness of Quantum Control Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of quantum systems has been proven to possess trap-free optimization landscapes under the satisfaction of proper assumptions. However, many details of the landscape geometry and their influence on search efficiency still need to be fully understood. This paper numerically explores the path-connectedness of globally optimal control solutions forming the top manifold of the landscape. We randomly sample a plurality of optimal controls in the top manifold to assess the existence of a continuous path at the top of the landscape that connects two arbitrary optimal solutions. It is shown that for different quantum control objectives including state-to-state transition probabilities, observable expectation values and unitary transformations, such a continuous path can be readily found, implying that these top manifolds are fundamentally path-connected. The significance of the latter conjecture lies in seeking locations in the top manifold where an ancillary objective can also be optimized while maintaining the full optimality of the original objective that defined the landscape.</description>

      <title>Peer-to-Peer Learning Dynamics of Wide Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit, non-asymptotic characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Learning and Optimal Policy Design in Multi-Agent MDPs Under Probabilistic Agent Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) that can undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the post-dropout system based on control and sampling of the pre-dropout system. The central planner's objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents' dropout probabilities. For MDPs with a certain transition independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show that under these assumptions, the value of the expected post-dropout system can be represented by a single MDP; this "robust MDP" eliminates the need to evaluate all $2^N$ realizations of the system, where N denotes the number of agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the pre-dropout system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system with good pre-dropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates for both the robust MDP and specific post-dropout system realizations and is justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent dropout can help a controller find good post-dropout policies before dropout occurs.</description>

      <title>Real-time Estimation of Bound Water Concentration during Lyophilization with Temperature-based State Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) has been shown to provide long-term stability for many crucial biotherapeutics, e.g., mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, allowing for higher storage temperature. The final stage of lyophilization, namely secondary drying, entails bound water removal via desorption, in which accurate prediction of bound water concentration is vital to ensuring the quality of the lyophilized product. This article proposes a novel technique for real-time estimation of the residual moisture during secondary drying in lyophilization. A state observer is employed, which combines temperature measurement and mechanistic understanding of heat transfer and desorption kinetics, without requiring any online concentration measurement. Results from both simulations and experimental data show that the observer can accurately estimate the concentration of bound water in real time for all possible concentration levels, operating conditions, and measurement noise. This framework can also be applied for monitoring and control of the residual moisture in other desorption-related processes.</description>

      <title>A trustworthy blockchain-based energy trading scheme for V2G operations in distributed power grids via integrated scheduling and trading framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology pose significant challenges for distributed power grids, particularly in fostering trust and ensuring effective coordination among stakeholders. In this paper, we developed an integrated scheduling and trading framework to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, we propose a cyber-physical blockchain architecture that enhances transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness. A case study, utilizing real-world data from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), demonstrates significant reductions in EV charging costs and the framework potential to support auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean exploration utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research focus. However, underwater tasks have mostly failed due to the observation delay caused by acoustic communication in the Internet of underwater things. In this study, we present an AoI optimized Markov decision process (AoI-MDP) to improve the performance of underwater tasks. Specifically, AoI-MDP models observation delay as signal delay through statistical signal processing, and includes this delay as a new component in the state space. Additionally, we introduce wait time in the action space, and integrate AoI with reward functions to achieve joint optimization of information freshness and decision-making for AUVs leveraging RL for training. Finally, we apply this approach to the multi-AUV data collection task scenario as an example. Simulation results highlight the feasibility of AoI-MDP, which effectively minimizes AoI while showcasing superior performance in the task. To accelerate relevant research in this field, we have made the simulation codes available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Ensuring System-Level Protection against Eavesdropping Adversaries in Distributed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the objective of protecting the states of a distributed dynamical system from eavesdropping adversaries. We prove that state-of-the-art distributed algorithms, which rely on communicating the agents' states, are vulnerable in that the final states can be perfectly estimated by any adversary including those with arbitrarily small eavesdropping success probability. While existing literature typically adds an extra layer of protection, such as encryption or differential privacy techniques, we demonstrate the emergence of a fundamental protection quotient in distributed systems when innovation signals are communicated instead of the agents' states.</description>

      <title>Context-Conditioned Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning for Reliable V2V Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving reliable multidimensional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) channel state information (CSI) prediction is both challenging and crucial for optimizing downstream tasks that depend on instantaneous CSI. This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Excitable Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (E-NOD) for Agile Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Excitable Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (E-NOD), which describe opinion-forming and decision-making behavior with superior "agility" in responding and adapting to fast and unpredictable changes in context, environment, or information about available options. E-NOD is derived by introducing a single extra term to the previously presented Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (NOD), which have been shown to enable fast and flexible multi-agent behavior. This extra term is inspired by the fast-positive, slow-negative mixed-feedback structure of excitable systems. The agile behaviors resulting from the excitable nature of decision-making driven by E-NOD are analyzed in a general setting and illustrated through an application to robot navigation around human movers.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry underlies stability in power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral homogeneity is often critical for the functioning of network systems of interacting entities. In power grids, whose stable operation requires generator frequencies to be synchronized--and thus homogeneous--across the network, previous work suggests that the stability of synchronous states can be improved by making the generators homogeneous. Here, we show that a substantial additional improvement is possible by instead making the generators suitably heterogeneous. We develop a general method for attributing this counterintuitive effect to converse symmetry breaking, a recently established phenomenon in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable symmetric state. These findings constitute the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking in real-world systems, and our method promises to enable identification of this phenomenon in other networks whose functions rely on behavioral homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game for Multi-robot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a Distributed Differentiable Dynamic Game (D3G) framework, which can efficiently solve the forward and inverse problems in multi-robot coordination. We formulate multi-robot coordination as a dynamic game, where the behavior of a robot is dictated by its own dynamics and objective that also depends on others' behavior. In the forward problem, D3G enables all robots collaboratively to seek the Nash equilibrium of the game in a distributed manner, by developing a distributed shooting-based Nash solver. In the inverse problem, where each robot aims to find (learn) its objective (and dynamics) parameters to mimic given coordination demonstrations, D3G proposes a differentiation solver based on Differential Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, which allows each robot to update its parameters in a distributed and coordinated manner. We test the D3G in simulation with two types of robots given different task configurations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of D3G for solving both forward and inverse problems in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <title>FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transport is a pivotal logistics mode for the long-distance and bulk transportation of goods. However, the intricate planning involved in this mode is often hindered by uncertainties, including weather conditions, cargo diversity, and port dynamics, leading to increased costs. Consequently, accurate estimation of the total (stay) time of the vessel and any delays at the port are essential for efficient planning and scheduling of port operations. This study aims to develop predictive analytics to address the shortcomings in the previous works of port operations for a vessels Stay Time and Delay Time, offering a valuable contribution to the field of maritime logistics. The proposed solution is designed to assist decision making in port environments and predict service delays. This is demonstrated through a case study on Brazil's ports. Additionally, feature analysis is used to understand the key factors impacting maritime logistics, enhancing the overall understanding of the complexities involved in port operations. Furthermore, we perform Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to interpret the effects of the features on the outcomes and understand their impact on each sample, providing deeper insights into the factors influencing port operations.</description>

      <title>Congestion Pricing for Efficiency and Equity: Theory and Applications to the San Francisco Bay Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Congestion pricing, while adopted by many cities to alleviate traffic congestion, raises concerns about widening socioeconomic disparities due to its disproportionate impact on low-income travelers. We address this concern by proposing a new class of congestion pricing schemes that not only minimize total travel time, but also incorporate an equity objective, reducing disparities in the relative change in travel costs across populations with different incomes, following the implementation of tolls. Our analysis builds on a congestion game model with heterogeneous traveler populations. We present four pricing schemes that account for practical considerations, such as the ability to charge differentiated tolls to various traveler populations and the option to toll all or only a subset of edges in the network. We evaluate our pricing schemes in the calibrated freeway network of the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate that the proposed congestion pricing schemes improve both the total travel time and the equity objective compared to the current pricing scheme.
  Our results further show that pricing schemes charging differentiated prices to traveler populations with varying value-of-time lead to a more equitable distribution of travel costs compared to those that charge a homogeneous price to all.</description>

      <title>Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dynamic Bipedal Jumping via Real-time Variable-model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic and continuous jumping remains an open yet challenging problem in bipedal robot control. Real-time planning with full body dynamics over the entire jumping trajectory presents unsolved challenges in computation burden. In this paper, we propose a novel variable-model optimization approach, a unified framework of variable-model trajectory optimization (TO) and variable-frequency Model Predictive Control (MPC), to effectively realize continuous and robust jumping planning and control on HECTOR bipedal robot in real-time. The proposed TO fuses variable-fidelity dynamics modeling of bipedal jumping motion in different jumping phases to balance trajectory accuracy and real-time computation efficiency. In addition, conventional fixed-frequency control approaches suffer from unsynchronized sampling frequencies, leading to mismatched modeling resolutions. We address this by aligning the MPC sampling frequency with the variable-model TO trajectory resolutions across different phases. In hardware experiments, we have demonstrated robust and dynamic jumps covering a distance of up to 40 cm (57% of robot height). To verify the repeatability of this experiment, we run 53 jumping experiments and achieve 90% success rate. In continuous jumps, we demonstrate continuous bipedal jumping with terrain height perturbations (up to 5 cm) and discontinuities (up to 20 cm gap).</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Outlier Accommodation for Tightly Coupled RTK-Aided Inertial Navigation Systems in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a fundamental approach for attaining continuously available absolute vehicle position and full state estimates at high bandwidth. For transportation applications, stated accuracy specifications must be achieved, unless the navigation system can detect when it is violated. In urban environments, GNSS measurements are susceptible to outliers, which motivates the important problem of accommodating outliers while either achieving a performance specification or communicating that it is not feasible. Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) is designed to optimally select measurements to address this problem. Existing RAPS approaches lack a method applicable to carrier phase measurements, which have the benefit of measurement errors at the centimeter level along with the challenge of being biased by integer ambiguities. This paper proposes a RAPS framework that combines Real-time Kinematic (RTK) in a tightly coupled INS for urban navigation applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this RAPS-INS-RTK framework, achieving 85.84% and 92.07% of horizontal and vertical errors less than 1.5 meters and 3 meters, respectively, using a smartphone-grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from a deep-urban dataset. This performance not only surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) requirements, but also shows a 10% improvement compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Efficient Reward Function Searchers for Custom-Environment Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving the effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose ERFSL, an efficient reward function searcher using LLMs, which enables LLMs to be effective white-box searchers and highlights their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each numerically explicit user requirement and employ a reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively adjust the weights without ambiguity and redundant adjustments by flexibly adopting directional mutation and crossover strategies, similar to genetic algorithms, based on the context provided by the training log analyzer. We applied the framework to an underwater data collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot learning). The reward critic successfully corrects the reward code with only one feedback instance for each requirement, effectively preventing unrectifiable errors. The initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without the need for weight search. Even in cases where a weight is 500 times off, on average, only 5.2 iterations are needed to meet user requirements. The ERFSL also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-4o mini, as we decompose the weight searching process to reduce the requirement for numerical and long-context understanding capabilities</description>

      <title>Agile Decision-Making and Safety-Critical Motion Planning for Emergency Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially for emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the distinct strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively attain efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple paths generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraints states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimal optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are expanding beyond clinical settings thanks to advances in hardware and algorithms. However, they still face challenges in user-friendliness and signal variability. Classification models need periodic adaptation for real-life use, making an optimal re-training strategy essential to maximize user acceptance and maintain high performance. We propose TOR, a train-on-request workflow that enables user-specific model adaptation to novel conditions, addressing signal variability over time. Using continual learning, TOR preserves knowledge across sessions and mitigates inter-session variability. With TOR, users can refine, on demand, the model through on-device learning (ODL) to enhance accuracy adapting to changing conditions. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a motor-movement dataset recorded with a non-stigmatizing wearable BMI headband, achieving up to 92% accuracy and a re-calibration time as low as 1.6 minutes, a 46% reduction compared to a naive transfer learning workflow. We additionally demonstrate that TOR is suitable for ODL in extreme edge settings by deploying the training procedure on a RISC-V ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9), resulting in 21.6 ms of latency and 1 mJ of energy consumption per training step. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an online, energy-efficient, dynamic adaptation of a BMI model to the intrinsic variability of EEG signals in real-time settings.</description>

      <title>GraspSAM: When Segment Anything Model Meets Grasp Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grasp detection requires flexibility to handle objects of various shapes without relying on prior knowledge of the object, while also offering intuitive, user-guided control. This paper introduces GraspSAM, an innovative extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), designed for prompt-driven and category-agnostic grasp detection. Unlike previous methods, which are often limited by small-scale training data, GraspSAM leverages the large-scale training and prompt-based segmentation capabilities of SAM to efficiently support both target-object and category-agnostic grasping. By utilizing adapters, learnable token embeddings, and a lightweight modified decoder, GraspSAM requires minimal fine-tuning to integrate object segmentation and grasp prediction into a unified framework. The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including Jacquard, Grasp-Anything, and Grasp-Anything++. Extensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility of GraspSAM in handling different types of prompts (such as points, boxes, and language), highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in real-world robotic applications.</description>
