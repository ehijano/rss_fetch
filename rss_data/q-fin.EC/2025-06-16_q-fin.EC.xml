      <title>Digital payment policy impact analysis on the intention to use QRIS (quick response code Indonesian standard) during COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the adoption of Bank Indonesia's QRIS (Quick Response code Indonesian Standard) payment system policy. The evaluation is hindered by the contemporaneous emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which acts as a confounding factor in adopting the new payment instrument. To disentangle the impact of central bank policy from the pandemic, a novel variation of the model of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is proposed and is estimated using purposive sampling from an online survey with 572 respondents during the pandemic. The result of the study successfully disentangles the policy effect from the pandemic effect, and also separate the risk of pandemic with common risks (PR) and other technology adoption determinants. The results indicate that perceived central bank policy and pandemic risk are the most influential variables affecting the intention to use QRIS. The findings suggest that this measurement approach can be appropriately used as a complementary tool to examine the effectiveness of the central bank's policy in influencing people's behavior.</description>

      <title>Parenthood Penalty in Russia: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study aimed to improve upon the existing correlational literature on the parenthood penalty in Russia. An instrumental variables approach based on sibling sex composition and multiple births was employed alongside difference-in-differences designs to analyze rich census and longitudinal datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide causal estimates of the effect of fertility decisions on subsequent labor market outcomes for mothers and fathers in contemporary Russia. The study's primary finding is that, in contrast to the approximately 10 percent long-term motherhood penalty observed in developed countries, the causal impact of childbearing on women's employment in Russia is most significant in the first year after birth, reducing employment by around 15 percent. This penalty then rapidly declines to a modest 3 percent once children reach school age. The analysis indicates an absence of a systematic fatherhood penalty in terms of employment, although a modest increase in labor supply is observed.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Assessment of Engineered Timber Reusability after Moisture Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered timber is pivotal to low-carbon construction, but moisture uptake during its service life can compromise structural reliability and impede reuse within a circular economy model. Despite growing interest, quantitative standards for classifying the reusability of moisture-exposed timber are still lacking. This study develops a probabilistic framework to determine the post-exposure reusability of engineered timber. Laminated specimens were soaked to full saturation, dried to 25% moisture content, and subjected to destructive three-point flexural testing. Structural integrity was quantified by a residual-performance metric that assigns 80% weight to the retained flexural modulus and 20% to the retained maximum load, benchmarked against unexposed controls. A hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic model with horseshoe priors, calibrated through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, jointly infers the decision threshold separating three Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) reuse levels and predicts those levels from five field-measurable features: density, moisture content, specimen size, grain orientation, and surface hardness. Results indicate that a single wet-dry cycle preserves 70% of specimens above the 0.90 residual-performance threshold (Level 1), whereas repeated cycling lowers the mean residual to 0.78 and reallocates many specimens to Levels 2-3. The proposed framework yields quantified decision boundaries and a streamlined on-site testing protocol, providing a foundation for robust quality assurance standards.</description>

      <title>A new approach to principal-agent problems with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent work by Cvitani\'c, Possama\"i, and Touzi (2018) [9] presents a general approach for continuous-time principal-agent problems, through dynamic programming and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the principal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of BSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9], namely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time, she can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this information is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming that the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best' fashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows the line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on continuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov (2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is identical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the contract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that this `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot directly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely on the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their optimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We believe that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time principal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the dissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even more intricate problems.</description>
