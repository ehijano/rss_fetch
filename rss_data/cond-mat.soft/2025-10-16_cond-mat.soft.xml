      <title>Random packing fraction of binary convex and similar hyperparticles with small size difference: Statistical geometry approaches to excluded volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the random packing fraction of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean space RD is studied using two statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4 resulting from integral geometry are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for (sphero-)cylinders (D = 3) and rectangles (D = 2), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. This allows the derivation of closed-form and generic expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.</description>

      <title>Time is length in self-similar logarithmic aging of physically cross-linked semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical aging in polymers is a fundamental yet poorly understood phenomenon, as diverse macromolecular systems exhibit remarkably similar slow dynamics. Through molecular dynamics simulations of physically crosslinked networks composed of semiflexible polymers, we identify a previously unexplored class of self-similar aging. The network undergoes ultra-slow coarsening characterized by a logarithmically growing mesh size, $L(t)\sim \ln t$, which governs the spatial organization, cohesive and bending energies, and the aging dynamics of the system. This single time-dependent length scale defines an internal clock, giving rise to spatio- temporal self-similarity of both structure and dynamics - offering a perspective on aging in soft and disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Demon's variational principle for informational active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between information, dissipation, and control is reshaping our understanding of thermodynamics in feedback-regulated systems. We develop the informational Onsager-Machlup principle, a generalized variational framework that unifies energetic, dissipative, and informational contributions within a single formalism. This framework introduces a conditioned Onsager-Machlup integral to quantify path entropy under specified memory states and enables the derivation of cumulant generating functions for arbitrary observables in systems with measurement and feedback. Applying this principle to a minimal model of an information-driven swimmer, where feedback adaptively modulates viscous drag based on velocity measurements, we obtain analytical expressions for the mean velocity and higher-order cumulants. Here, we show that information-based feedback can sustain persistent motion even in dissipative environments, establishing a theoretical foundation for informational active matter and providing a systematic route for designing feedback-powered engines operating far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Wettability from Diffusion: A Universal Molecular Scaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying wettability at the nanoscale remains challenging, as macroscopic contact-angle measurements fail to capture the molecular interactions that define hydrophilic and hydrophobic behavior. We derive an analytical relation linking the water contact angle to the lateral diffusion of interfacial molecules, establishing a quantitative connection between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic wettability. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the ratio of interfacial to bulk diffusion uniquely determines the contact angle across the full hydrophilic-hydrophobic spectrum. This diffusion-based formulation eliminates the need for droplet geometries or free-energy sampling, enabling quantitative assessment of wetting directly from short ab-initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The approach provides a universal and efficient route to evaluate surface affinity in reactive, defective, or confined environments.</description>

      <title>Physical models of embryonic epithelial healing: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <title>Spatial patterning of force centers controls folding pathways of active elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the spatial distribution of active force dipoles on the folding pathways and mechanical stability of rigid-elastic networks using Langevin dynamics simulations. While it has been shown in Majumdar et al., J. Chem. Phys. 163, 114902 (2025) that a sharp collapse transition is evident in triangular (elastic) bead-spring networks under the action of contractile (or extensile) force dipoles distributed randomly across the network, here, we show that when the spatial distribution is correlated, e.g., like a patch in the center (``active core'' model) or a band-like distribution along the periphery (``active periphery'' model), the network undergoes only a partial decrease in size even at large forces, thereby showing an enhanced mechanical stability just from a spatial rearrangement of the active dipoles. Further, an active periphery network shows higher mechanical stability initially, for a range of forces, beyond which the active core network becomes more stable. Deformation in the network becomes irreversible beyond a threshold force, which depends on the type of distribution; for a uniform distribution of active dipoles, the irreversibility threshold almost coincides with the critical collapse point, it decreases for the active core system, and is decreased further for the active periphery system. It is shown that irreversibility arises due to plastic deformations in the form of crease formation which is not reversible even after the force is turned off or reversed. The folding pathways depend weakly on the temporal stochasticity of the active links, but are highly sensitive to any defects (missing bonds) in the network. Our findings, therefore, suggest active force localization (or delocalization) as a prime method to dynamically alter the mechanical stability and reversibility of the underlying elastic network.</description>

      <title>Magnetomechanical Coupling in Ferronematic Phases: Influence of Spindle-Shaped Nanodopants on Liquid Crystalline Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferronematic phases, composed of liquid crystals doped with magnetic nanoparticles, exhibit unique magnetomechanical coupling effects that are of interest for responsive materials. In this study, we investigate the influence of spindle-shaped {\alpha}-Fe_2O_3 nanoparticles functionalized with a mesogen-decorated polymer brush on the phase behavior and field-induced transitions of a nematic host (5CB). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), refractometry, and dielectric spectroscopy reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the nematic-isotropic transition temperature on particle concentration, indicating a competition between stabilizing and destabilizing effects. The order parameter increases with increasing nanoparticle content, in contrast to non-magnetic reference systems, suggesting an alignment effect induced by the magnetic rather than the geometric anisotropy axis of the dopants. Capacitance measurements of the Freedericksz transition show a pronounced shift in threshold fields, with a critical concentration marking a transition to enhanced magnetic responsiveness. Additional information on nanospindle diffusion correlated to the direction-dependent flow of the nematic host was inferred from comparison of Moessbauer spectroscopy and rheology data. Our findings provide insights into the interplay of magnetic and geometric anisotropy in ferronematic systems and highlight their potential for applications in tunable soft matter devices.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic self-assembly of soft particles mediated by elliptically polarized AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attractive dipole interactions can be induced between equally charged soft nanoparticles under the influence of AC electric fields. The combination of charge repulsion and dipole attraction, along with different screening responses from an underlying electrolyte, lead to complex aggregations ranging from chain-like formation for linear polarizations to isotropic planar structures in the case of circular polarizations. In this work, we analyze the role of varying field anisotropies in these self-assembled structures. To this end, the formalism previously developed for the coarse-grained interactions of soft particles in the presence of linear [T.~Colla {\it et al.}, ACS Nano {\bf 12}, 4321-4337 (2018)] and circular [M.~Reich {\it et al.}, Soft Matter {\bf 21}, 1516-1528 (2025)] field polarizations is naturally extended to incorporate elliptical polarizations of arbitrary asymmetries. A rich variety of self-assembly formations is found at intermediate field anisotropies, thus bridging the gap between linear and circular field-induced self-assembly scenarios.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transitions Beyond the Nanoscale in Pressurized Silica Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth's interior. While pressure-induced changes in the short-range structure - particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry - have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to $P \approx 100$~GPa. Using a novel many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for $P \lesssim 10$~GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher $P$s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The $P$-dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Brownian particles (ABPs) serve as a minimal model of active matter systems. When ABPs are sufficiently persistent, they undergo a liquid-gas phase separation and, in the presence of obstacles, accumulate around them, forming a wetting layer. Here, we perform simulations of ABPs in a quasi-one-dimensional domain in the presence of a wall, studying the dynamics of the polarization field. On the course of time, we observe a transition from a homogeneous (where all particles are aligned) to a heterogeneous (where particles align only at the interface) polarization regime. We propose coarse-grained equations for the density and polarization fields based on microscopic and phenomenological arguments that correctly account for the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theory of Crystallization versus Vitrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between crystallization and vitrification in glass-forming materials manifests as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams, which quantify the time scales for crystallization as a function of temperature. We develop a coarse-grained lattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this competition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures, crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact crystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an analytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model. Both the model and theory can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy systems including bulk metallic glass alloys, organic molecules, and colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonreciprocity as a stabilizing effective potential in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions are known to produce distinctive dynamics in active matter. To shed light on how the stationary state of such systems is affected by breaking reciprocity, we consider active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles coupled nonreciprocally by a transverse force, which is perpendicular to the gradient of the interaction energy. Focusing on the steady-state distribution of positions, we show that the nonreciprocal coupling helps keep the system at its stable configurations, including not only energy minima but also nonequilibrium configurations stabilized by the persistent noise which propels the particles. In contrast, the transverse force would not change the stationary distribution at all if the noise were thermal. For a variety of active systems, we demonstrate the stabilizing role of the nonreciprocity, finding that it stiffens springs, aligns spins, improves associative memory, and enhances motility-induced phase separation.</description>
