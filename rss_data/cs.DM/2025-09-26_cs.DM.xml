      <title>An orderly algorithm for generation of Condorcet Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condorcet domains are fundamental objects in the theory of majority voting; they are sets of linear orders with the property that if every voter picks a linear order from this set, assuming that the number of voters is odd, and alternatives are ranked according to the pairwise majority ranking, then the result is a linear order on the set of all alternatives. In this paper we present an efficient orderly algorithm for the generation of all non-isomorphic maximal Condorcet domains on $n$ alternatives. The algorithm can be adapted to generate domains from various important subclasses of Condorcet domains. We use an example implementation to extend existing enumerations of domains from several such subclasses and make both data and the implementation publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Proof for the Edge-Density of 4-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most four times has at most $6(n-2)$ edges -- this result proven by Ackerman is outstanding in the literature of beyond-planar graphs with regard to its tightness and the structural complexity of the graph class. We provide a much shorter proof while at the same time relaxing the conditions on the graph and its embedding, i.e., allowing multi-edges and non-simple drawings.</description>

      <title>Maxout Polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any given time to solve many problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, that generalises both VIM width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both VIM and TIM width which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. In doing this, we provide a characterisation of problems in FPT with respect to both parameters. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, dominating set, matching, and edge deletion to limit maximum reachability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>

      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.</description>

      <title>Cluster deletion and clique partitioning in graphs with bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cluster Deletion problem takes a graph $G$ as input and asks for a minimum size set of edges $X$ such that $G-X$ is the disjoint union of complete graphs. An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks to find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the number of edges in the cliques is maximized.
  We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos that Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then investigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which are a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be NP-hard on permutation graphs.
  Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a $\frac{2\binom{c}{2}}{\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique Partition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More generally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which Maximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of examples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.</description>

      <title>Barvinok's interpolation method meets Weitz's correlation decay approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
  As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least $3$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.</description>
