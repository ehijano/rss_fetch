      <title>Tracking Brownian fluid particles in large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Simulating fluid-fluid displacement in a soft capillary tube: How compliance delays interfacial instability and bubble pinch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The displacement of a more viscous fluid by a less viscous immiscible fluid in confined geometries is a fundamental problem in multiphase flows. Recent experiments have shown that such fluid-fluid displacement in micro-capillary tubes can lead to interfacial instabilities and, eventually, bubble pinch-off. A critical yet often overlooked aspect of this system is the effect of the tube's deformability on the onset of interfacial instability and bubble pinch-off. Here, we present a computational fluid-structure interaction model and an algorithm to simulate this fluid-fluid displacement problem in a soft capillary tube. We use a phase-field model for the fluids and a nonlinear hyperelastic model for the solid. Our fluid-structure interaction formulation uses a boundary-fitted approach and we use isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization. Using this computational framework, we study the effects of inlet capillary number and tube stiffness on the control of interfacial instabilities in a soft capillary tube for both imbibition and drainage. We find that tube compliance delays or even suppresses interfacial instability and bubble pinch-off, a finding that has important implications for flow in soft porous media, bio-microfluidics, and manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Local volume-conserving lattice Boltzmann model for incompressible multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) equation, as a classical diffusion-interface method of phase-field, has been extensively employed for simulating two-phase fluid dynamics. However, it suffers from a key challenge in the simulation process, specifically the volume conservation of each phase cannot be guaranteed. To address this issue, in this paper, a modified C-H equation for two-phase flow modeling is first introduced, and the basic idea of this model lies in that it combines the profile correction method with the level-set approach, and thus, it effectively improves the deficiency of the classical C-H equation in terms of volume non-conservation of each phase. Based on this modified C-H equation, we further propose an accurate interface-capturing lattice Boltzmann (LB) model. After that, we perform a range of numerical simulations, including two stationary droplets immersed in the gas phase, single vortex, Rayleigh-Plateau fluid instability, and droplet deformation under a shear flow. These simulations illustrate that the proposed LB model has superior performance in maintaining local volume conservation and accurately capturing interfaces. More importantly, compared to the LB model derived from the classical C-H equation, it not only achieves more precise volume conservation for each phase but also provides a more consistent representation of the droplet's interface morphology more consistently, especially in dealing with small droplet problems.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Statistical Model for Fluid Thermodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems are computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatio-temporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction with an innovative recurrent architecture inspired by large language models, comprising a context builder and a sequence generator to capture temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Given the sensitivity of turbulent convection to initial conditions, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of viscoelastic properties of a liquid using an immersed rotating body of a general shape subjected to oscillatory shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for measuring linear and non-linear viscoelastic properties of a liquid by the oscillatory motion of an immersed rotating body in a vessel. The shape of a rotating object is general and we tested four different types of impellers: a disk, an anchor, and two different flat bladed turbines. In deriving the expressions of complex shear moduli, two different approaches were employed: one is based on the complex viscosity and the other is on the relationship between mean shear stress and mean shear strain. Both methods yield identical expressions for complex moduli. Using the latter method, the mean shear stress was appropriately scaled with torque, and the strain magnitude was scaled with the deflection angle, enabling its application to large-strain nonlinear oscillatory tests. Aqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions, xanthan gum solution and ketchup were tested and linear viscoelastic responses of storage and loss moduli were first presented as a function of the oscillation frequency. In spite of the presence of non-rheometric and highly non-uniform flow field, comparison with the data from the conventional cone-and-plate fixture of a rheometer shows remarkably accurate measurement with at most 7% average error within the frequency range from 0.01 [rad/s] to 100 [rad/s] for all the impeller geometries. In addition, large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments were also tested and discrepancy with highly elastic fluid were discussed. The proposed method may facilitate the in-situ measurement of viscoelastic properties of a fluid within an industrial reactor/agitator as a tool for on-line monitoring.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Three-Dimensional Electrohydrodynamic Interactions of Viscous Dielectric Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a drop of a leaky dielectric fluid is suspended in another fluid and subjected to a uniform DC electric field, it becomes polarized, leading to tangential electric stresses that drive fluid motion both inside and outside the drop. In the presence of a second drop, the dynamics of the first drop are altered due to electrohydrodynamic interactions with the second, causing the drops to translate due to dielectrophoretic forces and hydrodynamic interactions. We present a semi-analytical nonlinear three-dimensional small deformation theory for a pair of identical, widely-separated leaky dielectric drops suspended in a weakly conducting fluid. This theory is valid under conditions of large drop separation, high drop viscosity, and high surface tension, ensuring that the drops remain nearly spherical. For the first time, we develop a model within the Taylor--Melcher leaky dielectric framework that incorporates both transient charge relaxation and convection. This allows the model to capture the transition to Quincke rotation, a symmetry-breaking phenomenon in which drops begin to spontaneously rotate in sufficiently strong fields. We derive and numerically integrate coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the dipole moments, shapes, and positions of the drops. Our results show good quantitative agreement with previous numerical and experimental work in the limit of zero charge relaxation and convection. We also discuss the hysteresis in the onset of Quincke rotation of isolated drops observed in experiments. Various trajectories for pairs of drops undergoing Quincke rotation are presented, along with results for fixed drops. In particular, we show that the onset of Quincke rotation for a pair of drops is qualitatively different from that for an isolated drop due to electrohydrodynamic interactions and a pair of solid spheres due to straining flows present only in drops.</description>

      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>

      <title>Taylor dispersion of bubble swarms rising in quiescent liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dispersion of bubble swarms rising in initially quiescent water using 3D Lagrangian tracking of deformable bubbles and tracer particles in an octagonal bubble column. First, we compare the dispersion inside bubble swarms with that for single-bubble cases and find that the horizontal mean squared displacement (MSD) in the swarm cases exhibits oscillations around the asymptotic scaling predicted for a diffusive regime. This occurs due to wake-induced bubble motion, however, the oscillatory behaviour is heavily damped compared to the single-bubble cases due to the presence of bubble-induced turbulence (BIT) and bubble-bubble interactions in the swarm. The vertical MSD in bubble swarms is nearly an order of magnitude faster than the single-bubble cases, due to the much higher vertical fluctuating bubble velocities in the swarms. We also investigate tracer dispersion in BIT and find that concerning the time to transition away from the ballistic regime, larger bubbles with a higher gas void fraction transition earlier than tracers, consistent with Mathai et al. (\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 121, 054501, 2018). However, for bubble swarms with smaller bubbles and a lower gas void fraction, they transition at the same time. This differing behavior is due to the turbulence being more well-mixed for the larger bubble case, whereas for the smaller bubble case the tracer dispersion is highly dependent on the wake fluctuations generated by the oscillating motion of nearby bubbles.</description>

      <title>Observational causality by states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality plays a central role in understanding interactions between variables in complex systems. These systems often exhibit state-dependent causal relationships, where both the strength and direction of causality vary with the value of the interacting variables. In this work, we introduce a state-aware causal inference method that quantifies causality in terms of information gain about future states. The effectiveness of the proposed approach stems from two key features: its ability to characterize causal influence as a function of system state, and its capacity to distinguish between redundant and synergistic interactions. The method is validated across a range of benchmark cases in which the direction and strength of causality evolve in a prescribed manner with the state of the system. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in two real scenarios: the interaction between motions across scales in a turbulent boundary layer, and the Walker circulation phenomenon in tropical Pacific climate dynamics. Our results show that, without accounting for state-dependent causality as well as redundant and synergistic effects, traditional approaches to causal inference may lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lattice Kinetic Scheme for Solving Two-dimensional and Three-dimensional Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is particularly well-suited for implementation on quantum circuits owing to its simple algebraic operations and natural parallelism. However, most quantum LBMs fix $\tau$ = 1 to avoid nonlinear collision, which restricts the simulation to a fixed mesh size for a given Reynolds number. To preserve the simplicity of setting $\tau$ = 1 while enhancing flexibility, we propose a quantum lattice kinetic scheme (LKS) by introducing a constant parameter $A$ into the equilibrium distribution function (EDF), enabling independent adjustment of the fluid's viscosity. This modification removes the constraint on mesh size, making it possible to simulate flows with arbitrary Reynolds numbers. The Chapman-Enskog analysis confirms the modified EDF still recovers the Navier-Stokes equations without compromising collision accuracy. We evaluate the method on 2D and 3D Taylor-Green vortex and lid-driven cavity flows, demonstrating that quantum LKS attains the same accuracy and convergence order as classical LKS. The first application of quantum LBM to 3D incompressible flows represents a significant step forward in large-scale fluid dynamics simulation.</description>

Abstract: In a fractional Sobolev space $H^\frac{7}{4}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, we prove the desired low-regularity ill-posedness results for the 2D compressible Euler equations and the 2D ideal compressible MHD system. For the Euler equations, it is sharp with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity and density. The mechanism behind the obtained ill-posedness is the instantaneous shock formation.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of equations, showing that the transversely-averaged wave approximately satisfies a Boussinesq-type equation, while the lateral variation in the wave is related to certain integral functions of the bathymetry. Thus the homogenized equations not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Binned Spectral Power Loss for Improved Prediction of Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting multiscale chaotic dynamical systems with deep learning remains a formidable challenge due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which hinders the accurate representation of fine-scale structures in long-term predictions. This issue is exacerbated when models are deployed autoregressively, leading to compounding errors and instability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate the spectral bias which we call the Binned Spectral Power (BSP) Loss. The BSP loss is a frequency-domain loss function that adaptively weighs errors in predicting both larger and smaller scales of the dataset. Unlike traditional losses that focus on pointwise misfits, our BSP loss explicitly penalizes deviations in the energy distribution across different scales, promoting stable and physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that the BSP loss mitigates the well-known problem of spectral bias in deep learning. We further validate our approach for the data-driven high-dimensional time-series forecasting of a range of benchmark chaotic systems which are typically intractable due to spectral bias. Our results demonstrate that the BSP loss significantly improves the stability and spectral accuracy of neural forecasting models without requiring architectural modifications. By directly targeting spectral consistency, our approach paves the way for more robust deep learning models for long-term forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems.</description>
