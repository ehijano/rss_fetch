      <title>Impact of launch power optimisation in hybrid-amplified links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Per-channel launch power optimisation in a hybrid-amplified link with optimised pump powers and wavelengths is described. Compared to using the optimum spectrally uniform launch power, an average SNR gain of 0.13 dB is obtained against 0.56 dB for the same system operating with lumped amplifiers only.</description>

      <title>Soft Multipath Information-Based UWB Tracking in Cluttered Scenarios: Preliminaries and Validations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate ultra-wideband (UWB) localization and tracking in cluttered environments. Instead of mitigating the multipath, we exploit the specular reflections to enhance the localizability and improve the positioning accuracy. With the assistance of the multipath, it is also possible to achieve localization purposes using fewer anchors or when the line-of-sight propagations are blocked. Rather than using single-value distance, angle, or Doppler estimates for the localization, we model the likelihoods of both the line-of-sight and specular multipath components, namely soft multipath information, and propose the multipath-assisted probabilistic UWB tracking algorithm. Experimental results in a cluttered industrial scenario show that the proposed algorithm achieves 46.4 cm and 33.1 cm 90th percentile errors in the cases of 3 and 4 anchors, respectively, which outperforms conventional methods with more than 61.8% improvement given fewer anchors and strong multipath effect.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Networks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) in federated learning. We implemented Wav-KAN \cite{wav-kan} in the clients. Indeed, we have considered both continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and also discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to enable multiresolution capabaility which helps in heteregeneous data distribution across clients. Extensive experiments were conducted on different datasets, demonstrating Wav-KAN's superior performance in terms of interpretability, computational speed, training and test accuracy. Our federated learning algorithm integrates wavelet-based activation functions, parameterized by weight, scale, and translation, to enhance local and global model performance. Results show significant improvements in computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of wavelet selection in scalable neural network design.</description>

      <title>A real/fast-time simulator for impact assessment of spoofing &amp; jamming attacks on GNSS receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In aviation, the impact of threats is becoming increasingly significant, particularly for global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Two relevant GNSS threats are represented by jamming and spoofing. In order to evaluate the technological solutions to counter GNSS attacks, such attacks should be assessed by means of a proper GNSS threat simulator. This work shows the implementation and the testing results of a GNSS security impact simulator which injects the desired threat scenarios as a deviations on the GNSS actual measurements. The proposed simulator can be integrated in both real- and fast-time simulation environments. The provided results confirm the effectiveness of the simulator, and include in-flight demonstrations by means of a flight experimental vehicle.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Sensing at THz Frequencies via a Two-Stage Ultra-Wideband MIMO-OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only the chairs can edit The availability of abundant bandwidth at terahertz (THz) frequencies holds promise for significantly enhancing the sensing performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the next-generation wireless systems, enabling high accuracy and resolution for precise target localization. In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, wide bandwidth can be achieved by increasing the subcarrier spacing rather than the number of subcarriers, thereby keeping the complexity of the sensing system low. However, this approach may lead to an ambiguity problem in target range estimation. To address this issue, this work proposes a two-stage maximum likelihood method for estimating target position in an ultra-wideband bistatic multiple-antenna OFDM-based ISAC system operating at THz frequencies. Numerical results show that the proposed estimation approach effectively resolves the ambiguity problem while achieving high resolution and accuracy target position estimation at a very low signal-to-noise ratio regime.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Analysis of Neuromorphic Coding for Distributed Wireless Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Spiking neural networks (WSNNs) allow energy-efficient device-to-device (D2D) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, especially while considering edge intelligence and learning for beyond 5G and 6G systems. Recent research work has revealed that distributed wireless SNNs (DWSNNs) show good performance in terms of inference accuracy and low energy consumption of edge devices, under the constraints of limited bandwidth and spike loss probability. In this work, we focus on neuromorphic, AI-native transmission techniques for DWSNNs, quantitatively evaluating the features of different coding algorithms that can be viewed as impulse radio modulations. Specifically, the main contribution of this work is the evaluation of information-theoretic measures that may help in quantifying performance trade-offs among existing neuromorphic coding techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Satellite Telecommunications Testbed (AISTT), part of the ESA project SPAICE, is focused on the transformation of the satellite payload by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies over available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AI chips for on-board processing. The objectives include validating artificial intelligence-driven SATCOM scenarios such as interference detection, spectrum sharing, radio resource management, decoding, and beamforming. The study highlights hardware selection and payload architecture. Preliminary results show that ML models significantly improve signal quality, spectral efficiency, and throughput compared to conventional payload. Moreover, the testbed aims to evaluate the performance and application of AI-capable COTS chips in onboard SATCOM contexts.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Picosecond Synchronization for Distributed Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a wireless, decentralized time-alignment method for distributed antenna arrays and distributed wireless networks that achieves picosecond-level synchronization. Distributed antenna arrays consist of spatially separated antennas that coordinate their functionality at the wavelength level to achieve coherent operations such as distributed beamforming. Accurate time alignment (synchronization) of the local clocks on each node in the array is necessary to support accurate time-delay beamforming of modulated signals. In this work we combine a consensus averaging algorithm and a high-accuracy wireless two-way time transfer method to achieve decentralized time alignment, correcting for the time-varying bias of the clocks in a method that has no central node. Internode time transfer is based on a spectrally-sparse, two-tone signal achieving near-optimal time delay accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate the approach in a wireless four-node software-defined radio system, with various network connectivity graphs. We show that within 20 iterations all the nodes achieve convergence within a bias of less than 12 ps and a standard deviation of less than 3 ps. The performance is evaluated versus the bandwidth of the two-tone waveform, which impacts the synchronization error, and versus the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Based Time-Series Risk Scoring for Anomaly Detection and Alert Filtering -- A Predictive Maintenance Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault detection is a key challenge in the management of complex systems. In the context of SparkCognition's efforts towards predictive maintenance in large scale industrial systems, this problem is often framed in terms of anomaly detection - identifying patterns of behavior in the data which deviate from normal. Patterns of normal behavior aren't captured simply in the coarse statistics of measured signals. Rather, the multivariate sequential pattern itself can be indicative of normal vs. abnormal behavior. For this reason, normal behavior modeling that relies on snapshots of the data without taking into account temporal relationships as they evolve would be lacking. However, common strategies for dealing with temporal dependence, such as Recurrent Neural Networks or attention mechanisms are oftentimes computationally expensive and difficult to train. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient approach to anomaly detection and alert filtering based on sequential pattern similarities. In our empirical analysis section, we show how this approach can be leveraged for a variety of purposes involving anomaly detection on a large scale real-world industrial system. Subsequently, we test our approach on a publicly-available dataset in order to establish its general applicability and robustness compared to a state-of-the-art baseline. We also demonstrate an efficient way of optimizing the framework based on an alert recall objective function.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Prognostics with Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches have recently been extensively explored for the prognostics of industrial assets. However, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability, which hinders their adoption in safety-critical applications. To improve their trustworthiness, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been applied in prognostics, primarily to quantify the importance of input variables for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) using post-hoc attribution methods. In this work, we propose the application of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a family of inherently interpretable neural network architectures based on concept explanations, to the task of RUL prediction. Unlike attribution methods, which explain decisions in terms of low-level input features, concepts represent high-level information that is easily understandable by users. Moreover, once verified in actual applications, CBMs enable domain experts to intervene on the concept activations at test-time. We propose using the different degradation modes of an asset as intermediate concepts. Our case studies on the New Commercial Modular AeroPropulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) aircraft engine dataset for RUL prediction demonstrate that the performance of CBMs can be on par or superior to black-box models, while being more interpretable, even when the available labeled concepts are limited.

      <title>Listenable Maps for Zero-Shot Audio Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the Zero-Shot context), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc interpretation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that maximizes the faithfulness to the original similarity between a given text-and-audio pair. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts.</description>

      <title>Design of a Rectangular Linear Microstrip Patch Antenna Array for 5G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and characterization of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna array optimized for operation within the Ku-band frequency range. The antenna array is impedance-matched to 50 Ohms and utilizes a microstrip line feeding mechanism for excitation. The design maintains compact dimensions, with the overall antenna occupying an area of 29.5x7 mm. The antenna structure is modelled on an R03003 substrate material, featuring a dielectric constant of 3, a low-loss tangent of 0.0009, and a thickness of 1.574 mm. The substrate is backed by a conducting ground plane, and the array consists of six radiating patch elements positioned on top. Evaluation of the designed antenna array reveals a resonant frequency of 18GHz, with a -10 dB impedance bandwidth extending over 700MHz. The antenna demonstrates a high gain of 7.51dBi, making it well-suited for applications in 5G and future communication systems. Its compact form factor, cost-effectiveness, and broad impedance and radiation coverage further underscore its potential in these domains.</description>

      <title>SleepFM: Multi-modal Representation Learning for Sleep Across Brain Activity, ECG and Respiratory Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is a complex physiological process evaluated through various modalities recording electrical brain, cardiac, and respiratory activities. We curate a large polysomnography dataset from over 14,000 participants comprising over 100,000 hours of multi-modal sleep recordings. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed SleepFM, the first multi-modal foundation model for sleep analysis. We show that a novel leave-one-out approach for contrastive learning significantly improves downstream task performance compared to representations from standard pairwise contrastive learning. A logistic regression model trained on SleepFM's learned embeddings outperforms an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on sleep stage classification (macro AUROC 0.88 vs 0.72 and macro AUPRC 0.72 vs 0.48) and sleep disordered breathing detection (AUROC 0.85 vs 0.69 and AUPRC 0.77 vs 0.61). Notably, the learned embeddings achieve 48% top-1 average accuracy in retrieving the corresponding recording clips of other modalities from 90,000 candidates. This work demonstrates the value of holistic multi-modal sleep modeling to fully capture the richness of sleep recordings. SleepFM is open source and available at https://github.com/rthapa84/sleepfm-codebase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently utilize the scarce wireless resource, the random access scheme has been attaining renewed interest primarily in supporting the sporadic traffic of a large number of devices encountered in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we investigate the performance of slotted ALOHA -- a simple and practical random access scheme -- in connection with the grant-free random access protocol applied for user-centric cell-free massive MIMO. More specifically, we provide the expression of the sum-throughput under the assumptions of the capture capability owned by the centralized detector in the uplink. Further, a comparative study of user-centric cell-free massive MIMO with other types of networks is provided, which allows us to identify its potential and possible limitation. Our numerical simulations show that the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO has a good trade-off between performance and fronthaul load, especially at low activation probability regime.</description>

      <title>Joint Radar Sensing, Location, and Communication Resources Optimization in 6G Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of jointly optimizing location sensing and communication resources, facilitated by the existence of communication and sensing spectrum sharing, is what promotes the system performance to a higher level. However, the rapid mobility of user equipment (UE) can result in inaccurate location estimation, which can severely degrade system performance. Therefore, the precise UE location sensing and resource allocation issues are investigated in a spectrum sharing sixth generation network. An approach is proposed for joint subcarrier and power optimization based on UE location sensing, aiming to minimize system energy consumption. The joint allocation process is separated into two key phases of operation. In the radar location sensing phase, the multipath interference and Doppler effects are considered simultaneously, and the issues of UE's location and channel state estimation are transformed into a convex optimization problem, which is then solved through gradient descent. In the communication phase, a subcarrier allocation method based on subcarrier weights is proposed. To further minimize system energy consumption, a joint subcarrier and power allocation method is introduced, resolved via the Lagrange multiplier method for the non-convex resource allocation problem. Simulation analysis results indicate that the location sensing algorithm exhibits a prominent improvement in accuracy compared to benchmark algorithms. Simultaneously, the proposed resource allocation scheme also demonstrates a substantial enhancement in performance relative to baseline schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of ranging threats represented by Ghost Peak attack have raised concerns regarding the security performance of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems with the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4z standard. Based on channel reciprocity, this paper proposes a low complexity attack detection scheme that compares Channel Impulse Response (CIR) features of both ranging sides utilizing an autoencoder with the capability of data compression and feature extraction. Taking Ghost Peak attack as an example, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness, feasibility and generalizability of the proposed attack detection scheme through simulation and experimental validation. The proposed scheme achieves an attack detection success rate of over 99% and can be implemented in current systems at low cost.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinear spiked random matrix model where a nonlinear function is applied element-wise to a noise matrix perturbed by a rank-one signal. We establish a signal-plus-noise decomposition for this model and identify precise phase transitions in the structure of the signal components at critical thresholds of signal strength. To demonstrate the applicability of this decomposition, we then utilize it to study new phenomena in the problems of signed signal recovery in nonlinear models and community detection in transformed stochastic block models. Finally, we validate our results through a series of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Multi-Device Task-Oriented Communication via Maximal Coding Rate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In task-oriented communications, most existing work designed the physical-layer communication modules and learning based codecs with distinct objectives: learning is targeted at accurate execution of specific tasks, while communication aims at optimizing conventional communication metrics, such as throughput maximization, delay minimization, or bit error rate minimization. The inconsistency between the design objectives may hinder the exploitation of the full benefits of task-oriented communications. In this paper, we consider a task-oriented multi-device edge inference system over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access channel, where the learning (i.e., feature encoding and classification) and communication (i.e., precoding) modules are designed with the same goal of inference accuracy maximization. Instead of end-to-end learning which involves both the task dataset and wireless channel during training, we advocate a separate design of learning and communication to achieve the consistent goal. Specifically, we leverage the maximal coding rate reduction (MCR2) objective as a surrogate to represent the inference accuracy, which allows us to explicitly formulate the precoding optimization problem. We cast valuable insights into this formulation and develop a block coordinate ascent (BCA) algorithm for efficient problem-solving. Moreover, the MCR2 objective serves the loss function for feature encoding and guides the classification design. Simulation results on the synthetic features explain the mechanism of MCR2 precoding at different SNRs. We also validate on the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets that the proposed design achieves a better latency-accuracy tradeoff compared to various baselines. As such, our work paves the way for further exploration into the synergistic alignment of learning and communication objectives in task-oriented communication systems.</description>

      <title>Exploit High-Dimensional RIS Information to Localization: What Is the Impact of Faulty Element?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel localization algorithm using the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) received signal, i.e., RIS information. Compared with BS received signal, i.e., BS information, RIS information offers higher dimension and richer feature set, thereby providing an enhanced capacity to distinguish positions of the mobile users (MUs). Additionally, we address a practical scenario where RIS contains some unknown (number and places) faulty elements that cannot receive signals. Initially, we employ transfer learning to design a two-phase transfer learning (TPTL) algorithm, designed for accurate detection of faulty elements. Then our objective is to regain the information lost from the faulty elements and reconstruct the complete high-dimensional RIS information for localization. To this end, we propose a transfer-enhanced dual-stage (TEDS) algorithm. In \emph{Stage I}, we integrate the CNN and variational autoencoder (VAE) to obtain the RIS information, which in \emph{Stage II}, is input to the transferred DenseNet 121 to estimate the location of the MU. To gain more insight, we propose an alternative algorithm named transfer-enhanced direct fingerprint (TEDF) algorithm which only requires the BS information. The comparison between TEDS and TEDF reveals the effectiveness of faulty element detection and the benefits of utilizing the high-dimensional RIS information for localization. Besides, our empirical results demonstrate that the performance of the localization algorithm is dominated by the high-dimensional RIS information and is robust to unoptimized phase shifts and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Digital-Analog Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital and analog semantic communications (SemCom) face inherent limitations such as data security concerns in analog SemCom, as well as leveling-off and cliff-edge effects in digital SemCom. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemCom framework and a corresponding system called HDA-DeepSC, which leverages a hybrid digital-analog approach for multimedia transmission. This is achieved through the introduction of digital-analog allocation and fusion modules. To strike a balance between data rate and distortion, we design new loss functions that take into account long-distance dependencies in the semantic distortion constraint, essential information recovery in the channel distortion constraint, and optimal bit stream generation in the rate constraint. Additionally, we propose denoising diffusion-based signal detection techniques, which involve carefully designed variance schedules and sampling algorithms to refine transmitted signals. Through extensive numerical experiments, we will demonstrate that HDA-DeepSC exhibits robustness to channel variations and is capable of supporting various communication scenarios. Our proposed framework outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and multi-scale structural similarity, showcasing its superiority in semantic communication quality.</description>

      <title>The last Dance : Robust backdoor attack via diffusion models and bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05967v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R2D2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Decentralized Stochastic Successive Convex Approximation for composite non-convex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the decentralized successive convex approximation (SCA) method for minimizing stochastic non-convex objectives subject to convex constraints, along with possibly non-smooth convex regularizers. Although SCA has been widely applied in decentralized settings, its stochastic first order (SFO) complexity is unknown, and it is thought to be slower than the centralized momentum-enhanced SCA variants. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art for SCA methods by proposing an accelerated variant, namely the \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{M}omentum-based \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{SCA} (\textbf{D-MSSCA}) and analyze its SFO complexity. The proposed algorithm entails creating a stochastic surrogate of the objective at every iteration, which is minimized at each node separately. Remarkably, the D-MSSCA achieves an SFO complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which is at par with the SFO complexity lower bound for unconstrained stochastic non-convex optimization in centralized setting.</description>

      <title>DCT-Based Decorrelated Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based attention initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To advance control, operation and planning tools of electrical networks with ML is not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed showing where and how ML algorithmis could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment. Then it develops an innovation roadmap that helps align our research community towards a goal-oriented realisation of the opportunities that AI upholds. This paper finds that the R\&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap may interest research centre managers in system operators, academics, and labs dedicated to advancing the next generation of tooling for electrical networks.</description>
