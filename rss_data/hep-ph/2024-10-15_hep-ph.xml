      <title>Holography and the internal structure of charmonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic models that consider classical vector fields in a 5-d background provide successful effective descriptions for heavy vector meson spectra. This holds both in the vacuum and in a thermal medium, like the quark gluon plasma. However, it is somehow mysterious the way that these phenomenological models work. In particular, what is the role of the fifth dimension and what is the relation between the holographic 5-d background and the physical (4-d) heavy mesons. Hadrons, in contrast to leptons, are composite particles with some internal structure, that depends on the energy at which they are observed. In this work, a static meson is represented by a heavy quark-antiquark pair with an interaction described by a Nambu Goto string living in the same 5-d background that provides field solutions leading to masses and decay constants of charmonium states. The interaction potential that shows up is linear for large distances with a string tension consistent with the effective Cornell potential. Introducing temperature $T$ in the background it is found, for the $J/\psi$ case, that there is a deconfining transition at some critical value of $T$. The results obtained indicate that the 5-d background is effectively representing the internal structure of the (static) charmonium (quasi) states.</description>

      <title>Susy breaking soft terms in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms for all the viable models in the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The calculations are performed in the general scenario of $u$-moduli dominance with the $s$-moduli turned on, where the soft terms remain independent of the Yukawa couplings and the Wilson lines. The results for the trilinear coupling, gaugino-masses, squared-mass parameters of squarks, sleptons and Higgs depend on the brane wrapping numbers and the susy breaking parameters. We find that unlike the Yukawa couplings which remain unchanged for the models dual under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors, the corresponding soft term parameters only match for the trilinear coupling and the mass of the gluino. This can be explained by the internal geometry where the Yukawa interactions depend only on the triangular areas of the worldsheet instantons while the soft terms have an additional dependence on the orientation-angles of D6-branes in the three two-tori. In the special limit of parameter space we find universal masses for the Higgs and the gauginos.</description>

      <title>Outlook for the Theoretical Precision of the Luminosity at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LEP precision physics requirements on the theoretical precision tag for the respective luminosity were $0.054 \%$ ($0.061\%$) at $M_Z$, where the former (latter) LEP result has (does not have) the pairs correction. For the contemplated FCC-ee, ILC, and CEPC Higgs/EW factories, one needs improvement at $M_Z$ to at least $0.01\%$ for the theoretical precision tag. We discuss the paths one may take to even exceed this latter goal and present an update on the current expectations for both $M_Z$ and proposed higher energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Collinearly Enhanced YFS MC Approach to Precision High Energy Collider Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the YFS IR resummation theory so that it includes all of the attendant collinear contributions which exponentiate. The attendant new resummed contributions are shown to agree with known results from the collinear factorization approach. We argue that they improve the corresponding precision tag for a given level of exactness in the respective YFS hard radiation residuals as the latter are realized in the YFS MC approach to precision high-energy collider physics.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of matching exponentiated photonic radiation to a QED-corrected parton shower in KKMChh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KKMChh is a precision Monte Carlo program for photonic and electroweak radiative corrections to hadron scattering, implementing the amplitude-level exponentiation originally developed for electron-positron scattering at the quark level, modeling initial and final state QED radiation as well as initial-final interference to all orders in a soft-photon approximation, adding hard photon corrections through second order next-to-leading logarithm. A previous ICHEP talk introduced a matching procedure NISR (negative initial-state radiation) to match the exponentiated photon radiation from the quarks to a QED-corrected parton shower. Here, we describe its effect on forward-backward asymmetry calculations of interest for a precise determination of the electroweak mixing angle.</description>

      <title>Rotation induced color confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent results based on the IR-improvement of unintegrable singularities in the infrared regime via amplitude-based resummation in $QED \times QCD \subset SU(2)_L \times U_1 \times SU(3)_c$. In the context of precision LHC$/$FCC physics, we focus on specific examples, such as the removal of QED contamination in PDFs evolved from data at ${Q_0}^2 \sim 2\; {\text{GeV}}^2$ and used in the evaluating precision observables in $pp \rightarrow Z + X \rightarrow \ell\bar{\ell} + X'$, in which we discuss new results and new issues.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the entanglement entropy for neutrino oscillations when neutrino propogate in matter, utilising Von Neumann entropy. We discuss two flavour neutrino oscillation in vaccum and matter. We demonstrate statistically that, depending on the length of oscillation for each energy, the entanglement entropy for the succeeding periods of the two-flavor neutrino oscillations in matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Isotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation Through Sidereal Effect at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) presents an intriguing opportunity to investigate fundamental symmetries, with neutrinos serving as a particularly effective probe for this phenomenon. Long-baseline neutrino experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), excel at exploring non-isotropic LIV, especially through the observation of sidereal effects. This study comprehensively examines the full parameter space of non-isotropic, non-diagonal LIV parameters with sidereal dependence, focusing on two distinct flux scenarios: a low-energy flux and a tau-optimized flux. Through this analysis, we derive more stringent constraints on LIV parameters. Our results indicate that DUNE may achieve enhanced sensitivity for some LIV parameters, exceeding all previously established limits and marking a significant advancement in the investigation of LIV.</description>

      <title>Indirect production of doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}$ at high energy colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect production mechanism of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ through three decay channels, Higgs$/Z^{0}\to \langle cc\rangle[n] \to T_{cc} +\bar{c}+\bar{c} $ and $W^+\to \langle cc\rangle[n] \to T_{cc} +\bar{c}+\bar{s} $, are analyzed at LHC and CEPC within the framework of NRQCD. The spin and color quantum number $[n]$ of the intermediate $\langle cc\rangle$ diquark state can be $[^1 S_0]_6$ and $[^3 S_1]_{\bar{3}}$. Then the intermediate $\langle cc\rangle$ diquark evolves into tetraquark components via the fragmentation process by trapping two light antiquarks from the vacuum. After all the doubly charmed tetraquark components are summed, including $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{u}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{d} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u}\bar{s}}$, and $T_{cc}^{\bar{d}\bar{s}}$, the total decay widths, branching ratios, and produced events per year for the production of $T_{cc}$ can be predicted at LHC and CEPC, respectively. The differential distributions and three main sources of theoretical uncertainty are also presented and discussed. The results show that the produced events per year for $T_{cc}$ via $W^{+}$ decays is $2.67\times10^5$, nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that by Higgs decays ($1.70\times10^{3}$) and $Z^{0}$ decays ($7.15\times10^3$) at LHC. However at CEPC, the largest contribution for the production of $T_{cc}$ is through $Z^{0}$ decays, about $2.42\times10^6$. There are only $7.33\times10^{-1}$ and $3.01\times10^{2}$ $T_{cc}$ events produced per year at CEPC through Higgs and $W^+$ decay, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing $B^0$-meson flavor changing neutral current decay into scalar $K_0^*(1430)$ meson with $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-(\nu\bar\nu)$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the rare decay $B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\ell^+\ell^-$ with $\ell=(e,\mu,\tau)$ and $B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\nu\bar{\nu}$ induced by the flavor changing neutral current transition of $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-(\nu\bar\nu)$. Firstly, the $B^0\to K_0^*(1430)$ transition form factors (TFFs) are calculated by using the QCD light-cone sum rule approach up to next-to-leading order accuracy. In which the $K_0^*(1430)$-meson twist-2 and twist-3 LCDAs have been calculated both from the SVZ sum rule in the background field theory framework and light-cone harmonic oscillator model. Then, we obtained the three TFFs at large recoil point, {\it i.e.,} $f_+^{B^0\to K_0^\ast}(0)= 0.470_{-0.101}^{+0.086}$, $f_-^{B^0\to K_0^\ast}(0)= -0.340_{-0.068}^{+0.068}$, and $f_{\rm T}^{B^0\to K_0^\ast}(0)= 0.537^{+0.112}_{-0.115}$. Meanwhile, we extrapolated TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$-region by using the simplified $z(q^2)$-series expansion. Furthermore, we calculate the $B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\ell^+\ell^-(\nu\bar{\nu})$ decay widths, branching fractions, and longitudinal lepton polarization asymmetries of $B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\ell^+\ell^-$, which lead to ${\cal B}(B^0\to K_0^*(1430)e^+e^-) = (6.65^{+2.52}_{-2.42})\times 10^{-7}$, ${\cal B}(B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\mu^+\mu^-)=(6.62^{+2.51}_{-2.41})\times 10^{-7}$, ${\cal B}(B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\tau^+\tau^-)=(1.88^{+1.10}_{-0.97})\times 10^{-8}$, ${\cal B}(B^0\to K_0^*(1430)\nu\bar{\nu})= 3.85^{+1.55}_{-1.48}\times 10^{-6}$ and the integrated longitudinal lepton polarization asymmetries $\langle A_{P_L} \rangle = (-0.99, -0.96, -0.03)$ for the cases $\ell=(e, \mu, \tau)$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking, chiral partners, and the $K_1$ and $K^*$ in medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the concept of chiral partners. For a vector meson, the isospin-zero and hypercharge-zero state in the flavor octet mixes with the flavor singlet state. Since the flavor singlet vector meson does not have a chiral partner, the mixed $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons will not have chiral partners. This means that even when chiral symmetry is restored, these mesons will not become degenerate with their corresponding parity partners. On the other hand, the $K_1$ and $K^*$ mesons are chiral partners, and both have widths smaller than 100 MeV. Therefore, we emphasize that studying these mesons in environments where chiral symmetry is restored is particularly important for understanding the effect of chiral symmetry restoration on chiral partners and their masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-messenger observations suggest that high-energy neutrinos may be produced close to central black holes in active galaxies. These regions may host dark-matter (DM) spikes, where the concentration of DM particles is very high. Here we explore the contribution of the DM annihilation to the target photons for the neutrino production, proton-photon interactions, estimate the associated neutrino spectrum and figure out possible future tests of this scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lectures we give an introduction and overview of the electroweak standard model (EWSM) of particle physics. We first introduce the basic concepts of quantum field theory necessary to build the EWSM: abelian and non-abelian gauge theories, spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism. We also introduce some basic concepts of renormalization, so as to be able to understand the full power of electroweak precision tests and their impact on our understanding the EWSM and its possible extensions. We discuss the current status of experimental tests and conclude by pointing the problems still existing in particle physics not solved by the EWSM and how these impact the future of the field.</description>

      <title>Strong decay widths of S- and P-wave singly-, doubly- and triply-heavy charm and bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of two-body decay widths of heavy baryons into another heavy baryon and a light pseudoscalar meson in the framework of the non-relativistic quark model in combination with the elementary emission model for the strong couplings. The present study includes the decays of 1S- and 1P-wave baryons with one, two or three heavy quarks, either charm (c) or bottom (b). The relative partial widths are given by the appropriate flavor SU(3) isoscalar factors. The flavor, spin and orbital contributions are discussed explicitly as well as selection rules for forbidden decays. The total widths are compared with the available experimental data as well as with other theoretical studies. The calculated widths of singly-heavy baryons are found to be in reasonable agreement with the observed widths. The decay widths of doubly-heavy baryons are suppressed with respect to those of the singly-heavy baryons by the ratios of the quark masses appearing in the orbital contributions.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic and nonleptonic decays of $B_{u,d,s,c}^{*}$ in the covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semileptonic and nonleptonic decays of the b-flavor vector mesons $B^{*}_{u,d,s}$ and $B_{c}^{*}$ are investigated within the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). By calculating the form factors of the transitions $B_{u, d, s, c}^{*}\to P$ under the CLFQM, with $P$ denoting a pseudoscalar meson, i.e., $\pi, K, \eta_c(1S,2S), D_{(s)}, B_{(s)}$, we predict and discuss several physical observables, including the branching ratios, polarization fractions $f_{L}, f_{\|}$, and forward-backward asymmetries $A_{FB}$. The total widths of the single-photon radiative decay channels for these b-flavor vector mesons are estimated using their partial widths.
  In these considered decays, one can find that the semileptonic decays $B_{s}^{*0}\to D_{s}^{-}\ell^{\prime+}{\nu}_{\ell^\prime}$ and $B_{c}^{*+}\to B_{s}^{0}\ell^{\prime+}{\nu}_{\ell^\prime}, \eta_{c}\ell^{\prime+}{\nu}_{\ell^\prime}$, with $\ell^\prime$ being $e$ or $\tau$, and the nonleptonic channels $B_{c}^{*+}\to B^0_{s} \pi^{+}, B^0_{s} \rho^{+}$ have the largest branching ratios, which can reach up to the $10^{-7}$ order, and are most likely to be accessible at the future high-luminosity LHCb and Belle-II experiments.</description>

      <title>Interplay between $M_W$, $\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$, and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ in Flavor Symmetry-Based Supersymmetric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) augmented by a non-abelian flavor symmetry labeled as sMSSM. Incorporating this flavor symmetry allows for a significant reduction in the original plethora of free parameters present in the MSSM, ultimately reducing them down to just seven in sMSSM. This reduction of free parameters is not achieved through ad hoc assumptions like in the constrained MSSM (CMSSM); rather, it is grounded in theoretical considerations. Our work focuses on exploring the interplay between the $W$ boson mass ($M_W$) predictions, the cold dark matter (CDM) relic abundance ($\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$), and the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly. We identified correlations among the theoretical parameters arising from this interplay, which can be complemented by experimental constraints such as the Higgs boson mass, B-physics observables, and charge and color breaking minima. Additionally, our investigations show that the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ discrepancy and the Planck bounds on $\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$ can be addressed within the sMSSM, but only in a very narrow region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>In-depth Study of Spin- and Momentum-Dependent Interaction Potentials Between Two Spin-1/2 Fermions Mediated by Light Spin-0 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation by including the relativistic and off-shell contributions to the interaction potentials between two spin-1/2 fermions mediated by the exchange of light spin-0 particles, in both momentum and coordinate spaces. Our calculation is based on the four-point Green function rather than the scattering amplitude. Among the sixteen potential components, eight that vanish in the non-relativistic limit are shown to acquire nonzero relativistic and off-shell corrections. In addition to providing relativistic and off-shell corrections to the operator basis commonly used in the literature, we introduce an alternative operator basis that facilitates the derivation of interaction potentials in coordinate space. Furthermore, we calculate both the long-range and short-range components of the potentials, which can be useful for future experimental analyses at both macroscopic and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Observability of 2HDM charged Higgs boson in a misaligned scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large hadron collider precision measurement of $h_{125}$ properties suggests that a misaligned two Higgs doublet model type 1 is preferred among other types of the model. In this analysis, a lepton collider potential for charged Higgs boson observation is evaluated and compared with HL-LHC expectations. We focus on $H^{\pm} \to W^{\pm}h_{125}$ decay which is exclusively activated in misalignment scenario. An event analysis including fast detector simulation is performed and it is shown that some parts of the parameter space which are out of HL-LHC reach can be probed by a high energy lepton collider with signal significance exceeding $2\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ for exclusion or discovery. The region with highest sensitivity is in the middle range charged Higgs boson mass, i.e., $350 &lt; m_{H^{\pm}} &lt;450$ GeV and $\tan \beta \gtrsim4$ at non-zero $\cos(\beta-\alpha)$ values.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule analysis of $0^{+}$ fourquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive QCD sum rules analysis for all types of light $J^P=0^{+}$ four-quark states at next-to-leading order. Most of them have masses around $1-2\text{GeV}$ and can be interpreted as the $0^+$ mesons observed in experiments. We find a category of four-quark nonets with masses $\lesssim1\text{GeV}$, potentially corresponding to the light $0^+$ mesons $f_0(500)$, $K^*_0(700)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$. Additionally, the 27-fold states may also exist, which are heavier than the $0^+$ nonets. The main uncertainty in the results arises from the factorization deviation of the multi-quark condensates. We also find that the factorization of dimension-8 condensates involves an ambiguity larger than $O(1/N_C^2)$. As a byproduct, a simple trick for renormalizing multi-quark operators at one-loop level is proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>All-loop renormalization group invariants for MSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For MSSM from the gauge couplings, Yukawa couplings, and the coefficient $\mu$ in the part of superpotential quadratic in the Higgs superfields we construct combinations which (for certain renormalization prescriptions) do not depend on the renormalization point in all loops. In other words, these combinations are the renormalization group invariants. Similar invariants are also constructed for NMSSM. The derivation is based on the nonrenormalization of the superpotential and the NSVZ equations. We argue that the scale invariance of the considered combinations takes place in the class of the HD+MSL schemes. This fact has been verified in the lowest orders, up to and including the one in which the dependence on the renormalization prescription becomes essential. It is also demonstrated that in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the renormalization group invariance does not take place starting from the approximation, where the scheme dependence manifests itself.</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks $P_c$ in a dynamical coupled-channel approach of $\gamma p \to J/\psi p$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a dynamical coupled-channel approach to photon-induced $J/\psi$ production to search for the trace of the pentaquarks $P_c$. In this approach, the considered open-charm intermediate states are $\Lambda_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$. Scattering amplitude involving $\Lambda_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$, $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $J/\psi p$ interactions is calculated from solving a set of coupled-channel integral equations. The coupled-channel interaction potentials are generated from one-boson-exchange. The pentaquarks $P_c$ are dynamically generated from the coupled-channel interactions. Moreover, the background contributions to the $P_c$ signals are assumed to be the Pomeron exchange and $\sigma$ exchange. The predicted total and differential cross sections of $J/\psi$ photoproduction are within the range of the data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-$007$ experiments. It is found that the $\sigma$ exchange plays a crucial role for determining the very near threshold cross section. The total cross section gets enhanced due to the open-charm state rescattering in the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ production regions, and is of order 1 nb.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and quadratic fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and temperature $T$ are investigated in a two-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. With nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in the cases with and without the IMC effect. The correlation and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlation ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{B(Q,T)}=\frac{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ},\ {\hat {\chi}}_2^{B}$, and ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{Q}$ increase with magnetic fields, and the inclusion of IMC effect leads to some enhancement in their values. However, ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{T}$ is altered by the IMC effect. Without IMC effect, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ slightly increases and then decreases with magnetic fields. Taking into account of the IMC effect by $G(eB)$, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ monotonically increases with magnetic fields, and by $T_0(eB)$, it is a nonmonotonic function of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Charged Lepton Flavour Violating Meson Decays in Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of neutrino oscillations demands the existence of flavour violation in charged lepton sector. The relation between the branching ratios of different charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decay modes depends on the details of the neutrino mass model. In this work, we consider the three types of simple seesaw mechanisms of neutrino masses and study the correlation between the radiative CLFV decays and the meson CLFV decays. We find that the meson CLFV decay branching ratios are negligibly small in type-II seesaw mechanism whereas they are constrained to be at least three (two) orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative CLFV decay branching ratios in the case of type-I (type-III) seesaw mechanism. Thus the relationship between these two modes of CLFV decays helps in distinguishing between different types of seesaw mechanism. If, the branching ratios of CLFV decays of mesons are larger than those of radiative CLFV decays, it provides a strong hint that the neutrino mass generating mechanism is more complicated than simple seesaw.</description>

      <title>Global fit to the 2HDM with generic sources of flavour violation using \textsf{GAMBIT}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global statistical analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model with generic sources of flavour violation using \textsf{GAMBIT}. This is particularly interesting in light of deviations from the Standard Model predictions observed in $b\to c\tau\bar \nu$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions as well as the indications for a charged Higgs with a mass of 130\,GeV in top quark decays. Including all relevant constraints from precision, flavour and collider observables, we find that it is possible to simultaneously explain both the charged and neutral current $B$ anomalies. We study the impact of using different values for the $W$ mass and the Standard Model prediction for $g-2$ of the muon and provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as lepton flavour violation searches at Belle II and Higgs coupling strength measurements at the high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring quark polarization and spin correlations in $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ samples at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations have been explored very little for quarks other than the top. Utilizing the partial preservation of the quark's spin information in baryons in the jet produced by the quark, we examine possible analysis strategies for ATLAS and CMS to measure the quark polarization and spin correlations in $pp\to q\bar{q}$ processes. We find polarization measurements for the $b$ and $c$ quarks to be feasible, even with the currently available datasets. Spin correlation measurements for $b\bar{b}$ are possible using the CMS Run 2 parked data, while such measurements for $c\bar{c}$ will become possible with higher integrated luminosity. We also provide leading-order QCD predictions for the polarization and spin correlations expected in the $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ samples with the relevant cuts. These proposed analyses can provide new information on the polarization transfer from quarks to baryons, measure entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the $b\bar b$ final state, and might even be sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: Spin one bottomonium Bethe-Salpeter equation coupled to quark and gluon propagators is solved in class of nontrivial linear gauges.
  The interaction kernels are based on known gluon propagator extrapolated from lattice and it contains a very little phenomenology beyond. First numerical results are obtained in Feynman gauge.
  We obtain good agreement with the experiment data for vector and axial vector bottomonia bellow $BB$ threshold. We open the problem of infrared divergences as an unsolved issue in the functional formalism for nontrivial value of gauge fixing parameter.</description>

      <title>Double strangeness pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons in the $\Xi_b \to \Xi\ J/\Psi\ \phi$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility that four $\Xi$ resonances $(\Xi(1620)$, $\Xi(1690)$, $\Xi(1820)$, $\Xi(1950))$ could correspond to pentaquark states, in the form of meson-baryon bound systems. We also explore the possible existence of doubly strange pentaquarks with hidden charm $(P_{css})$ and find two candidates structured in a similar form, at energies of $4493~{\rm MeV}$ and $4630~{\rm MeV}$. The meson-baryon interaction is built from t-channel meson exchange processes which are evaluated using effective Lagrangians. Moreover we analyse the $\Xi_b\to\Xi~J/\psi~\phi$ decay process, which permits exploring the existence of the heavy double strange pentaquark, as well as other exotic hadrons, in the three different two-body invariant mass spectra of the emitted particles. In the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum, we analyse the nature of the $X(4140)$ and $X(4160)$ resonances. In the $J/\psi\Xi$ invariant mass spectrum, we study the signal produced by the doubly strange pentaquark, where we conclude that it has a good chance to be detected in this reaction if its mass is around $4580-4680~{\rm MeV}$. Finally, in the $\phi\Xi$ spectrum we study the likelihood to detect the $\Xi(2500)$ state.</description>

      <title>Effective two-loop background contributions to $g_e-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the utility of examining background effects from ultralight dark matter on precision measurements. This effect enhances seemingly benign contributions to the level that experiments are sensitive to them. In this work, we examine the consequences of the effective axion-like particles coupling to photons in a background of axion-like particle dark matter. This analysis leads to new constraints on the product of the axion electron and axion photon coupling. Furthermore, since the axion photon coupling is generated, at one loop, by a pseudoscalar Yukawa coupling, this calculation can also be applied to constraining the axion-like particles coupling to the electron at the two-loop level. This contribution often dominates due to the fact that the one-loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron from a pseudoscalar is momentum suppressed.</description>

      <title>General Signals for Charged Lepton Flavor Violating Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the most general phenomenology of charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decays of muon and tau leptons to the three body final states $(\bar{e}ee, \bar{\mu}\mu\mu, \bar{e}\mu\mu, \bar{\mu}\mu e,\bar{\mu}ee, \bar{e}e\mu)$. By constructing a complete basis of operators at each dimension, we derive the most general amplitudes for these decay processes. By considering constraints from unitarity and LEP, we show that operators of mass dimension 6 and 7 are the most likely to be observed in next generation experiments. Focusing on these dimensions, we compute the results of unpolarized (spin-averaged) decays parameterized in terms of the invariant masses of the daughter particles. For the $\mu \rightarrow \bar{e}ee$ decay, we also compute the differential decay rate for polarized decays, in anticipation of the experimental search Mu3e, which expects to have a muon beam with $\sim 90\%$ polarization. To determine the extent to which the operators may be distinguished experimentally, we plot the differential distributions for each operator, showing that the differential distributions leave only a few possible degenerate explanations. These results are adapted to treat $\ell\to \ell' \nu \bar{\nu}$, where the angular distribution of the outgoing charged lepton has enhanced distinguishing power. With many Standard Model extensions predicting these CLFV decays, these results will better enable upcoming searches to identify and/or constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space. Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth would provide very important information for the prediction of space weather effects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity. In this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the first time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of charged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic field.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used to explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the powerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high significance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in 2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by spacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\pm$ 0:12 days. The displacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF model, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\pm$ 0:04 days. This deviation may provide valuable insights into the magnetic field structure, which can improve space weather research.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bulk Properties of Charged Particles in Different $\eta$ Bins Using a Modified Tsallis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the double-differential $p_T$ distributions of charged particles in twelve distinct pseudorapidity regions of equal width in $pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV. Utilizing the modified Tsallis function with mean transverse flow velocity, our study demonstrates a very good agreement between experimental data and the model employed. The fit quality is consistently high across all $p_T$ ranges, as assessed by Data/Fit panels accompanying each plot. Extracted parameters, including kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_0$), transverse flow velocity ($\beta_T$), non-extensivity parameter ($q$) and mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ dependencies are shown on pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and collision energy ($\sqrt{s}$). $T_0$, $\beta_T$ and $\langle p_T \rangle$ exhibit a decreasing trend with increasing $\eta$ due to lower in energy transfer along high $\eta$ regions, while they show a heightened sensitivity to $\sqrt{s}$. $q$ increases with $\eta$, indicating a closer thermal equilibrium in mid-$\eta$ particles. The paper also explores correlations among these parameters, emphasizing relationships between $T_0$, $\beta_T$, $q$ and $\langle p_T \rangle$. Our study provides valuable insights into the thermal and dynamic characteristics of high-energy proton-proton collisions, contributing to the broader understanding of the bulk properties of nuclear matter produced in these interactions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Covariant Horava-Lifshitz Gravity from precision measurement of planetary gravitomagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of Einstein's theory, Horava-Lifshitz has attracted significant interests due to its healthy ultraviolet behavior. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the Horava-Lifshitz corrections on the gravitomagnetic field. We propose a new planetary gravitomagnetic field measurement method with the help of the space-based laser interferometry, which is further used to constrain the Horava-Lifshitz parameters. Our analysis shows that the high-precision laser gradiometers can indeed limit the parameters in Horava-Lifshitz gravity and improve the results by one or two orders when compared with the existing theories. Our novel method provides insights into constraining the parameters in the modified gravitational theory, which facilitates a deeper understanding of this complex framework and paving the way for potential technological advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>On Two Nucleons Near Unitarity with Perturbative Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the expansion of two-nucleon S-wave scattering phase shifts and pole parameters about Unitarity in Chiral Effective Field Theory with Perturbative Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO): the only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO consists of contributions from scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); N2LO adds only once-iterated OPE. We take advantage of the high degree of symmetry of the nontrivial fixed point at Unitarity, where Physics is universal and invariant under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. Both are explicitly but weakly broken in the Unitarity Expansion, including by OPE. This version applies in the Unitarity Window (45deg&lt;delta(k)&lt;135deg), including around the momentum scales k=mpi/2 and mpi set by branch points of OPE. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k&gt;100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. In the resulting $\chi$EFT with Perturbative Pions in the Unitarity Expansion, both channels describe PWAs and empirical pole parameters well within several mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k&gt;mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with the scale $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}$=300MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore hypothesise: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence, i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO.</description>

      <title>Connecting Inflation to the NANOGrav 15-year Data Set via Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Polarization Characteristics of the Hyperactive FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio bursts of extragalactic origin characterized by millisecond durations and high luminosities. We report on observations of FRB 20240114A conducted with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at frequencies ranging from 720 to 920 MHz. A total of 429 bursts were detected, with a single observation recording 359 bursts over 1.38 hours, corresponding to a burst rate of 260 bursts per hour. The average rotation measures (RMs) were $349.2 \pm 1.0$ rad m$^{-2}$ on February 23, 2024, and $360.4 \pm 0.4$ rad m$^{-2}$ on March 1, 2024. Of the 297 bursts with detected RMs, 72% have a linear polarization fraction greater than 90%, and 14% exhibit circular polarization with a signal-to-noise ratio $&gt; 5$. Our sample also displayed polarization angle swings. We compare the linear polarization of FRB 20240114A with that of FRB 20201124A, FRB 20220912A, and non-repeating FRBs. The mean linear polarization fraction for non-repeating FRBs is 58%. In contrast, the mean linear polarization fraction for the three repeating FRBs is 94%, which is significantly higher than that of the non-repeating FRBs. Under the T-test, the three repeating FRBs have similar linear polarization distributions, but these distributions differ from those of the non-repeating FRBs. This suggests that non-repeating FRBs may have different emission mechanisms or are subject to depolarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for processes involving top quarks, such as top quark-antiquark pair production, depend on fundamental standard model (SM) parameters like the top quark mass or potentially receive contributions from beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics. By comparing predictions with measurements performed at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, SM parameters can be determined precisely, or measurements can be used as a powerful probe for BSM physics. In these proceedings, recent results measuring SM and top quark properties are reported, as well as new results of searches for BSM physics for charged lepton flavor violation, flavor changing neutral currents, and baryon number violation are presented.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that enhanced early galaxy formation can generically arise in axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) models with a delayed onset of axion field oscillation. In these models, the formation of localized massive objects enhances structure formation, potentially addressing the excess recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while remaining consistent with existing constraints. We identify viable parameter space with the ALP mass in the range of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-19}~\rm eV$. In addition, we show that the ALP parameter regions of interest can lead to intriguing complementary signatures in the small-scale structure of DM halos and existing experimental searches for ALPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the top quark, the most massive elementary particle yet known, has given us a distinct window into investigating the physics of the Standard Model and Beyond. With a plethora of top quarks to be produced in the High Luminosity era of the LHC, the exploration of its rare decays holds great promise in revealing potential new physics phenomena. We consider higher-dimensional operators contributing to top decays in the SMEFT and its extension by a light singlet species of spin 0, 1/2, or 1, and exhibit that the HL-LHC may observe many exotic top decays in a variety of channels. Light singlets which primarily talk to the SM through such a top interaction may also lead to distinctive long-lived particle signals. Searching for such long-lived particles in top-quark decays has the additional advantage that the SM decay of the other top quark in the same event provides a natural trigger.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of $\psi(1S,2S)$ and $\eta_{c}(1S,2S)$ to $D_{(s)}$ in the covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to the strong and electromagnetic decay modes, the $\psi(1S,2S)$ and $\eta_{c}(1S,2S)$ can also decay via the weak interaction. Such weak decays can be detected by the high-luminosity heavy-flavor experiments. At present, some of the semileptonic and nonleptonic $J/\Psi$ weak decays have been measured at BESIII. Researching for these charmonium weak decays to $D_{(s)}$ meson can provide a platform to check of the standard model (SM) and probe new physics (NP). So we investigate the semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of $\psi(1S,2S)$ and $\eta_{c}(1S,2S)$ to $D_{(s)}$ within the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). With form factors of the transitions $\psi(1S,2S)\to D_{(s)}$ and $\eta_{c}(1S,2S)\to D_{(s)}$ calculated under the CLFQM, we predict and discuss some physical observables, such as the branching ratios, the longitudinal polarizations $f_{L}$ and the forward-backward asymmetries $A_{FB}$. One can find that the Cabibbo-favored semi-leptonic decay channels $\psi(1S,2S)\to D_{s}^{-}\ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=e,\mu$ and the nonleptonic decay modes $\psi(1S,2S)\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}$ have relatively large branching ratios of the order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$, which are most likely to be accessible at the future high-luminosity experiments.</description>

      <title>Scattering from an external field in quantum chromodynamics at high energies: from foundations to interdisciplinary connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the factorization of the $S$-matrix elements in the context of particle scattering off an external field, which can serve as a model for the field of a large nucleus. The factorization takes the form of a convolution of light cone wave functions describing the physical incoming and outgoing states in terms of bare partons, and products of Wilson lines. The latter represent the interaction between the bare partons and the external field. Specializing to elastic scattering amplitudes of onia at very high energies, we introduce the color dipole model, which formulates the calculation of the modulus-squared of the wave functions in quantum chromodynamics with the help of a branching random walk, and the scattering amplitudes as observables on this classical stochastic process. Methods developed for general branching processes produce analytical formulas for the asymptotics of such observables, and thus enable one to derive exact large-rapidity expressions for onium-nucleus cross sections, from which electron-nucleus cross sections may be inferred.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Maximum Conformality Correctly Resolves the Renormalization-Scheme-Dependence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify a serious misinterpretation and consequent misuse of the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). In a recently published article~\cite{Stevenson:2023isz}, P.~M. Stevenson has claimed that ``the PMC is ineffective and does nothing to resolve the renormalization-scheme-dependence problem", concluding incorrectly that the success of PMC predictions is due to the PMC being a ``laborious, \emph{ad hoc}, back-door" version of the principle of minimum sensitivity (PMS). We show that such conclusions are incorrect, deriving from a misinterpretation of the PMC and overestimation of the applicability of the PMS. The purpose of the PMC is to achieve precise fixed-order pQCD predictions, free from conventional renormalization-scheme and renormalization-scale ambiguities. We demonstrate that the PMC predictions satisfy all of the self-consistency conditions of the renormalization group and standard renormalization-group invariance; the PMC predictions are thus independent of any initial choice of renormalization scheme and scale. The scheme independence of the PMC is also ensured by Commensurate Scale Relations which relate different observables to each other. Owing to the elimination of the factorially-divergent renormalon terms, the PMC series has better convergence behavior than the conventional series; it substantially suppresses any residual scale dependence due to unknown higher-order terms; and it thus provides a reliable basis for estimating the contributions of unknown higher-order terms. Thus, the PMC, based on the standard renormalization group invariance, has a rigorous foundation, eliminates the factorially divergent renormalon contributions, as well as eliminating unnecessary systematic errors which underly high-precision pQCD predictions. The PMC can thus be rigorously applied to virtually all high-energy hadronic processes.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Hadronic $B$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform fits to $B \to PP$ decays, where $B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$ and the pseudoscalar $P = \{\pi, K\}$, under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry [SU(3)$_F$]. Although the fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays individually are good, the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. The above results are rigorous, group-theoretically - no dynamical assumptions have been made. When one adds an assumption motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the pion and meson dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recent MIT lattice QCD data for the pion's gravitational form factors are, in the covered momentum transfer range, fully consistent with the meson dominance principle. In particular, the $2^{++}$ component can be accurately saturated with the $f_2(1270)$ meson, whereas the $0^{++}$ component with the $\sigma$ meson. To incorporate the large width of the $\sigma$, we use the dispersion relation with the spectral density obtained from analyses of the physical pion scattering data. Effects of the pion mass are estimated within Chiral Perturbation Theory and are found to be small between the lattice and the physical point. We also discuss the implications of the perturbative QCD constraints at high momentum transfers, leading to specific sum rules for the spectral densities of the gravitational form factors, and argue that these densities cannot be of definite sign.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Physical Priors into Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new machine-learning-based anomaly detection strategy for comparing data with a background-only reference (a form of weak supervision). The sensitivity of previous strategies degrades significantly when the signal is too rare or there are many unhelpful features. Our Prior-Assisted Weak Supervision (PAWS) method incorporates information from a class of signal models to significantly enhance the search sensitivity of weakly supervised approaches. As long as the true signal is in the pre-specified class, PAWS matches the sensitivity of a dedicated, fully supervised method without specifying the exact parameters ahead of time. On the benchmark LHC Olympics anomaly detection dataset, our mix of semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning is able to extend the sensitivity over previous methods by a factor of 10 in cross section. Furthermore, if we add irrelevant (noise) dimensions to the inputs, classical methods degrade by another factor of 10 in cross section while PAWS remains insensitive to noise. This new approach could be applied in a number of scenarios and pushes the frontier of sensitivity between completely model-agnostic approaches and fully model-specific searches.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Kaon Decays to ALPs at Fixed Target Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of fixed target experiments to hadronically-coupled axion like particles (ALPs) produced in kaon decays, with a particular emphasis on current and upcoming short-baseline neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that below the kaon decay mass threshold ($m_a &lt; m_K - m_\pi$) kaon decay is the dominant production mechanism for ALPs at neutrino experiments, larger by many orders of magnitude than production in psuedo-scalar mixing. Such axions can be probed principally by the di-photon and di-muon final states. In the latter case, even if the axion does not couple to muons at tree level, such a coupling is induced by the renormalization group flow from the UV scale. We reinterpret prior results by CHARM and MicroBooNE through these channels and show that they constrain new areas of heavy axion parameter space. We also show projections of the sensitivity of the SBN and DUNE experiments to axions through these channels, which reach up to multiple decades higher in the axion decay constant beyond existing constraints. DUNE projects to have a sensitivity competitive with other world-leading upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Upper limit on the axion-photon coupling from Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markarian 421 is a well-known nearby BL Lac blazar at the redshift $z=0.031$. Many previous works were investigated to constrain the axion-photon coupling from its TeV gamma-ray observations, showing the upper limit on the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 2.0\times 10^{-11} \rm \, GeV^{-1}$ for the axion mass $[5.0\times10^{-10} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 5.0\times10^{-7} \, {\rm eV}]$. While in this work, we obtain a more stringent upper limit on the axion-photon coupling from the 1038 days gamma-ray observations of the blazar Markarian 421. The long-term gamma-ray spectra are measured by the collaborations Large Area Telescope on board NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory from 2015 June to 2018 July. We show the best-fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Markarian 421 under the null and axion hypotheses. Then we set the axion-photon limit in the $\{m_a, \, g_{a\gamma}\}$ plane. The 99% $\rm C.L.$ upper limit set by Markarian 421 is $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4.0\times 10^{-12} \rm \, GeV^{-1}$ for the axion mass $[1.0\times10^{-9} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 1.0\times10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}]$. It is the most stringent upper limit in this axion mass region.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ \ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 13.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(53.5\pm 10.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Portal Spin-1 Dark Matter with Parity-Violating Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the spin-1 $U(1)_X$ gauged field $X$ with $Z_2$ odd dark parity to evade the current strong constraints on kinetic mixing. Then, $X$ becomes stable and a candidate for the dark matter. The lowest mass dimension of interaction is six, and the type is the Higgs portal. Two types of dim-6 operators are introduced. We consider the freeze-out dark matter scenario. With the limit of null momentum transfer, a parity odd operator is free from the direct detection constraints. Accordingly, the strong constraints on a parity even operator indicate turning on this parity odd operator to realize the dark matter relic density of the Universe. With the 1 TeV cut-off scale, our dark matter of around 400 GeV mass can explain the dark matter relic density and is allowed from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment of the direct detection.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the excesses in associated di-photon production at 152 GeV in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistically significant excesses exist at around 152 GeV in associated di-photon production ($\gamma\gamma+X$) in the sidebands of SM Higgs analyses of ATLAS (using the full run-2 dataset). They are most pronounced in the single-$\tau$, missing-transverse-energy, four-jet and $\geqslant1\ell+\!\geqslant1b$-jet channels ($\approx3\sigma$) and can be explained by the Drell-Yan production of new Higgs bosons, i.e. $pp\to W^*\to H^\pm H^0$. We first examine the excesses in a simplified model approach, considering that $H^\pm$ decays to $\tau\nu$, $WZ$ or $tb$. Both the $\tau\nu$ and $tb$ decay modes individually lead to a significance of $\lessapprox4\sigma$ while for $WZ$ one can obtain at most $3.5\sigma$. This is because the decays of $WZ$ lead to multiple leptons contributing to the two-lepton channel which does not show an excess at 152 GeV. Next, we consider two-Higgs-doublet models where the charged Higgs does not decay to $WZ$ at tree-level, finding a significance of $\gtrapprox4\sigma$ for a branching ratio of the new neutral Higgs to photons of $\approx$2%. Even though this branching fraction is quite sizable, it can be obtained in composite models or via the Lagrangian term $\lambda_6 H_1^\dagger H_1 H_2^\dagger H_1+{\rm h.c.}$ breaking the commonly imposed $Z_2$ symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In certain kinematic and particle mass configurations, triangle singularities may lead to line-shapes which mimic the effects of resonances. This well-known effect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The goal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau equations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit two- and three-body unitarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we find a new signal of dark matter (DM) through an intensive gamma ray burst (GRB), called GRB 221009A. This indirect detection approach devotes to the decay of DM particles into high energy (HE) photons. In this context, a singlet scalar DM generated at the redshift of the GRB is up-scattered by the high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) during its propagation to Earth. This highly boosted DM then possesses a high flux and undergoes a dominant di-photon decay before reaching the detector. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) probes such energetic gamma rays whereby has recorded a 18 TeV event for the aforementioned GRB.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal Love numbers of Kerr-like compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to compute the tidal response of a Kerr-like compact object in terms of its reflectivity, compactness, and spin, both in the static and the frequency-dependent case. Here we focus on the low-frequency regime, which can be solved fully analytically. We highlight some remarkable novel features, in particular: i) Even in the zero-frequency limit, the tidal Love numbers (TLNs) depend on the linear-in-frequency dependence of the object's reflectivity in a nontrivial way. ii) Intriguingly, the static limit of the frequency-dependent TLNs is discontinuous, therefore the static TLNs differ from the static limit of the (phenomenologically more interesting) frequency-dependent TLNs. This shows that earlier findings regarding the static TLNs of ultracompact objects correspond to a measure-zero region in the parameter space, though the logarithmic behavior of the TLNs in the black hole limit is retained. iii) In the non-rotating case, the TLNs generically vanish in the zero-frequency limit (just like for a black hole), except when the reflectivity is ${\cal R}=1+{\cal O}(M\omega)$, in which case they vanish with a model-dependent scaling, which is generically logarithmic, in the black-hole limit. The TLNs initially grow with frequency, for any nonzero reflectivity, and then display oscillations and resonances tied up with the quasi-normal modes of the object. iv) For rotating compact objects, the TLNs decrease when the reflectivity decreases or the rotation parameter increases. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork to develop model-independent tests of the nature of compact objects using tidal effects in gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD estimates of thermal photon production from the QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal photons produced in heavy-ion collision experiments are an important observable for understanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The thermal photon rate from the QGP at a given temperature can be calculated from the spectral function of the vector current correlator. Extraction of the spectral function from the lattice correlator is known to be an ill-conditioned problem, as there is no unique solution for a spectral function for a given lattice correlator with statistical errors. The vector current correlator, on the other hand, receives a large ultraviolet contribution from the vacuum, which makes the extraction of the thermal photon rate difficult from this channel. We therefore consider the difference between the transverse and longitudinal part of the spectral function, only capturing the thermal contribution to the current correlator, simplifying the reconstruction significantly. The lattice correlator is calculated for light quarks in quenched QCD at $T=470~$MeV ($\sim 1.5\, T_c$), as well as in 2+1 flavor QCD at $T=220~$MeV ($\sim 1.2 \, T_{pc}$) with $m_{\pi}=320$ MeV. In order to quantify the non-perturbative effects, the lattice correlator is compared with the corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{LPM}^{\text{LO}}$ estimate of correlator. The reconstruction of the spectral function is performed in several different frameworks, ranging from physics-informed models of the spectral function to more general models in the Backus-Gilbert method and Gaussian Process regression. We find that the resulting photon rates agree within errors.</description>

      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolution, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model and can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos and gamma rays from beta decays in an active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that TeV neutrinos and high-energy gamma rays detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can simultaneously be explained in a model based on the beta decays of neutrons produced in the photodisintegration of 4He nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintegration of nuclei occurs at energies above several PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The TeV gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, which agrees with the observations of NGC 1068 showing a gamma-ray deficit as compared to the expectations from proton-photon interactions. Furthermore, the synchrotron and inverse Compton gamma-ray flux associated with protons' Bethe-Heitler pair production and the photopion processes in the jet can be consistent with the observed gamma-ray flux at GeV energies for a plausible range of magnetic fields of jets. This scenario, combining beta decay and Bethe-Heitler, can be applied to other jet Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. Future measurements of the neutrino flavor ratio can help confirm the beta-decay origin of the observed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic histories with a stiff era through Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of gravitational-wave background searches to constrain cosmic histories characterised by a stiff equation of state, preceded by a period of matter domination. Such a scenario leads to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave spectrum originating from cosmological inflation. Assuming instant transitions between distinct epochs, which allows an analytical treatment of the gravitational-wave spectrum, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis to derive constraints from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Additionally, we consider a smooth transition, employing an axion-like particle physics model, and highlight the difference with the instant transition approximation. We then forecast detection prospects for such a cosmic history through future gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster -- Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</description>

      <title>The Smile of Cheshire Cat At High Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Charming Darwin: the evolution of QCD parameters across different species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of measurements of spectral moments of inclusive charm decays with BESIII. The rich and uniquely clean data set of charm mesons and baryons at BESIII offers a unique laboratory to study the evolution of Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) parameters across different charm hadron species and to shed light on the interplay between heavy quark dynamics and light quark effects. The HQE in terms of inverse powers of the heavy meson mass is well-established in beauty decays, however due to the lighter charm mass its applicability to charm remains an open question. To date no determination of the HQE parameters, the kinetic energy, chromomagnetic moment and Darwin terms, has been attempted. A particular important role here is given to the Darwin and weak annihilation operators, whose values are important to predict lifetimes of heavy hadrons. Using a fast simulation for the BESIII detector response and predictions for spectral moments, we investigate the sensitivity to HQE parameters with today's and possible future data sets. In addition, we discuss the theory challenges for the HQE in charm and the experimental limitations. We further investigate the sensitivity of determining the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ with inclusive semileptonic charm decays.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Dynamics and X-ray Burst Characteristics in the Low-Mass X-ray Binary EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface, notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \), indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems. Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm 0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in 2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.) reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution processes in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes as Astrophysical Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes. In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the black hole's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,$g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of "young" black holes that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$, if neutrinos are of Majorana nature. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>
