      <title>Development of a nonlinear plasma lens for achromatic beam transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new idea of a nonlinear active plasma lens, as part of a larger transport lattice for achromatic electron beam transport. The proposed implementation is based on using the Hall effect in a plasma and is motivated by 1D-hydrodynamic simulations. The manufactured design is presented, including its undergoing experimental characterisation on the CLEAR beam-line at CERN.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of dark current mitigation by an over-inserted plug in a normal conducting VHF gun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The room temperature continuous wave (CW) very-high-frequency (VHF) gun is one of the candidates for the electron gun of the high-repetition-rate free-electron lasers (FELs). The VHF gun operates with a cathode gradient of ~ 20 MV/m and an accelerating voltage of ~ 750 kV. The gun dark current emission leads to beam loss along the FEL machine, therefore is a critical parameter for the performance of the CW gun. In this paper, we presents a systematic study of the dark current reduction of the VHF gun, including cathode region optimizations, dark current tracking simulations and measurements. Over-inserted cathode plugs were tested in two VHF guns of different acceleration gap sizes, and both demonstrated significant dark current reduction ratios of more than two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>KIT Superconducting Undulator Development -- Story of a successful industrial collaboration &amp; fute prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undulators are X-ray sources widely used in synchrotron storage rings and free-electron laser facilities. With the commercial availability of low-temperature superconductors, a new type of undulator was born, the superconducting undulator (SCU). In this context, the industrial cooperation between the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Bilfinger Nuclear and Energy Transition GmbH started more than 15 years ago. Since then, many projects have been successfully completed, leading to the production of the world's leading full-scale commercial SCUs based on conduction cooling. Starting with the SCU15, the first of its kind installed SCU providing light to a beamline, followed by the SCU20 installed and still in operation at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator. The successful realisation of such SCUs has required the simultaneous development of appropriate measurement facilities such as CASPER I and CASPER II.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that show outstanding agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce muon beams with GeV energies and fluxes, at a few meters from the source, up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than cosmic ray muons. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high fluxes which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>A method for reversing the laser modulation in a Storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of coherent radiation generation remains a key direction in the advancement of storage ring light sources. Despite the potential of laser modulation in achieving this goal, it leads to a significant decline in the quality of the electron beam. Efforts to mitigate this decline have resulted in the proposal of demodulation schemes. However, implementing modulation and demodulation within the storage ring presents significant challenges due to dynamical and spatial constraints within straight sections. In this study, we propose a straightforward and easily implementable method for achieving reversible laser modulation in a storage ring. Notably, our approach circumvents the need for special storage ring requirements, such as lengthy straight sections or bypass section. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial restoration of beam quality following demodulation. This innovative scheme holds great promise for the realization of high repetition rate coherent storage ring light sources.</description>
