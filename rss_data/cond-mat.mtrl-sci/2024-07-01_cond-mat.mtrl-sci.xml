      <title>Preparation of Sol-Gel Random Micro Lens Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of random micro lens array (rMLA) breaks the periodicity of micro lens array (MLA), suppressing coherence in the homogenization process, thereby achieving better spot homogenization effects. Sol-gel rMLA exhibits strong adaptability and high laser tolerance, making it valuable for laser beam control applications. However, the cracking tendency during the drying process of sol-gel is a challenge. This paper successfully prepares sol-gel random micro lens arrays through nanoimprint lithography, thoroughly analyzing the cracking mechanism and resolving the cracking issue during the drying process of sol-gel. The manufactured sol-gel random micro lenses exhibit good surface profile accuracy, uniformity, and excellent light source shaping effects. The energy utilization efficiency of various types of rMLA is approximately 90%, with rectangular and hexagonal rMLAs achieving uniformity of light spots of over 80%.</description>

      <title>Strong atomic reconstruction in twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential and continuum model approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of atomic positions to their optimal structural arrangement is crucial for understanding the emergence of new physical behavior in long scale superstructures in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials. The amount of deviation from a rigid moir\'e structure will depend on the elastic properties of the constituent monolayers which for the twisted bilayer - the more flexible the monolayers are, the lower the energy required to deform the layers to maximize the areas with an energetically optimal interlayer arrangement of atoms. We investigate this atomic reconstruction for twisted bilayers of highly flexible InSe. Results using two methods are demonstrated - first we train a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to enable fully atomistic relaxations of small-twist-angle large-length-scale moir\'e supercells while retaining density functional theory (DFT) level accuracy. We find substantial out-of-plane corrugation and in-plane domain formation for a wide range of twist angles and moir\'e length scales. We then adapt an existing continuum approach and show that it can reproduce some, but not all, features of the fully atomistic calculations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of TPDH-Nanotube: Insights from Ab initio and Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexa-graphene (TPDH) is a new 2D carbon allotrope with attractive electronic and mechanical properties. It is composed of tetragonal, pentagonal, and hexagonal carbon rings. When TPDH-graphene is sliced into quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structures like nanoribbons, it exhibits a range of behaviors, from semi-metallic to semiconducting. An alternative approach to achieving these desirable electronic (electronic confinement and/or non-zero electronic band gap) properties is the creation of nanotubes (TPDH-NT). In the present work, we carried out a comprehensive study of TPDH-NTs combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Classical Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD). Our results show structural stability and a chiral dependence on mechanical properties. Similarly to standard carbon nanotubes, TPDH-NT can be metallic or semiconductor. MD results show Young's modulus values exceeding $700$ GPa, except for nanotubes with very small radii. However, certain chiral TPDH-NTs (n,m) display values both below and above $700$ GPa, particularly for those with small radii. The analyses of the angle and C-C bond length distributions underscore the significance of the tetragonal and pentagonal rings in determining the mechanical response of TPDH-NTs (n,0) and (0,n), respectively.</description>

      <title>Effect of interfacial Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the microstructure and mechanical properties of textured alumina densified by ultrafast high-temperature sintering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alumina microplatelets coated with a small amount of Fe3O4 can be oriented via a rotating magnetic field to create texture. After ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS), Fe atoms are found at the grain boundaries and within the grains, influencing the mechanical properties. Here, we compare the microstructure and mechanical properties of textured alumina prepared with and without Fe3O4 and sintered using UHS or conventional sintering (CS). Microstructural analysis using electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) indicates that Fe3O4 induces crystallographic defects in the ceramic after UHS. Nanoindentation measurements enlighten that the presence of Fe3O4 leads to plastic flow that increases the energy dissipation, reaching ~122 % at a maximum load of 1900 mN compared to pristine samples. Overall, due to the concentrated effects of Fe3O4 after UHS, the flexural strength and fracture toughness values are higher than the other two samples, reaching values of ~287 MPa and 7 MPa.m0.5, respectively. These results could be leveraged to produce stronger and tougher ceramics.</description>

      <title>Impact of interface defects on the band alignment and performance of TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is essential for enhancing their performance, improving their stability, and making them commercially viable for large-scale deployment in solar energy harvesting applications. Point defects, like vacancies, have a dual role, as they can inherently provide a proper doping, but they can also reduce the collected current by trap-assisted recombination. Moreover, they can play an active role in ion migration. Using {\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations we investigate the changes in the band alignment induced by interfacial vacancy defects in a TiO$_2$/MAPI/Cu$_2$O based PSC. Depending on the type of the vacancy (Ti, Cu, O, Pb, I) in the oxide and perovskite materials, additional doping is superimposed on the already existing background. Their effect on the performance of the PSCs becomes visible, as shown by SCAPS simulations. The most significant impact is observed for $p$ type doping of TiO$_2$ and $n$ type doping of Cu$_2$O, while the effective doping of the perovskite layer affects one of the two interfaces. We discuss these results based on modification of the band structure near the active interfaces and provide further insights concerning the optimization of electron and hole collection.</description>

      <title>Unstable Retention Behavior in MIFIS FEFET: Accurate Analysis of the Origin by Absolute Polarization Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect-transistor (FEFET) has emerged as a scalable solution for 3D NAND and embedded flash (eFlash), with recent progress in achieving large memory window (MW) using metal-insulator-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MIFIS) gate stacks. Although the physical origin of the large MW in the MIFIS stack has already been discussed, its retention characteristics have not been explored yet. Here, we demonstrate MIFIS FEFET with a maximum MW of 9.7 V, and show that MIFIS FEFET has unstable retention characteristics, especially after erase. We discover the origin of the unstable retention characteristics and prove our hypothesis with absolute polarization measurement and different operation modes, showing that the unstable retention characteristics is a fundamental issue. Based on the understanding, we discuss a novel charge compensation model and promising engineering methodologies to achieve stable retention in MIFIS FEFET.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast carrier dynamics in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons studied by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy has been used to investigate ultrafast photo-induced charge carrier transport in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons. The picosecond THz photoconductivity first increases with an increasing pump fluence and then it saturates at high fluences. This behavior is due to an interplay between contributions of the directly photoexcited carriers and the secondary carriers, which are equilibrium conduction band carriers strongly heated by the carrier-carrier scattering process after the photoexcitation. This phenomenon leads to a non-monotonic variation of the carrier mobility and plasmonic resonance frequency as a function of the pump fluence and, at higher fluences, to a balance between a decreasing carrier scattering time and an increasing Drude weight. In addition, a weak carrier localization occurring at low pump fluences is progressively lifted as a result of increasing initial carrier temperature.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Quasiparticle Moir\'e States in Twisted Bilayer hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers host many emergent phenomena in which the electronic excitations (quasiparticles - QPs) are closely intertwined with the local stacking order. By inspecting twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), we show that non-local long-range interactions in large twisted systems cannot be reliably described by the local (high-symmetry) stacking and that the band gap variation (typically associated with the moir\'e excitonic potential) shows multiple minima with variable depth depending on the twist angle. We investigate twist angles of 2.45$^\circ$, 2.88$^\circ$, 3.48$^\circ$ and 5.09$^\circ$ using the GW approximation together with stochastic compression to analyze the QP state interactions. We find that band-edge QP hybridization is suppressed for intermediate angles which exhibit two distinct local minima in the moir\'e potential (at AA region and saddle point (SP)) which become degenerate for the largest system (2.45$^\circ$).</description>

      <title>Topological ferroelectric chirality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, an inherent property of most objects of the universe, is a dynamic research topic in material science, physics, chemistry, and biology. The fundamental appeal of this extensive study is supported by the technological quest to manufacture materials with configurable chiralities for emerging applications ranging from optoelectronics and photonics to pharmaceutics and medicine. Recent advances put forth ferroelectrics as a host of chiral topological states in the form of Bloch domain walls, skyrmions, merons, and Hopfions, offering thus a unique ground for making chirality switchable and tunable. Here we review current developments, milestones achieved, and future routes of chiral ferroelectric materials. We focus on insights into the topological origin of the chirality in the nanostructured ferroelectrics, bringing new controllable functionalities. We pay special attention to novel developments enabling tunability and manipulating the chiroptical response and enantioselectivity, leading to new applications in nano-optoelectronics, plasmonics, pharmaceutics, and bio-medical industries.</description>

      <title>A non-orthogonal representation of the chemical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to generate a fingerprint for crystalline materials that balances efficiency for machine processing and human interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed fingerprint has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition. To represent the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. By utilizing dimension reduction techniques we can construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of the thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties. Moreover, this compositional fingerprint can be used as a versatile input for machine learning algorithms, supplanting conventional one-hot representations of the chemical composition.</description>

      <title>Terahertz crystal-field transitions and quasi ferromagnetic magnon excitations in a noncollinear magnet for hybrid spin-wave computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of interactions between the crystal-field and unusual non-collinear spin arrangement in non-trivial magnets demands novel tools to unravel the mystery underneath. In this work, we study such interaction dynamics of crystal-field-excitations (CFE) and low-energy magnetic excitations in orthochromite TmCrO3 with controls of temperature and magnetic field using high-resolution magneto-terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy. The THz energy spectrum spanning 0.5-10 meV possesses a low-frequency spin-excitation (magnon) mode and a multitude of CFE modes at 10 K, all of which uniquely embody a range of phenomena. For the magnon mode, a temperature dependence of peak frequency is induced by magnetic interactions between Tm and Cr subsystems. While a change from blue- to red-shift of peak frequency of this mode marks the magnetization reversal transition, the spin reorientation temperature and change of magnetic anisotropy are depicted by different features of field- and temperature-dependent peak frequency dynamics. The modes corresponding to CFE are robust and laden with a multitude of sub-modes which are attributes of non-trivial interactions across different transitions. These modes are suppressed only upon substitution of Tb3+ at Tm3+ site, which suggests a dominant role of single-ion anisotropy in controlling entire THz excitations spectra. Overall, this remarkable range of phenomena seen through the unique lens of all-optical THz tools provides deeper insights into the origin of magnetic phases in systems with complex interactions between rare-earth and transition metal ions and provides a multitude of a novel combination of closely spaced modes for emerging hybrid spin-wave computation.</description>

      <title>Interface-Induced Ferromagnetism in lateral NiBr2 and NiCl2 Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for future information storing and processing devices. There are different routes for stabilizing the skyrmions. Understanding the interplay mechanism between different scenarios of skyrmion formation is one key factor that can reveal new paths for controlling skyrmion phases. Inspired by the flexibility of two-dimensional materials that offer an exciting playground for manipulating spin textures, we conducted \textit{ab initio} simulations and utilized four-state spin framework to determine magnetic parameters of lateral heterostructure formed by NiBr2 and NiCl2 Monolayers. The obtained spin interaction parameters are utilized to determine the skyrmionic phases via Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation results suggest three distinct phase transition mechanisms exist in the present system. Namely, examination of heat capacity versus temperature curve obtained from average anisotropic exchange energy yields a phase transition between paramagnetic and spin-spiral states at $5$K for pristine NiBr2, a paramagnetic-mixed skyrmion state transition occurs at 17 K for pristine NiCl2, and a high-temperature ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition at T=80 K is observed for the heterostructure region, indicating that some kind of intrinsic ferromagnetism may originate at the interface of pristine Janus structures.</description>

      <title>Scanning acoustic microscopy characterization of cold sprayed coatings deposited on grooved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of non-planar substrate surface on homogeneity and quality of cold sprayed (CS) deposits was studied by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Fe coatings were cold sprayed onto Al substrates containing artificially introduced grooves of square- and trapezoid-shaped geometries, with flat or cylindrical bottoms. The Al substrates were either wrought or cold sprayed, to comprehend their prospective influence on the Fe coatings build-up. SAM was then used to assess morphological properties of the materials from the cross-view and top-view directions. The microstructure below the surface of the studied samples was visualized by measuring the amplitudes of the reflection echoes and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The SAM analysis revealed that the regions of coating imperfections around the grooves are larger than what is suggested by standard scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Furthermore, we found that the seemingly non-influenced coating regions that appear perfectly homogeneous and dense in SEM do, in fact, possess heterogeneous microstructure associated with the individual CS nozzle passes.</description>

      <title>MOSP: A User-interface Package for Simulating Metal Nanoparticle Structure and Reactivity under Operando Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19841v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structures of metal nanoparticles (NPs) significantly influence their catalytic reactivities. Recent in situ experimental observations of dramatic structural changes in NPs have underscored the need to establish a dynamic structure-property relationship that accounts for the reconstruction of NPs in reactive environments. Here, we present the MOSP, a free and open-source graphical user interface (GUI) package designed to simulate the structure and reactivity of metal NPs under operando conditions. MOSP integrates two models: the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model predicting equilibrium metal NP structures under specific reaction conditions and the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model simulating the reaction dynamics. This combination allows for the exploration of the dynamic structure-property relationships of NPs. MOSP enhances user accessibility through its intuitive GUI, facilitating easy input, post-processing, and visualization of simulation data. This article is the release note of MOSP, focusing on its implementation and functionality.</description>

      <title>Orbital Torque in Rare-Earth Transition-Metal Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital currents have recently emerged as a promising tool to achieve electrical control of the magnetization in thin-film ferromagnets. Efficient orbital-to-spin conversion is required in order to torque the magnetization. Here we show that the injection of an orbital current in a ferrimagnetic GdyCo100-y alloy generates strong orbital torques whose sign and magnitude can be tuned by changing the Gd content and temperature. The effective spin-orbital Hall angle reaches up to -0.25 in a GdyCo100-y/CuOx bilayer compared to +0.03 in Co/CuOx and +0.13 in GdyCo100-y/Pt. This behavior is attributed to the local orbital-to-spin conversion taking place at the Gd sites, which is about five times stronger and of the opposite sign relative to Co. Furthermore, we observe a manyfold increase in the net orbital torque at low temperature, which we attribute to the improved conversion efficiency following the magnetic ordering of the Gd and Co sublattices.</description>

      <title>Orientation reconstruction of transformation $\alpha$ titanium alloys via polarized light microscopy: methodology and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging microstructural characterization methods have received increased attention owing to their promise of relatively inexpensive and rapid measurement of polycrystalline surface morphology and crystallographic orientations. Among these nascent methods, polarized light microscopy (PLM) is attractive for characterizing alloys comprised of hexagonal crystals, but is hindered by its inability to measure complete crystal orientations. In this study, we explore the potential to reconstruct quasi-deterministic orientations for titanium microstructures characterized via PLM by considering the Burgers orientation relationship between the room temperature $\alpha$ (HCP) phase fibers measured via PLM, and the $\beta$ (BCC) phase orientations of the parent grains present above the transus temperature. We describe this method -- which is capable of narrowing down the orientations to one of four possibilities -- and demonstrate its abilities on idealized computational samples in which the parent $\beta$ microstructure is fully, unambiguously known. We further utilize this method to inform the instantiation of samples for crystal plasticity simulations, and demonstrate the significant improvement in deformation field predictions when utilizing this reconstruction method compared to using results from traditional PLM.</description>

Abstract: We focus on the potential possibilities for supporting Scanning Probe Microscopy measurements, emphasizing the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning as well as quantum computing. It turned out that Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in the experimental processes automation in routine operations, the algorithmic search for good sample regions, and shed light on the structure property relationships. Thus, it contributes to increasing the efficiency and accuracy of optical nanoscopy scanning probes. Moreover, the combination of Artificial Intelligence based algorithms and quantum computing may have a huge potential to increase the practical application of Scanning Probe Microscopy. The limitations were also discussed. Finally, we outline a research path for the improvement of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strain Compensation on Electron Mobilities in InAs Quantum Wells Grown on InP(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the InGaAs cladding layers to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</description>

      <title>Novel electronic structures from anomalous stackings in NbS$_2$ and MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in some transition metal dichalcogenides, minority regions of the cleaved sample surfaces show - unexpectedly and anomalously - a finite number of 2D electronic states instead of the expected 3D valence bands. In the case of NbS\textsubscript{2}, in addition to the typical spectrum associated with bulk 2Ha stacking, we also find minority regions with electronic structures consistent with few-layers of 3R stacking. In MoS\textsubscript{2} we find areas of both bulk 2Hc and 3R stackings, and regions exhibiting finite-layer quantisation of both types. We further find evidence for a more exotic 4Ha stacking of MoS\textsubscript{2}, in which the valence band maximum is quasi-2D. The results highlight how variation of the interlayer stacking of van der Waals materials beyond the commonly-reported bulk polytypes can yield novel electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping. In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. We end by comparing our results for the mobility and optical conductivity to those of the widely used relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. We find that this approximation generally underestimates the charge mobility when compared with our method, which is parameter free and directly simulates the thermal equilibrium diffusion of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons.</description>

Abstract: We propose a numerical tool to mimic the pulsed deposition of nanoparticles, a technique used to fabricate thin films from the deposition of nanoparticles upon a substrate. We employ such tool under different initial conditions, in particular exploring the effect of depositing an heterogeneous/homogenenous sample of nanoparticles in terms of their morphology (size and shape). We monitor how changing the nature of the building block affects the porosity and roughness of the grown nanofilms. We found a strong dependence on the size of the nanoparticles, following, in the low size regime, a growth of the porosity following a power law.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of layer skyrmions in twisted WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) twisted homobilayers have been established as an ideal platform for studying strong correlation phenomena, as exemplified by the recent discovery of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe2 and Chern insulators (CI) and unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2. In these systems, nontrivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunneling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report the direct observation of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of Rhombohedral-stacked (R-stacked) twisted WSe2 homobilayers. This observation is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy that separately resolves the {\Gamma}-valley and K-valley moir\'e electronic states. We show that {\Gamma}-valley states are subjected to a moir\'e potential with an amplitude of ~ 120 meV. At ~150 meV above the {\Gamma}-valley, the K-valley states are subjected to a weaker moir\'e potential of ~30 meV. Most significantly, we reveal opposite layer polarization of the K-valley at the MX and XM sites within the moir\'e unit cell, confirming the theoretically predicted skyrmion layer-texture. The dI/dV mappings allow the parameters that enter the continuum model for the description of moir\'e bands in twisted TMD bilayers to be determined experimentally, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of LDOS profile in real space and topology of topmost moir\'e band.</description>

Abstract: The THz Kerr effect measures the birefringence induced in an otherwise isotropic material by a strong THz pulse driving the Raman-active excitations of the systems. Here we provide experimental evidence of a sizable Kerr response in insulating SrTiO3 due to infrared-active lattice vibrations. Such a signal, named ionic Kerr effect, is associated with the simultaneous excitation of multiple phonons. Thanks to a theoretical modeling of the time, polarization and temperature dependence of the birefringence we can disentangle the ionic Kerr effect from the off-resonant electronic excitations, providing an alternative tunable mechanism to modulate the refractive index on ultrashort time-scales via infra-red active phonons.</description>

Abstract: Magnons are one of the carriers of angular momentum that are involved in the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets, but their contribution to the electronic dynamics and their interplay with other scattering process that occur during ultrafast demagnetization has not yet been studied in the framework of a microscopic dynamical model. The present paper presents such an investigation of electronic scattering dynamics in itinerant ferromagnets at the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals for the magnon distributions and spin-dependent electron distributions. In addition to electron-magnon scattering, we include spin-conserving and effective Elliott-Yafet like spin-flip electron-electron scattering processes and the influence of phonons. In our model system, the creation or annihilation of magnons leads to transitions between two spin-split electronic bands with energy and momentum conservation. Due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Coulomb scattering transitions between these bands are also possible, and we describe them on an equal footing in terms of Boltzmann scattering integrals. For an instantaneous carrier excitation process we analyze the influence of both interaction processes on the magnon and spin-dependent electron dynamics, and show that their interplay gives rise to an efficient creation of magnons at higher energies and wave vectors accompanied by only a small increase of the electronic spin polarization. These results present a microscopic dynamical scenario that shows how non-equilibrium magnons may decisively influence the magnetic response of a ferromagnet on ultrafast timescales.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the atomic and electronic structures of a single-layer Sb(110) rhombohedral crystal formed on an Au(111) substrate. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveal a pure two-dimensional (2D) Sb stripe structure, composed of a pair of Sb(110) unit cells located in a chiral configuration with mirror symmetry breaking perpendicular to the direction of the bright stripe. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and Sb-weighted band structure from density functional theory calculations, we report the unambiguous determination of Rashba spin-orbit coupled bands from the 2D Sb film, exhibiting a chiral symmetry in the electronic structure with the crossing points located at the ${\Gamma}$ point and the X point, respectively. Moreover, From dI/dV spectra and density of states (DOS) calculations, the quantum well (QW) Rashba-type states induced by the in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in the Sb stripe structure have been identified. Orbital decomposition of the projected band structure reveals that hybridization between Sb py states and Au states modifies the spin splitting of the QW states, attributed to the intrinsic strong SOC of Au states introduced into the QW states.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectric fluorite dioxides like hafnium (HfO2)-based materials are considered to be one of the most potential candidates for nowadays large-scale integrated-circuits (ICs). While zirconia (ZrO2)-based fluorites materials, which has the same structure as HfO2 and more abundant resources and lower cost of raw materials, is usually thought to be anti- or ferroelectric-like. Here we reported a giant ferroelectric remnant polarization (Pr) amounted to 53 {\mu}C/cm2 in orthorhombic ZrO2 thin film at room temperature. This ferroelectricity arises from an electric field induced anti-ferroelectric to ferroelectric phase transition which is particularly noticeable at 77 K. Our work reveals the intrinsic ferroelectricity in ZrO2 thin films and offers a new pathway to understand the ferroelectricity origin in fluorite oxides.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements. Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN, offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli, i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

Abstract: In the context of the ultrasonic determination of mechanical properties, it is common to use oblique incident waves to characterize fluid-immersed anisotropic samples. The lateral displacement of the ultrasonic field owing to leaky guided wave phenomena poses a challenge for data inversion because beam spreading is rarely well represented by plane-wave models. In this study, a finite beam model based on the angular spectrum method was developed to estimate the influence of the transducer shape and position on the transmitted signals. Additionally, anisotropic solids were considered so that the beam skewing effect was contemplated. A small-emitter large-receiver configuration was chosen, and the ideal shape and position of the receiving transducer were obtained through a meta-heuristic optimization approach with the goal of achieving a measurement system that sufficiently resembles plane-wave propagation. A polyvinylidene fluoride receiver was fabricated based on the findings and tested in three cases: a single-crystal silicon wafer, a lightly anisotropic stainless-steel plate, and a highly anisotropic composite plate. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the plane-wave model.</description>

      <title>MatText: Do Language Models Need More than Text &amp; Scale for Materials Modeling?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively representing materials as text has the potential to leverage the vast advancements of large language models (LLMs) for discovering new materials. While LLMs have shown remarkable success in various domains, their application to materials science remains underexplored. A fundamental challenge is the lack of understanding of how to best utilize text-based representations for materials modeling. This challenge is further compounded by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and limitations of these text representations in capturing the complexity of material systems. To address this gap, we propose MatText, a suite of benchmarking tools and datasets designed to systematically evaluate the performance of language models in modeling materials. MatText encompasses nine distinct text-based representations for material systems, including several novel representations. Each representation incorporates unique inductive biases that capture relevant information and integrate prior physical knowledge about materials. Additionally, MatText provides essential tools for training and benchmarking the performance of language models in the context of materials science. These tools include standardized dataset splits for each representation, probes for evaluating sensitivity to geometric factors, and tools for seamlessly converting crystal structures into text. Using MatText, we conduct an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models in modeling materials. Our findings reveal that current language models consistently struggle to capture the geometric information crucial for materials modeling across all representations. Instead, these models tend to leverage local information, which is emphasized in some of our novel representations. Our analysis underscores MatText's ability to reveal shortcomings of text-based methods for materials design.</description>

Abstract: The presence and distribution of water on the Moon are fundamental to our understanding of the Earth-Moon system. Despite extensive research and remote detection, the origin and chemical form of lunar water (H2O) have remained elusive. In this study, we present the discovery of a hydrated mineral, (NH4)MgCl3*6H2O, in lunar soil samples returned by the Chang'e-5 mission, containing approximately 41 wt% H2O. The mineral's structure and composition closely resemble novograblenovite, a terrestrial fumarole mineral formed through the reaction of hot basalt with water-rich volcanic gases, and carnallite, an earth evaporite mineral. We rule out terrestrial contamination or rocket exhaust as the origin of this hydrate, based on its chemical and isotopic compositions and formation conditions. The presence of ammonium indicates a more complex lunar degassing history and highlights its potential as a resource for lunar habitation. Our findings also suggest that water molecules can persist in sunlit areas of the Moon as hydrated salt, providing crucial constraints to the fugacity of water and ammonia vapor in lunar volcanic gases.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polyalkylfluorene Conjugated Polymers: Insights from Neutron Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822</link>

Abstract: The dynamics of the conjugated polymers poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) and poly(9,9-didodecylfluorene) (PF12), differing by the length of their side chains, is investigated in the amorphous phase using the quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) technique. The measurements are synergistically underpinned by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The probe is focused on the picosecond time scale, where the structural dynamics of both PF8 and PF12 would mainly be dominated by motions of their side chains. The measurements highlighted temperature-induced dynamics, reflected in the broadening of the QENS spectra upon heating. The MD simulations reproduced well the observations; hence validating the MD force fields, the adopted amorphous model structures, and the numerical procedure. As the QENS spectra are dominated by the signal from the hydrogens on the backbones and side chains of PF8 and PF12, extensive analysis of the MD simulations allowed: (i) tagging these hydrogens, (ii) estimating their contributions to the self-part of the van Hove functions and hence to the QENS spectra, and (iii) determining the activation energies of the different motions involving the tagged hydrogens. PF12 is found to exhibit QENS spectra broader than those of PF8, indicating a more pronounced motion of the didodecyl chains of PF12 as compared to dioctyl chains of PF8. This is in agreement with the outcome of our MD analysis: (i) confirming a lower glass transition temperature of PF12 compared to PF8, (ii) showing PF12 having a lower density than PF8, and (iii) highlighting lower activation energies of the motions of PF12 in comparison with PF8. This study helped to gain insights into the temperature-induced side-chain dynamics of the PF8 and PF12 conjugated polymers, influencing their stability, which could potentially impact the performance of the associated optoelectronic active layer.</description>

      <title>Even-integer Quantum Hall Effect in an Oxide Caused by Hidden Rashba Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of high magnetic field, quantum Hall systems usually host both even- and odd-integer quantized states because of lifted band degeneracies. Selective control of these quantized states is challenging but essential to understand the exotic ground states and manipulate the spin textures. Here, we study the quantum Hall effect in Bi2O2Se thin films. In magnetic fields as high as 50 T, we observe only even-integer quantum Hall states, but no sign of odd-integer states. However, when reducing the thickness of the epitaxial Bi2O2Se film to one unit cell, we observe both odd- and even-integer states in this Janus (asymmetric) film grown on SrTiO3. By means of a Rashba bilayer model based on ab initio band structures of Bi2O2Se thin films, we can ascribe the absence of odd-integer states in thicker films to the hidden Rasbha effect, where the local inversion symmetry breaking in two sectors of the [Bi2O2]2+ layer yields opposite Rashba spin polarizations, which compensate with each other. In the one unit cell Bi2O2Se film grown on SrTiO3, the asymmetry introduced by top surface and bottom interface induces a net polar field. The resulting global Rashba effect lifts the band degeneracies present in the symmetric case of thicker films.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Correlation Augmented Self-Consistent Field Theory and Its Application to Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of two formulas of orbital magnetic susceptibility for tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mez-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>
