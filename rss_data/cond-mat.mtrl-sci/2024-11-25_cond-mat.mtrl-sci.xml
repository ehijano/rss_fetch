      <title>Probing the fluctuating magnetic field of Fe-triazole spin-crossover thin-layers with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ spin-crossover (SCO) complexes are materials that change their magnetic properties upon temperature variation, exhibiting a thermal hysteresis. Particularly interesting for magnetic-memory applications are thin layers of SCO complexes, where practical magnetic probing techniques are required. While conventional magnetometry on SCO complexes employs cryogenic temperatures, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are quantum magnetometers that can operate at room temperature with high spatial resolution and magnetic-field sensitivity. In this work, we apply thin layers of Fe-triazole SCO complexes directly onto a single-crystal diamond with shallow NV centers working as magnetic sensors and probe the fluctuating magnetic field. Using temperature-dependent NV-center $T_1$ measurements and a widefield technique, we find that the complexes are paramagnetic in the investigated temperature range from 20 {\deg}C to 80 {\deg}C. We quantitatively describe the $T_1$ time by a model considering the fluctuating magnetic field of the Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ ions. We see signatures of a local change of spin state in the $T_1$ relaxometry data, but structural changes in the SCO material dominate the local magnetic environment of the NV centers. Moreover, we conduct a Hahn echo to measure the $T_2$ time, which contrasts the findings of the $T_1$ times for the SCO complexes. We attribute this to different NV detection sensitivities towards Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ and Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$ of the protocols. Our results on the magnetic properties of SCO materials highlight the capabilities of the NV center as a susceptible sensor for fluctuating magnetic fields. At the same time, a spin switching of the complexes cannot be observed due to the systematic challenges when working on nanometer distances to the SCO thin layers.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical multiscale fracture modeling of carbon-nitride nanosheet reinforced composites by combining cohesive phase-field and molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fracture mechanisms in composite materials across scales, from nano- to micro-scales, is essential for an in-depth understanding of the reinforcement mechanisms and designing the next generation of lightweight, high-strength composites. However, conventional methods struggle to model the complex fracture behavior of nanocomposites, particularly at the fiber-matrix interface. The phase-field regularized cohesive fracture model has proven to be effective in simulating crack initiation, branching, and propagation; however, capturing the cohesive fracture strength at smaller scales remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel approach that combines an energy-based star-convex decomposition cohesive phase-field fracture model with molecular dynamics simulations to explore the thickness dependency of nanocomposite mechanical properties. The proposed framework enables hierarchical modeling of carbon-nitride nanosheet-reinforced composites' mechanical and fracture behaviors. The developed model could elucidate complex fracture processes across different scales and highlight critical scaling effects. This methodology provides an efficient solution for uncovering hierarchical fracture mechanisms in reinforced nanocomposites, offering valuable insights into their fracture behavior and strengthening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper by Hui et al. (Ref. [1], Sci. Adv. 10, eadp5805 (2024)) claims the demonstration of 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction' with laser-gated electron pulses. In this comment, we point out a series of physical and technical inconsistencies of the experiment and results. Beyond failing to show any microscopy, the reported concept does not produce properly gated electrons. Furthermore, the noise and signal levels of the presented data are statistically and quantitatively incompatible with the work's interpretation and attosecond dynamics in graphite. These inconsistencies render the claims and conclusions of Ref. [1] unsubstantiated and suggest that the data primarily show an interferometric artifact.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Insights into the Site Occupancy and Stability of Ta-Fe-Al C14 Laves Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the site occupancy preferences of Al in Ta(Fe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_2$ Laves phases using first-principles calculations, with Al concentrations ranging from 0 at.\% to 50 at.\%. Al atoms exhibit a strong preference for occupying the $2a$ Wyckoff sites, with higher concentrations leading to more stable configurations when these sites are fully occupied. Magnetic configurations were explored, revealing that anti-ferromagnetic ordering is the most favorable at ground states. A phase diagram based on the chemical potential of Al was constructed to map phase stability, where Ta$_4$Fe$_6$Al$_2$ and Ta$_4$Fe$_2$Al$_6$ exhibit the largest stability ranges. The correlation between lattice distortions and phase stability was examined, demonstrating that symmetric Al distributions contribute to greater stability. These findings offer insight into the structural motifs expected in the Ta-Fe-Al system, providing a foundation for future investigations of structure-property correlations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential for modeling uranium mononitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising accident tolerant fuel due to its high fissile density and high thermal conductivity. In this study, we developed the first machine learning interatomic potentials for reliable atomic-scale modeling of UN at finite temperatures. We constructed a training set using density functional theory (DFT) calculations that was enriched through an active learning procedure and two neural network potentials were generated. We found that both potentials can reproduce some thermophysical properties of interest such as temperature dependent heat capacity. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT values demonstrating that our potentials can be used for a description of defects in UN.</description>

      <title>Mode-selective Raman imaging of metal-organic frameworks reveals surface heterogeneities of single HKUST-1 crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials with high surface-to-volume ratio that have potential applications as gas sorbents. Sample quality is, however, often compromised and it is unclear how defects and surface contaminants affect the spectral properties of single MOF crystals. Raman micro-spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing MOFs, yet spatial spectral heterogeneity distributions of single MOF crystals have not been reported so far. In this work, we use Raman micro-spectroscopy to characterize spatially isolated, single crystals of the MOF species HKUST-1. In a first step, we validate HKUST-1's Raman spectrum based on DFT simulations and we identify a previously unreported vibrational feature. In a second step, we acquire diffraction-limited, mode-selective Raman images of a single HKUST-1 crystals that reveal how the spectral variations are distributed across the crystal surface. In a third step, we statistically analyze the measured spectral peak positions and line widths for quantifying the variability occurring within the same crystal as well as between different crystals taken from the same batch. Finally, we explore how multivariate data analysis can aid feature identification in Raman images of single MOF crystals. For enabling validation and reuse, we have made the spectroscopic data and simulation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Momentum-Space and Real-Space Topological States in Metallic Strontium Ruthenate Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrRuO3, a 4d transition metal oxide, has gained significant interest due to its topological states in both momentum space (Weyl points) and real space (skyrmions). However, probing topological states in ultrathin SrRuO3 faces challenges such as the metal-insulator transition and questioned existence of skyrmions due to possible superposition of opposite anomalous Hall effect (AHE) signals. To address these issues, we investigate ultrathin SrRuO3/SrIrO3 heterostructures and their AHE and topological Hall effect (THE). Our results reveal metallized ultrathin SrRuO3 down to the monolayer limit with an AHE signal. ARPES measurements confirm the metallic and topological band structure of ultrathin SrRuO3. Furthermore, the AHE sign remains negative over a wide thickness range, where THE is still observed. This observation excludes the two-channel explanation of THE and provides evidence for the existence of skyrmions in ultrathin SrRuO3.</description>

      <title>Magnetic resonance frequency of two-sublattice ferrimagnet with magnetic compensation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic materials with a compensation temperature have recently attracted interest because of their unique combination of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties. However, their magnetization dynamics near the compensation temperature are complex and cannot be fully explained by conventional ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) or exchange resonance modes. Therefore, practical models are necessary to capture these dynamics accurately. In this study, we derived the analytical solutions for the magnetic resonance frequencies of compensated ferrimagnets over all temperature ranges, considering both the in-plane and out-of-plane orientations of the magnetization. Our solutions successfully reproduce the experimental data obtained from time-resolved magneto-optical Faraday rotation and Brillouin light scattering measurements for the in-plane and out-of-plane cases, respectively. This reproduction is achieved by incorporating the exchange stiffness and temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy into the free energy density. Additionally, at temperatures sufficiently far from the compensation temperature, our analytical solutions converge with the conventional FMR and exchange resonance models.</description>

      <title>Crack-free Sc$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N(000$\bar{1}$) layers grown on Si(111) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synthesis of 340-nm-thick Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N layers with $0 \leq x \leq 0.35$ on AlN-buffered Si(111) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We employ an AlN nucleation layer under conditions giving rise to single-domain N-polar [(000$\bar{1}$)-oriented] layers, as demonstrated by the ($3 \times 3$) pattern observed in reflection high-energy electron diffraction and confirmed by KOH etching. The subsequent growth of pure wurtzite Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N layers with $x \leq 0.1$ is feasible at temperatures $\leq$ 740{\deg}C. However, layers with $x \geq 0.2$ grown at 740{\deg}C develop cracks due the high thermal mismatch between Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N and Si. Lowering the growth temperature to 500{\deg}C not only prevents cracking but also improves the crystallinity of the layers. For Sc$_{0.3}$Al$_{0.7}$N layers grown at 500{\deg}C, additional x-ray reflections due to intermetallic AlSc and Al$_3$Sc inclusions are observed. The formation of these compounds can be inhibited by lowering the temperature further to 300{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Properties of Composites Based on h-BN and c-BN in Function of Temperature: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations and the ReaxFF force field, we studied a composite based on cubic (c-BN) and hexagonal (h-BN) boron nitride subjected to different temperatures to verify the possibility of a c-BN to h-BN phase transition. Our results demonstrate that the surface termination of c-BN (whether B- or N-terminated) is a crucial factor in the phase transition. The B-terminated c-BN surface presents a lower potential energy than the N-terminated one. However, compared to the potential energy of h-BN, the B- (N-) terminated c-BN surface has a lower (higher) potential energy than h-BN. As the temperature increases, the potential energy of the B-terminated c-BN surface gradually approaches that of h-BN, leading to the beginning of detachment into an h-BN layer around 700 K. With further temperature increase, free h-BN layers can form, which will modify the properties of the composite.</description>

      <title>VO$_2$ films grown on TiO$_2$ sub-layer: influence of thickness on structural, electrical and optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO$_2$-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO$_2$ properties in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO$_2$ films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO$_2$ layer thickness in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$ composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO$_2$ lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO$_2$ layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO$_2$ thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO$_2$ lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO$_2$ layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO$_2$ films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO$_2$ films revealed that VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO$_2$ film to be as low as 800 ns.</description>

      <title>Mode-coupling formulation of heat transport in anharmonic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent phonons are a generalization of interatomic force constants varying in T, which as found widespread use in computing the thermal transport of materials. A formal justification for using this combination to access thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals, beyond the harmonic approximation and perturbation theory, is still lacking. In this work, we derive a theory of heat transport of anharmonic crystals, using the mode-coupling theory of anharmonic lattice dynamics. Starting from the Green-Kubo formula, we develop the thermal conductivity tensor based on the system's dynamical susceptibility, or spectral function. Our results account for both the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions of the heat current, with and without collective effects. We implement our theory in the TDEP package, and have notably introduced a Monte Carlo scheme to compute phonon scattering due to third- and fourth-order interactions, achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost which enables full convergence of such calculations for the first time. We apply our methodology to systems with varying regimes of anharmonicity and thermal conductivity to demonstrate its universality. These applications highlight the importance of the phonon renormalizations and their interactions beyond the harmonic order. Overall, our work advances the understanding of thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals and provides a theoretically robust framework for predicting heat transport in complex materials.</description>

To achieve this theoretically, we vary the concentration of Ta from 0 - 12.5% in SrTi1-xTaxO3 system by substitutional doping and report its effect on the resulting structural, chemical, electronic, chemical, and optical properties. Additionally, we perform band unfolding to shed light on the true nature of optical transitions due to Ta doping. We verify these results experimentally by fabricating epitaxial SrTi1-xTaxO3 thin films ( x = 0 - 5%) by pulsed laser deposition and obtain the optical dielectric properties of the system with the help of spectroscopic ellipsometry. By combining theoretical and experimental studies, we provide evidence that the band gap of STO increases due to Ta doping while also enhancing its electronic properties. The findings of our study offer an extensive understanding of the intricacies associated with elemental doping in perovskite oxides and propose strategies for addressing obstacles associated with TCOs.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Spin-Spin Interaction Mediated by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and chirality are two fundamental properties known to give rise to various intriguing phenomena. However, the interplay between these properties has been rarely explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an off-diagonal non-Hermitian spin-spin interaction mediated by chiral phonons. This interaction arises from the spin-selectivity due to the locking between phonon momentum and angular momentum in chiral materials. The resulting non-Hermitian interaction mediated by the vacuum field of chiral phonons can reach the kHz range for electron spins and can be further enhanced by externally driven mechanical waves, potentially leading to observable effects in the quantum regime. Moreover, the long-range nature of phonon-mediated interactions enables the realization of the long-desired non-Hermitian interaction among multiple spins. The effect proposed in this work may have wide-ranging applications in cascaded quantum systems, non-Hermitian many-body physics, and non-Hermitian cooling.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Ternary Germanite TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ with a C40 chiral structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new family of chiral intermetallic superconductors TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$. The mother compound TaGe$_2$ has a C40-type chiral hexagonal crystal structure with a pair of enantiomorphic space groups of $P6{_2}22$ and $P6{_4}22$. By substituting Ge with Al, TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ polycrystals with the C40 structure were synthesized with Al substitution $x$ from 0 to 0.8. Magnetic susceptibility, magnetization curves and electrical resistivity revealed that TaAl$_{x}$Ge$_{2-x}$ with $x$ of 0.2 to 0.4 was a type-II superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of 2.0 to 2.2 K. The superconductivity disappeared or was largely suppressed at $x$ less than 0.2 and more than 0.4, although all the measurements were performed at temperatures above 1.8 K. An emergence of superconductivity is discussed in terms of the lattice constants changes with the Al substitution.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface reconstruction in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ on LaAlO$_3$(001) and SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>

Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology resembling the superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure and epitaxial strain regarding the crystal geometry and Ni $3d$ orbital occupation, and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under tensile strain as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they are simply MD trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are physically indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems are suspensions of oriented, actively-moving components. Unlike in passive suspensions, the interplay between orientational order, active flows, and interactions with boundaries gives rise to fascinating new phenomena in such active suspensions. Here, we examine the paradigmatic example of a surface-attached drop of an active suspension (an "active drop"), which has so far only been studied in the idealized limit of thin drops. We find that such surface-attached active drops can exhibit a wide array of stable steady-state shapes and internal flows that are far richer than those documented previously, depending on boundary conditions and the strength of active stresses. Our analysis uncovers quantitative principles to predict and even rationally control the conditions under which these different states arise -- yielding design principles for next-generation active materials.</description>

      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics in two-dimensional semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic and thermal transport properties in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been extensively investigated due to their potential to miniaturize transistors. Microscopically, electron-phonon interactions are considered the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism for electrons that limits carrier mobility beyond cryogenic temperatures. However, when electrons and phonons are considered as a single system, electron-phonon interactions conserve the total momentum and energy, leading to the possibility of low-dissipation transport. In this work, we systematically investigate the momentum circulation between electrons and phonons and its impact on carrier transport properties in 2D semiconductors given their strong electron-phonon interactions. We find that, when momentum circulation is taken into account, the total momentum in the coupled electron-phonon system is weakly dissipated, leading to a coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamic transport regime, in which electrons and phonons exhibit a joint drift motion rather than separate diffusive behaviors. In this new transport regime, charge transport properties are significantly enhanced. Contrary to previous belief, our results demonstrate that low-dissipation charge transport can occur despite strong electron-phonon interactions when there is effective momentum circulation between electrons and phonons mediated by the strong interactions. Our work advances fundamental understandings of carrier transport in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Constant-Potential Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal Potential-Regulated Cu Cluster Formation on MoS$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical processes play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion systems, yet their computational modeling remains a significant challenge. Accurately incorporating the effects of electric potential has been a central focus in theoretical electrochemistry. Although constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics (CP-AIMD) has provided valuable insights, it is limited by its substantial computational demands. Here, we introduce the Explicit Electric Potential Machine Learning Force Field (EEP-MLFF) model. Our model integrates the electric potential as an explicit input parameter along with the atom-centered descriptors in the atomic neural network. This approach enables the evaluation of nuclear forces under arbitrary electric potentials, thus facilitating molecular dynamics simulations at a specific potential. By applying the proposed machine learning method to the Cu/1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_{2}$ system, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the potential-modulated Cu atom migration and aggregation lead to the formation of small steric Cu clusters (Single Clusters, SCs) at potentials below -0.1 V. The morphological transformations of adsorbed Cu atoms are elucidated through electronic structure analyses, which demonstrates that both Cu-S and Cu-Cu bonding can be effectively tuned by the applied electric potential. Our findings present an opportunity for the convenient manufacture of single metal cluster catalysts through potential modulation. Moreover, this theoretical framework facilitates the exploration of potential-regulated processes and helps investigate the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently identified class of magnetic materials, possess a spin-split Fermi surface that results in the so-called spin splitter effect, enabling the generation of a spin current transverse to the injection direction and whose polarization lies along the N\'eel vector. In this study, we investigate how magnons interact with electrons in an altermagnetic metal. We find that while the electron-magnon interaction does not perturb the magnon dispersion, a charge current flowing in the material can induce a transverse magnon spin current, analogous to the electronic spin splitter effect. This spin current possesses both electronic and magnonic characteristics, i.e., a chemical potential dependence and a strong temperature dependence. This effect realizes the efficient generation of spin currents via magnons without depending on the material's spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Analysis of Surface Modifications on Silanized Glass: Wettability Alteration and Long-Term Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the effect of wettability on multiphase flow in porous media, hydrophilic glass surfaces are typically modified through a silanization process. This study examines the nanoscale chemical and structural modifications of glass bead surfaces treated with Surfasil, using inverse gas chromatography and atomic force microscopy. The results show that silanization reduces both specific and dispersive components of surface energy, indicating fewer polar groups and lower total energy, leading to decreased hydrophilicity compared to untreated glass beads. BET surface area measurements and AFM images reveal that the surface becomes progressively smoother with increased silanization.
  Subsequently, this study assessed the stability and extent of surface modifications in silanized samples caused by adsorbed water during storage, using untreated glass beads as a reference. Untreated samples exhibit increases in surface roughness and polar groups, leading to marginal increase in surface energy and hydrophilicity. In contrast, the silanized samples show resistance to water adsorption, with only minor alterations in surface energy and structure, likely occurring in areas where the silanization coating was incomplete. The results suggest that humidity control is crucial during extended storage, as prolonged moisture exposure could still lead to surface modifications, even in silanized samples, potentially affecting wettability consistency in repeated experiments.</description>

      <title>An additive Mori-Tanaka scheme for elastic-viscoplastic composites based on a modified tangent linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field modeling based on the Eshelby inclusion problem poses some difficulties when the non-linear Maxwell-type constitutive law is used for elasto-viscoplasticity. One difficulty is that this behavior involves different orders of time differentiation, which leads a long-term memory effect. One of the possible solutions to this problem is the additive interaction law. Generally, mean field models solely use the mean values of stress and strain fields per phase, while variational approaches consider the second moments of stresses and strains. It is seen that the latter approach improves model predictions allowing to account for stress fluctuation within the phases. However, the complexity of the variational formulations still makes them difficult to apply in the large scale finite element calculations and for non-proportional loadings. Thus, there is a need to include the second moments within homogenization models based on the additive interaction law. In the present study, the incorporation of the second moments of stresses into the formulation of the additive Mori-Tanaka model of two-phase elastic-viscoplastic material is discussed. A modified tangent linearization of the viscoplastic law is proposed, while the Hill-Mandel's lemma is used to track the evolution of second moments of stresses. To study the model performance and efficiency, the results are compared to the full-field numerical calculations and predictions of other models available in the literature. Very good performance of the modified tangent linearization is demonstrated from these benchmarks for both monotonic and non monotonic loading responses.</description>

Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Parametric study of filament and gap models of resistive switching in TaO$_x$-based devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite element model consisting of a conducting filament with or without a gap was used to reproduce behavior of TaO$_x$-based resistive switching devices. The specific goal was to explore the range of possible filament parameters such a filament diameter, composition, gap width, and composition to reproduce the conductance and shape of I-V while keeping the maximum temperature within acceptable range allowing for ion motion and preventing melting. The model solving heat and charge transport produced a good agreement with experimental data for the oxygen content in the filament below TaO$_{1.3}$, the filament diameter range between 6 and 22 nm, and the gap oxygen content between TaO$_{1.7}$ and TaO$_{1.85}$. Gap width was not limited on either low or high sides by the criteria considered in this report. The obtained filament composition corresponds to oxygen deficiency an order of magnitude higher than one estimated by other modelling efforts. This was in a large part due to use of recent experimental values of conductivity as a function of composition and temperature. Our modelling results imply that a large fraction of atoms leaves and/or accumulates within the filament to produce large relative concentration change. This, in turn, necessitates inclusion of strain energy in the filament formation modelling. In addition, the results reproduce non-linear I-V without the necessity of assuming the Poole-Frenkel type of electrical conduction or presence of a barrier at the oxide/metal interface.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Frenkel-Wannier excitons facilitate ultrafast energy transfer at a 2D-organic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and organic semiconductors (OSCs) have emerged as promising material platforms for next-generation optoelectronic devices. The combination of both is predicted to yield emergent properties while retaining the advantages of their individual components. In OSCs the optoelectronic response is typically dominated by localized Frenkel-type excitons, whereas TMDs host delocalized Wannier-type excitons. However, much less is known about the spatial and electronic characteristics of excitons at hybrid TMD/OSC interfaces, which ultimately determine the possible energy and charge transfer mechanisms across the 2D-organic interface. Here, we use ultrafast momentum microscopy and many-body perturbation theory to elucidate a hybrid exciton at an TMD/OSC interface that forms via the ultrafast resonant F\"orster energy transfer process. We show that this hybrid exciton has both Frenkel- and Wannier-type contributions: Concomitant intra- and interlayer electron-hole transitions within the OSC layer and across the TMD/OSC interface, respectively, give rise to an exciton wavefunction with mixed Frenkel-Wannier character. By combining theory and experiment, our work provides previously inaccessible insights into the nature of hybrid excitons at TMD/OSC interfaces. It thus paves the way to a fundamental understanding of charge and energy transfer processes across 2D-organic heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IF-DMI) leads to non-collinear spin configurations within the magnetic layers of multilayer heterostructures, while its interlayer counterpart (IL-DMI) minimizes chiral states between the layers. Here, we demonstrate that the symmetries of these interactions are very different, even though both arise from pairwise exchange interactions between magnetic sites mediated by nonmagnetic atoms. By deriving new boundary conditions for the exchange operator and solving the associated boundary value problem, we show that, unlike IF-DMI, which does not contribute to the FMR frequencies, IL-DMI alters the frequencies of the fundamental FMR modes and can be separated from other contributions in an FMR experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermal expansion in rare-earth cage systems: examples from the RB6 and RPt4Ge12 series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some intermetallic compounds, the crystallographic structure allows for an unusual latitude of movement of lanthanide ions inside so-called cages. Examples of such magnetic cage systems include the rare-earth hexaborides RB6 and filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 series. In both instances, the rare-earth site, at the center of the cage, is of high symmetry, which may preserve some degree of orbital degeneracy. A deviation from the cage center lifts this degeneracy, yielding an interplay between the rare-earth movement and the system properties in the paramagnetic range. In particular, the low temperature thermal expansion should reflect this cage-specific crystal field contribution. This study presents an experimental investigation of the thermal expansion in the paramagnetic range of some elements in the aforementioned series. From a simple model for the vibrations in cage systems, a description of the phononic thermal expansion is proposed, within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Accounting for this non-magnetic contributions helps discern the influence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperature.</description>

Abstract: Dislocation engineering has the potential to open new avenues toward the exploration and modification of the properties of quantum materials. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3, STO) and potassium tantalate (KTaO3, KTO) are incipient ferroelectrics that show metallization and superconductivity at extremely low charge carrier concentrations, and have been the subject of resurgent interest. These materials also exhibit remarkable ambient-temperature ductility, and thus represent exceptional platforms for studies of the effects of deformation-induced dislocation structures on electronic properties. Recent work on plastically deformed STO revealed an enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature and the emergence of local ferroelectricity and magnetism near self-organized dislocation walls. Here we present a comprehensive structural analysis of plastically deformed STO and KTO, employing specially designed strain cells, diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering, Raman scattering, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Diffuse scattering and NMR provide insight into the dislocation configurations and densities and their dependence on strain. As in the prior work on STO, Raman scattering reveals evidence for local ferroelectric order near dislocation walls in plastically deformed KTO. Our findings provide valuable information about the self-organized defect structures in both materials, and they position KTO as a second model system with which to explore the associated emergent physics.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional layered materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), possess intrinsic van der Waals gap at the layer interface allowing for remarkable tunability of the optoelectronic features via external intercalation of foreign guests such as atoms, ions, or molecules. Herein, we introduce a high-throughput, data-driven computational framework for the design of novel quantum materials derived from intercalating planar conjugated organic molecules into bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and dioxides. By combining first-principles methods, material informatics, and machine learning, we characterize the energetic and mechanical stability of this new class of materials and identify the fifty (50) most stable hybrid materials from a vast configurational space comprising $\sim 10^5$ materials, employing intercalation energy as the screening criterion.</description>

      <title>Segregation at prior austenite grain boundaries: the competition between boron and hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between boron and hydrogen at grain boundaries has been investigated experimentally and numerically in boron-doped and boron-free martensitic steels using thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) and ab initio calculations. The calculations show that boron and hydrogen are attracted to grain boundaries but boron can repel hydrogen. This behavior has also been observed using TDS measurements, with the disappearance of one peak when boron is incorporated into the microstructure. Additionally, the microstructure of both steels has been studied through electron backscattered diffraction, electron channeling contrast imaging, synchrotron X-ray measurements, and atom probe tomography. While they have a similar grain size, grain boundary distribution, and dislocation densities, a pronounced boron segregation into PAGBs is observed for boron-doped steels. Then, the equilibrium hydrogen concentration in different trapping sites has been evaluated using the Langmuir-McLean approximation. This thermodynamic model shows that the distribution of hydrogen is identical for all traps when the total hydrogen concentration is low for boron-free steel. However, when it increases, traps of the lowest segregation energies (mostly PAGBs) are firstly saturated, which promotes failure initiation at this defect type. This finding partially explains why PAGBs are the weakest microstructure feature when martensitic steels are exposed to hydrogen-containing environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) codes which employ a localized basis offer advantages over those which use plane-wave bases, such as better scaling with system size and better suitability to low-dimensional systems. The trade-off is that care must be taken in order to generate a good localized basis set which is efficient and accurate in a variety of environments. Here we develop and make freely available optimized local basis sets for two common two-dimensional (2D) materials, graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, for the \siesta DFT code. Each basis set is benchmarked against the \abinit plane-wave code, using the same pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals. We find that a significant improvement is obtained by including the $l+2$ polarization orbitals ($4f$) to the basis set, which greatly improves angular flexibility. The optimized basis sets yield much better agreement with plane-wave calculations for key features of the physical system, including total energy, lattice constant and cohesive energy. The optimized basis sets also result in a speedup of the calculations with respect to the non-optimized, native choices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

Abstract: Designing well-defined magnetic nanomaterials is crucial for various applications and it demands a comprehensive understanding of their magnetic properties at the microscopic level. In this study, we investigate the contributions to the total anisotropy of Mn-Co mixed spinel nanoparticles. By employing neutron measurements sensitive to the spatially resolved surface anisotropy with sub-\AA\space resolution, we reveal an additional contribution to the anisotropy constant arising from shape anisotropy and interparticle interactions. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between chemical composition, microstructure, morphology, and surface effects, providing valuable insights for the design of advanced magnetic nanomaterials for AC biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment by magnetic fluid hyperthermia.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>

Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>
