      <title>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter Induced in Optically Driven Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside it. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new non-equilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal step-like structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that red-shifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this step-like potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is red shifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a disordered superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity, we construct the non-equilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Camera: Scaling Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Imaging at the Quantum-Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent boundary supersymmetry in a one dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between bulk properties and boundary conditions in one-dimensional quantum systems, gives rise to many intriguing phenomena. These include the emergence of zero energy modes which are of significant interest to a variety of fields. In this work we investigate the presence of such zero modes in cases where the boundary conditions are dynamical and arise due to the coupling to some quantum degrees of freedom. In particular, we study a one-dimensional spin-singlet superconductor, modeled by the Gross-Neveu field theory, coupled to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic impurities at its boundaries via a spin-exchange interaction. We solve the model exactly for arbitrary values of the bulk and the impurity coupling strengths using nested coordinate Bethe ansatz and show that the system exhibits a rich boundary phase structure. For a range of couplings, the low energy degrees of freedom form irreducible representations of the supersymmetric $spl(2,1)\otimes spl(2,1)$ algebra which become degenerate at a specific point, indicating the emergence of supersymmetry in the low energy boundary degrees of freedom. We show that at the supersymmetric point there exist exact zero energy modes that map one ground state with the other. We express these in terms of the generators of the algebra.</description>

      <title>Possible Unconventional Surface Superconductivity in the Half-Heusler YPtBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an extensive study of the noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler superconductor YPtBi, revealing an unusual relation between bulk superconductivity and the possible appearance of surface superconductivity on the (111) oriented surface, at temperatures up to 3 times the bulk transition temperature. Transport measurements confirmed the low carrier density of the material and its bulk superconducting transition, which was also observed in ac susceptibility through mutual inductance (MI) measurements. However, a weak signature of superconductivity in the MI measurements appeared much above the bulk transition temperature, which was further observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, pointing to a possible surface superconducting state. Polar Kerr effect measurements suggest that while the bulk superconductor may exhibit an unusual nodal superconducting state, only the surface state breaks time reversal symmetry. Complementary tunneling measurements on LuPtBi are used to establish the observations on YPtBi, while density-functional theory calculations may shed light on the origin of this unusual surface state.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase interference effect in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the phases of the superconducting order parameter is pivotal for unraveling the pairing symmetry of superconducting electrons. Conventional methods for probing these phases have focused on macroscopic interference effects, such as the Josephson effect. However, at the microscopic level, phase interference effects within momentum space have remained elusive due to the inherent difficulty of extracting phase information from individual momentum points. By introducing the hybridization effect between a primary band and its replica bands arising from density wave orders or other interactions, we uncover a novel superconducting phase interference effect at the intersection points on the Fermi surfaces of these bands. This effect elucidates the remarkable anomalies recently observed in the single-particle spectral function through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212) superconductors. It can also emerge in twisted junctions of superconductors with coherent tunneling, offering an alternative framework for probing the relative superconducting phase through twisted superstructures.</description>

      <title>Kramers nodal lines in intercalated TaS$_2$ superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines (KNLs), anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal KNLs well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Local symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with over $50\,\mathrm{dB}$ of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency ($200\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. $80\,\mathrm{MHz}$) at roughly one seventh the cost.</description>
