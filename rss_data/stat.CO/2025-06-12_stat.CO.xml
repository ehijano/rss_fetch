      <title>Variational inference for steady-state BVARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) makes it possible to incorporate prior information about the long-run mean of the process. This has been shown in many studies to substantially improve forecasting performance, and the model is routinely used for forecasting and macroeconomic policy analysis at central banks and other financial institutions. Steady-steady BVARs are estimated using Gibbs sampling, which is time-consuming for the increasingly popular large-scale BVAR models with many variables. We propose a fast variational inference (VI) algorithm for approximating the parameter posterior and predictive distribution of the steady-state BVAR, as well as log predictive scores for model comparison. We use simulated and real US macroeconomic data to show that VI produces results that are very close to those from Gibbs sampling. The computing time of VI can be orders of magnitude lower than Gibbs sampling, in particular for log predictive scores, and VI is shown to scale much better with the number of time series in the system.</description>

      <title>Parallel computations for Metropolis Markov chains with Picard maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop parallel algorithms for simulating zeroth-order (aka gradient-free) Metropolis Markov chains based on the Picard map. For Random Walk Metropolis Markov chains targeting log-concave distributions $\pi$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, our algorithm generates samples close to $\pi$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ parallel iterations with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ processors, therefore speeding up the convergence of the corresponding sequential implementation by a factor $\sqrt{d}$. Furthermore, a modification of our algorithm generates samples from an approximate measure $ \pi_\epsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parallel iterations and $\mathcal{O}(d)$ processors. We empirically assess the performance of the proposed algorithms in high-dimensional regression problems and an epidemic model where the gradient is unavailable. Our algorithms are straightforward to implement and may constitute a useful tool for practitioners seeking to sample from a prescribed distribution $\pi$ using only point-wise evaluations of $\log\pi$ and parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Integrated Analysis for Electronic Health Records with Structured and Sporadic Missingness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: We propose a novel imputation method tailored for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with structured and sporadic missingness. Such missingness frequently arises in the integration of heterogeneous EHR datasets for downstream clinical applications. By addressing these gaps, our method provides a practical solution for integrated analysis, enhancing data utility and advancing the understanding of population health.
  Materials and Methods: We begin by demonstrating structured and sporadic missing mechanisms in the integrated analysis of EHR data. Following this, we introduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to handle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish theoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the integrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical performance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex missingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by validation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).
  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms existing imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS, Macomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases and provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared to benchmark methods.
  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful method for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and reliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets. The proposed approach holds significant potential for advancing research in population health.</description>

      <title>A new hierarchical distribution on arbitrary sparse precision matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general strategy for defining distributions over the space of sparse symmetric positive definite matrices. Our method utilizes the Cholesky factorization of the precision matrix, imposing sparsity through constraints on its elements while preserving their independence and avoiding the numerical evaluation of normalization constants. In particular, we develop the S-Bartlett as a modified Bartlett decomposition, recovering the standard Wishart as a particular case. By incorporating a Spike-and-Slab prior to model graph sparsity, our approach facilitates Bayesian estimation through a tailored MCMC routine based on a Dual Averaging Hamiltonian Monte Carlo update. This framework extends naturally to the Generalized Linear Model setting, enabling applications to non-Gaussian outcomes via latent Gaussian variables. We test and compare the proposed S-Bartelett prior with the G-Wishart both on simulated and real data. Results highlight that the S-Bartlett prior offers a flexible alternative for estimating sparse precision matrices, with potential applications across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Exploring the generalizability of the optimal 0.234 acceptance rate in random-walk Metropolis and parallel tempering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For random-walk Metropolis (RWM) and parallel tempering (PT) algorithms, an asymptotic acceptance rate of around 0.234 is known to be optimal in certain high-dimensional limits. However, its practical relevance is uncertain due to restrictive derivation conditions. We synthesise previous theoretical advances in extending the 0.234 acceptance rate to more general settings, and demonstrate its applicability with a comprehensive empirical simulation study on examples examining how acceptance rates affect Expected Squared Jumping Distance (ESJD). Our experiments show the optimality of the 0.234 acceptance rate for RWM is surprisingly robust even in lower dimensions across various proposal, multimodal distributions that may not have an i.i.d. product density, and curved Rosenbrock target distributions with nonlinear correlation structure. Parallel tempering experiments also show that the idealized 0.234 spacing of inverse temperatures may be approximately optimal for low dimensions and non i.i.d. product target densities, and that constructing an inverse temperature ladder with spacings given by a swap acceptance of 0.234 is a viable strategy.</description>

      <title>Temperature Optimization for Bayesian Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cold Posterior Effect (CPE) is a phenomenon in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), where tempering the posterior to a cold temperature often improves the predictive performance of the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). Although the term `CPE' suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily emphasizes the predictive performance of the PPD, the latter prioritizes the utility of the posterior under model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature preferences.</description>
