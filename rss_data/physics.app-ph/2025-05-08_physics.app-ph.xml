      <title>Spalled barium titanate single crystal thin films for functional device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a scalable approach for fabricating single-crystal barium titanate (BTO) thin films through spalling from bulk substrates. Conventional thin film growth techniques often face challenges in achieving high-quality single crystal microstructure over large areas, resulting in reduced performance in functional devices. In contrast, spalling - i.e., performing stress-induced exfoliation of bulk single crystals - enables the separation of single crystal thin films with controllable thicknesses ranging from 100 nm to 15 um and lateral dimensions up to several millimeters. Electro-optic characterization of the spalled films yields a Pockels coefficient of r33 = 55 pm/V in multi-domain regions and 160 pm/V in single-domain regions, leading to projections up to 1980 pm/V for r42 under conditions of unclamped excitation. Our results indicate that spalled BTO single-crystal thin films preserve bulk electro-optic properties and exceed the performance of commercially available thin-film lithium niobate, making them suitable for integration in advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Periodic feature characterization in nanostructured surfaces and emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-function relationships is essential to advance the manufacturing of next-gen materials with desired properties and functionalities. Precise and rapid measurement of features like wrinkle size, droplet diameter, and surface roughness is essential to establishing such structure-function relationships. To this end, this work developed feature size and surface morphology characterizations through image analysis in Python and validated them with both synthetic and experimental images. Manual measurements of bio-based surfaces resulted in between 3.3% (N=50, visually simple) and 51.2% error (N=100, visually complex) compared to Python analysis results. This analysis was also used to accurately distinguish multiple feature size populations in a given image (which were missed entirely in manual measurements), and to determine the skewness and kurtosis of biological surfaces in a surface roughness map. This work contributes to a larger goal of developing a robust and computationally cheap platform to analyze complex materials to accelerate structure-function discovery.</description>

      <title>Directional Thermal Emission Across Both Polarizations in Planar Photonic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional and spectral control of thermal emission is essential for applications in energy conversion, imaging, and sensing. Existing planar, lithography-free epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) films only support transverse-magnetic (TM) control of thermal emission via the Berreman mode and cannot address transverse-electric (TE) waves due to the absence of natural optical magnetism over optical and infrared wavelengths Here, we introduce a hyperbolic metamaterial comprising alternating layers of degenerately-doped and intrinsic InAs that exhibits an epsilon-and-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) response, enabling dual-polarized, directionally and spectrally selective thermal emission. We first theoretically demonstrate that a mu-near-zero (MNZ) film on a perfect magnetic conductor supports a magnetic Berreman mode, absorbing TE-polarized radiation in analogy to the conventional Berreman mode supported in TM polarization. Using genetic and gradient-descent optimization, we design a dual-polarized emitter with independently tunable spectral peaks and emission angles. Parameter retrieval via homogenization confirms simultaneous EMNZ points at the target wavelengths and angles. Finally, experimental measurement of a sample fabricated via molecular beam epitaxy exhibits high absorptivity peaks for both polarizations in close agreement with simulations. This work realizes lithography-free, dual-polarized, spectrally and directionally selective emitters, offering a versatile platform for advanced infrared thermal management and device integration.</description>

      <title>Quantum CNOT Gate with Actively Synchronized Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor. We achieve a truth-table fidelity exceeding 85% and demonstrate Bell-inequality violation for all four Bell states. The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Elastic Metamaterials for Zero-Frequency and Zero-Wavenumber Bandgaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create wave-matter space-time metamaterials using optical trapping forces to manipulate mass-spring chains and create zero-frequency and zero-wavenumber band gaps: the bosonic nature of phonons, and hence this elastodynamic setting, traditionally prohibits either zero-frequency or zero-wavenumber band gaps. Here, we generate zero-frequency gaps using optomechanical interactions within a 3D mass-spring chain by applying an optical trapping force to hold or manipulate a mass in a contactless manner independent of its elastodynamic excitations. Through careful modification of the geometrical parameters in the trapped monoatomic mass-spring chain, we demonstrate the existence of a zero-frequency gap generated by the optical forces on the masses. The precise control we have over the system allows us to drive another set of masses and springs out of phase with its traveling wave thereby creating a zero-wavenumber band gap.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Low Frequency Noise in CryoCMOS devices through Statistical Single Defect Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.</description>

      <title>Instantons and Rarefaction Pulses as Pathways to Global Phase Coherence in Gain-Based Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to reliably remove unwanted global phase windings in gain-based optical oscillator networks, thereby ensuring convergence to the true synchronized configuration corresponding to the XY Hamiltonian's global minimum. Focusing on one-dimensional rings and two-dimensional toroidal lattices, we show that two key strategies greatly enhance the probability of reaching the defect-free state. First, operating at a low effective injection rate just above threshold, exploits the amplitude degree of freedom, allowing the system to form transient zero-amplitude holes: instantons in one dimension, or vortex-antivortex rarefaction pulses in two-dimensional space, that enable phase slips. Second, preparing the initial condition with amplitude or phase inhomogeneities can directly seed these amplitude collapses and prevent the system from getting trapped in higher-energy states with nonzero winding. Using the Stuart--Landau and Ginzburg--Landau equations as models for fast-reservoir lasers, we derive analytic and numerical evidence that even relatively minor amplitude dips can trigger global unwinding in 1D. We further demonstrate that the pump's slow annealing favours these amplitude-driven events, leading to improved success in finding the globally coherent ground state. These findings highlight the critical role of amplitude freedom in analogue solvers for XY optimization problems, showing how local amplitude suppression provides a direct route to ejecting topological defects.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Dynamic Stability in Paul Traps: Exploring Rotating Saddles with Liquid Nitrogen Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating saddle potentials provide a compelling visual demonstration of dynamic stability, widely used in undergraduate physics as mechanical analogs to the RF Paul trap. Traditional demonstrations typically rely on rolling ball bearings, whose frictional effects and internal rotation obscure fundamental particle dynamics. We introduce a simple yet significant improvement by employing droplets of liquid nitrogen LN2, which levitate via the Leidenfrost effect, eliminating rolling dynamics and greatly reducing friction. LN2 droplets clearly illustrate the rotating ponderomotive-like force, producing trajectories closely consistent with theoretical predictions. Using experimental data, we compare the stability threshold and particle trajectories of LN2 droplets and traditional ball bearings. LN2 droplets exhibit a sharply defined and visually distinct stability threshold, transitioning abruptly from unstable to stable motion at a critical rotation frequency. In contrast, ball bearings demonstrate a more gradual threshold, accompanied by trajectories complicated by friction-induced deviations. We present detailed measurements of particle lifetimes and trajectories as functions of dimensionless stability parameters for both symmetric and intentionally asymmetric saddles. These improvements significantly enhance visual and conceptual clarity, reduce common misconceptions related to frictional dynamics, and provide natural opportunities for exploring related phenomena such as the Leidenfrost effect. We also offer practical guidance on assembling and implementing this enhanced demonstration for effective classroom and laboratory instruction.</description>

      <title>Impact of Radio Frequency Power on Columnar and Filamentary Modes in Atmospheric Pressure Very Low Frequency Plasma within Pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of radio frequency (RF) power on columnar and filamentary modes of very low frequency (VLF) plasma within pores is investigated in this work. The 12.5 kHz VLF discharge under various RF powers (13.56 MHz) was analyzed using optical photography and current-voltage measurements. Two-dimensional electron densities were derived using optical emission spectroscopy combined with collisional radiation modeling methods. It is found that RF power and very low frequency voltage (VVLF) significantly influence the plasma and its discharge modes within the 200 {\mu}m pore. Under low VVLF conditions, the plasma is more intense within the pore, and the discharge mode is columnar discharge. With increasing RF power, the reciprocal motion of electrons counteracts the local enhancement effect of columnar discharge, the discharge transforms into RF discharge, the pore is completely wrapped by the sheath, and the plasma inside is gradually quenched. Under high VVLF conditions, the electron density within the pore is low and the discharge mode is filamentary discharge. RF introduction reduces plasma intensity within the pores firstly. As RF power increases, more ion trapping in the pore increases the field strength distortion and enhances the plasma intensity inside the pore, this enhancement effects becomes more obvious with increasing RF power. In addition, the above effects were observed for all pore widths from 100 um to 1000 um. These findings provide key insights for controlling plasma in pores and offer new methodologies for plasma technology applications.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of flux instabilities in ramped superconducting magnets with synchronous temperature-modulated Jc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04159v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear multi-field coupling as an intrinsic property of complex physical systems often leads to abrupt and undesired instabilities. For current-ramped high-field Nb3Sn magnets, frequent flux jumps are observed, which easily causes premature quenches and requires prolonged and resource-intensive magnet training process. In this study, we propose a paradigm-shifting methodology framework that achieves complete suppression of thermomagnetic instabilities through synchronized temperature-modulated critical current density (Jc). Through numerical simulations of flux jumps in multifilamentary Nb3Sn wires exposed to a time-varying magnetic field at various temperatures, we construct thermomagnetic stability diagram in the Ha-T plane. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which demonstrates the synchronized ramped-down temperature can indeed fully eliminate flux jumps. We reveal the underlying physical mechanism of enhancing the thermomagnetic stability arises from that synchronized ramped-down temperature can continuously tune both Jc and its slope. Furthermore, we carry out numerical simulations for the thermomagnetic instabilities of current-ramped superconducting magnets through large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm with home-made codes. The flux jump and quench diagram in the Ia-T plane are obtained. It indicates that the ramped-down temperature can completely suppress flux jumps without compromising Jc at high magnetic fields. Importantly, this method does not require modifications to the superconducting microstructures or fabrication process, offering a practical and broadly applicable solution.The findings offer a robust method to stabilize diverse superconducting magnet systems (including 2nd-gen coated tape HTS magnets), and propose a generalizable strategy for controlling instability in nonlinear non-equilibrium physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical systems have been pivotal for energy-efficient computing, performing high-speed, parallel operations in low-loss carriers. While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Room Temperature Exchange Bias through N\'eel Order Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange bias effect plays a crucial role in modern magnetic memory technology. Recently, van der Waals magnetic materials have emerged and shown potential in spintronic devices at atomic scale. Owing to their tunable physical properties and the flexibility in fabrication, the van der Waals heterostructures offer more possibilities for investigating potential mechanisms of the exchange bias effect. However, due to low magnetic ordering temperatures for most van der Waals magnets, to establish exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnet/ferromagnet heterostructures at room temperature is challenging. In this study, we fabricate (Fe$_{0.56}$Co$_{0.44}$)$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$(FCGT)/Fe$_{3}$GaTe$_{2}$(FGaT) heterostructures with magnetic ordering temperatures of each component well above room temperature to achieve a room temperature exchange bias effect. It is found that the sign and magnitude of the exchange bias field can be efficiently controlled by manipulating the N\'eel order of FCGT with magnetic field. The manipulation of N\'eel order shows significant magnetic field dependence. A strong pre-set field induces a switch in the N\'eel order of FCGT, which aligns the interfacial magnetization at the FCGT/FGaT interface, leading to robust exchange bias, as revealed by both transport measurements and macro-spin model calculations. Our findings demonstrate the intrinsic manipulation and switchable of room-temperature exchange bias in all-van der Waals heterostructures and further promote the development of novel two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive-expulsion: toward creating an electron-free volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a demonstration of a prototype approach to clear the laser focal volume of free electrons and disable their atomic and molecular sources. Employing two temporally separated, copropagating pulses, we exploited a pump-probe setup in our experiment. The pump ionized a low-density gas and expelled free and nascent electrons from its focal volume. The probe, traversing the same focal volume, expelled any remaining free and probe-induced nascent electrons. We gauged the effectiveness of the approach by capturing the spatial distribution of ejected electrons with image plates while we varied the relative intensity and time delay between the pump and probe. When we injected the pump 300 fs before the probe, we found the electron spatial distribution significantly altered and the yield suppressed, proving ponderomotive expulsion works. However, the yield was enhanced when we set the temporal spacing between the pump and probe to 150 fs. Simulations show the enhancement is due to Airy rings of the focused pump expelling electrons inward toward the propagation axis. Our results show that the complete removal of focal-volume electrons was inhibited by spatial overlap fluctuations and the stronger probe generating ionization outside the cleared-volume of the pump. We discuss ways to mitigate these impediments and propose alternate two-beam arrangements to achieve more efficient focal-volume clearing.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>
