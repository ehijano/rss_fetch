      <title>Local generation of tilings: the even bicolor Wang tilesets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the techniques developed in our previous article ``Local generation of tilings'', in which we introduced two definitions capturing the intuitive idea that some subshifts admit a procedure that can generate any tiling and working in a local way. We classify all the Wang tilesets with two colors in which each tile has an even number of each color.</description>

      <title>Generic reversible complex polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the generic complex 1-dimensional polynomial vector fields of the form $iP(z)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, where $P$ is a polynomial with real coefficients, under topological orbital equivalence preserving the separatrices of the pole at infinity. The number of generic strata is determined, and a complete parametrization of the strata is given in terms of a modulus formed by a combinatorial part and an analytic part. The bifurcation diagram is described for degrees 3 and 4. A realization theorem is proved for any generic modulus.</description>

      <title>Orbits in Teichm\"uller dynamics admits a critical exponent gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McMullen '03 constructs a collection of orbits $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R}).x$ in $\mathcal{H}(1,1)$ with infinitely generated stabilizers $\mathrm{stab}_{\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})}(x)$. We prove a gap in the set of critical exponents of stabilizers of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$-orbits in $\mathcal{H}_g$: for every $x\in \mathcal{H}_g$, either $\mathrm{stab}_{\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})}(x)$ is a lattice, or we have a uniform bound on the critical exponent $\delta(\mathrm{stab}_{\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})}(x)) \le 1-\varepsilon_g$.</description>

      <title>Probability of constructing prediction model for observable of a dynamical process via time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One fundamental problem in studying dynamical process is whether it is possible and how to construct prediction model for an unknown system via sampled time series, especially in the modern big data era. The research in this area is beneficial to experimentalists in physics, chemistry, especially, in biological science, where it is hard to construct a prediction models by first principles. Therefore constructing prediction model for the observable of a complex system is of great practical significance in various areas of science and engineering. In the present paper, we show in terms of Lebesgue measure that, at least in the linear case, one can almost surely construct by linear algebra approach the prediction model about observable of unknown systems only via observed time series in the settings of discrete time and continuous time linear systems, even in the situation that one has no information about the underlying dynamical process and output function that generates the observed time series. Interestingly, we can obtain the characteristic polynomial of the unknown matrices for both of discrete time and continuous time linear systems with probability 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $f$ is a smooth special absolutely partial hyperbolic endomorphism on the 2-torus which is homotopic to an expanding linear endomorphism $A$ with irrational real eigenvalues $|\lambda^u_A|&gt;|\lambda^c_A|&gt;1$. If $f$ expands area, and its center bundle is $C^1$, then the semi-conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $A$ is a smooth conjugacy.</description>

      <title>The multilinear circle method and a question of Bergelson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]
  as $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theory for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics for individual payoff game-theoretic models of vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination is widely recognised as one of the most effective forms of public health interventions. Individuals decisions regarding vaccination creates a complex social dilemma between individual and collective interests, where each person's decision affects the overall public health outcome. In this paper, we study the adaptive dynamics for the evolutionary dynamics of strategies in a fundamental game-theoretic model of vaticination. We show the existence of an (Nash) equilibrium and analyse the stability and bifurcations when varying the relevant parameters. We also demonstrate our analytical results by several concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of direct reciprocity with N rounds of memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of direct reciprocity explores how individuals cooperate when they interact repeatedly. In repeated interactions, individuals can condition their behaviour on what happened earlier. One prominent example of a conditional strategy is Tit-for-Tat, which prescribes to cooperate if and only if the co-player did so in the previous round. The evolutionary dynamics among such memory-1 strategies have been explored in quite some detail. However, obtaining analytical results on the dynamics of higher memory strategies becomes increasingly difficult, due to the rapidly growing size of the strategy space. Here, we derive such results for the adaptive dynamics in the donation game. In particular, we prove that for every orbit forward in time, there is an associated orbit backward in time that also solves the differential equation. Moreover, we analyse the dynamics by separating payoffs into a symmetric and an anti-symmetric part and demonstrate some properties of the anti-symmetric part. These results highlight some interesting symmetries that arise when interchanging player one with player two, and cooperation with defection.</description>

      <title>A note on a recent attempt to solve the second part of Hilbert's 16th Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given natural number $n$, the second part of Hilbert's 16th Problem asks whether there exists a finite upper bound for the maximum number of limit cycles that planar polynomial vector fields of degree $n$ can have. This maximum number of limit cycle, denoted by $H(n)$, is called the $n$th Hilbert number. It is well-established that $H(n)$ grows asymptotically as fast as $n^2 \log n$. A direct consequence of this growth estimation is that $H(n)$ cannot be bounded from above by any quadratic polynomial function of $n$. Recently, the authors of the paper [Exploring limit cycles of differential equations through information geometry unveils the solution to Hilbert's 16th problem. Entropy, 26(9), 2024] affirmed to have solved the second part of Hilbert's 16th Problem by claiming that $H(n) = 2(n - 1)(4(n - 1) - 2)$. Since this expression is quadratic in $n$, it contradicts the established asymptotic behavior and, therefore, cannot hold. In this note, we further explore this issue by discussing some counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Hitting statistics for $\phi$-mixing dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hitting rate and escape rate are two examples of recurrence laws for a dynamical system, and they are connected by a general limit. We show that for systems with $\phi$-mixing measure, this general limit is equal to one for non-periodic points and less than one for periodic points, which is given by an explicit formula. One of the applications of this result is to Riemannian manifold with a $C^{1+\zeta}$-map such as hyperbolic maps and expanding maps, and it can be applied to any system with a suitable Young tower.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the deep linear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of training dynamics in the Deep Linear Network (DLN) from the perspective of the geometric theory of dynamical systems. Rigorous results by several authors are unified into a thermodynamic framework for deep learning.
  The analysis begins with a characterization of the invariant manifolds and Riemannian geometry in the DLN. This is followed by exact formulas for a Boltzmann entropy, as well as stochastic gradient descent of free energy using a Riemannian Langevin Equation. Several links between the DLN and other areas of mathematics are discussed, along with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Integrable sub-Riemannian geodesic flows on the special orthogonal group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to define a sub-Riemannian metric is as the limit of a Riemannian metric. Consider a Riemannian structure depending on a parameter $s$ such that its limit defines a sub-Riemannian metric when $s \to \infty$, assuming that the Riemannian geodesic flow is integrable for all $s$. An interesting question is: Can we determine the integrability of the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow as the limit of the integrals of motion of the Riemannian geodesic flow? The paper's main contribution is to provide a positive answer to this question in the special orthogonal group. Theorem 1.1 states that the Riemannian geodesic flow is Liuville integrable: The Manakov integrals' limit suggests the existence of a Lax pair formulation of the Riemannian geodesic equations, and the proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on this Lax pair.</description>

      <title>How to quantify interaction strengths? A critical rethinking of the interaction Jacobian and evaluation methods for non-parametric inference in time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying interaction strengths between state variables in dynamical systems is essential for understanding ecological networks. Within the empirical dynamic modeling approach, multivariate S-map infers the interaction Jacobian from time series data without assuming specific dynamical models. This approach enables the non-parametric statistical inference of interspecific interactions through state space reconstruction. However, deviations in the biological interpretation and numerical implementation of the interaction Jacobian from its mathematical definition pose challenges. We mathematically reintroduce the interaction Jacobian using differential quotients, uncovering two problems: (1) the mismatch between the interaction Jacobian and its biological meaning complicates comparisons between interspecific and intraspecific interactions; (2) the interaction Jacobian is not fully implemented in the parametric Jacobian numerically derived from given parametric models, especially using ordinary differential equations. As a result, model-based evaluations of S-map methods become inappropriate. To address these problems, (1) we propose adjusting the diagonal elements of the interaction Jacobian by subtracting 1 to resolve the comparability problem between inter- and intraspecific interaction strengths. Simulations of population dynamics showed that this adjustment prevents overestimation of intraspecific interaction strengths. (2) We introduce an alternative parametric Jacobian and then cumulative interaction strength (CIS), providing a more rigorous benchmark for evaluating S-map methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the numerical gap between CIS and the existing parametric Jacobian is substantial in realistic scenarios, suggesting CIS as preferred benchmark. These solutions offer a clearer framework for developing non-parametric approaches in ecological time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Global attractor and robust exponential attractors for some classes of fourth-order nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to some classes of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs with non-monotone nonlinearities, which include the Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (LLBar) equation (with all relevant fields and spin torques) and the convective Cahn--Hilliard/Allen--Cahn (CH-AC) equation with a proliferation term, in dimensions $d=1,2,3$. Firstly, we show the global well-posedness, as well as the existence of global and exponential attractors with finite fractal dimensions for these problems. In the case of the exchange-dominated LLBar equation and the CH-AC equation without convection, an estimate for the rate of convergence of the solution to the corresponding stationary state is given. Finally, we show the existence of a robust family of exponential attractors when $d\leq 2$. As a corollary, exponential attractor of the LLBar equation is shown to converge to that of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation in the limit of vanishing exchange damping, while exponential attractor of the convective CH-AC equation is shown to converge to that of the convective Allen--Cahn equation in the limit of vanishing diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dirac structures and discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of $(\pm)$-discrete Dirac structures over a manifold, where we define $(\pm)$-discrete two-forms on the manifold and incorporate discrete constraints using $(\pm)$-finite difference maps. Specifically, we develop $(\pm)$-discrete induced Dirac structures as discrete analogues of the induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle over a configuration manifold, as described by Yoshimura and Marsden (2006). We demonstrate that $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems can be naturally formulated in conjunction with the $(\pm)$-induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle. Furthermore, we show that the resulting equations of motion are equivalent to the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert equations proposed in Cort\'es and Mart\'inez (2001) and McLachlan and Perlmutter (2006). We also clarify the variational structures of the discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems within the framework of the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert--Pontryagin principle. Finally, we validate the proposed discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems with some illustrative examples of nonholonomic systems through numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates flat webs on the projective plane. We present two methods for constructing such webs: the first involves taking the product of two convex reduced foliations and invariant lines, while the second consists of taking the product of finitely many convex homogeneous foliations and invariant lines. In both cases, we demonstrate that the dual web is flat.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>Circularity of Thermodynamical Material Networks: Indicators, Examples, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition towards a circular economy has gained importance over the last years since the traditional linear take-make-dispose paradigm is not sustainable in the long term. Recently, thermodynamical material networks (TMNs) [1] have been proposed as an approach to design material flows based on the idea that any supply chain can be seen as a set of thermodynamic compartments that can be added, removed, modified or connected differently. Compared to the well-established material flow analysis (MFA), TMNs leverage dynamical energy balances and ordinary differential equations along with the usual mass balances, thus tackling circular economy as a material network design problem analogous to traditional engineering design approaches (e.g., design of thermodynamic cycles, electrical and hydraulic networks) rather than as an analysis of stock-and-flow data. Hence, TMNs allow the depiction of highly dynamic material stocks and flows whose variations can occur in less than 1 minute; achieving such modelling accuracy with MFA would be more data intensive. In this paper, we first develop several circularity indicators of TMNs using a graph-based formalism. Then, we illustrate their calculation using two numerical examples for the case of fluid materials and one numerical example for the case of solid materials, for which the detailed hybrid dynamical equations and simulation outputs are provided. The paper source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and Cantor set structure of sliding Shilnikov invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of sliding Shilnikov connection has been recently introduced and represents an important notion in Filippov systems, because its existence implies chaotic behavior on an invariant subset of the system. The investigation of its properties has just begun, and understanding the topology and complexity of its invariant set is of interest. In this paper, we conduct a local analysis on the first return map associated to a Shilnikov sliding connection, which reveals a conformal iterated function system (CIFS) structure. By using the theory of CIFS, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the local invariant set of the first return map, showing, in particular, that it is strictly greater than $0$ and strictly less than $1$, and its one-dimensional Lebesgue measure is 0. Moreover, we prove that the closure of the local invariant set is a Cantor set and has the same Hausdorff dimension and Lebesgue measure of the original invariant set. Furthermore, it is given by the invariant set adjoined with the set of all pre-images of the regular-fold point.</description>

Abstract: We show that for every nonarithmetic lattice $\Gamma&lt;{\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ there is a gap $\varepsilon_\Gamma&gt;0$ such that for every $g\in {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ the intersection ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})\cap g\Gamma g^{-1}$ is either a lattice in ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ or has critical exponent $\delta({\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})\cap g\Gamma g^{-1}) \leq 1 - \varepsilon_\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of some non-commuting double ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $T$ be measure-preserving transformations of a probability space $(X,{\mathcal B},\mu)$. Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider the integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages: \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\ d\mu(x) \qquad (n\ge 1).\] We construct examples for which these integrals do not converge as $n\to\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence have entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host.
  Our proof begins with a corresponding construction for orthogonal operators on a Hilbert space, and then obtains transformations of a Gaussian measure space from them.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata, percolation and dynamical dichotomies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between percolation on the Cayley graphs of a group and the dynamical diversity of cellular automata on that group. Specifically, we demonstrate that Gilman's dichotomy between equicontinuity and sensitivity with respect to Bernoulli measures holds on a finitely generated group if and only if the group has a trivial percolation threshold. Consequently, we show that a countable group satisfies Gilman's dichotomy if and only if it is locally virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to sampling and interpolation in unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of covolume for point sets in locally compact groups that simultaneously generalizes the covolume of a lattice and the reciprocal of the Beurling density for amenable, unimodular groups. This notion of covolume arises naturally from transverse measure theory applied to the hull dynamical system associated to a point set. Using groupoid techniques, we prove necessary conditions for sampling and interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on unimodular groups in terms of this new notion of covolume. These conditions generalize previously known density theorems for compactly generated groups of polynomial growth, while also covering important new examples, in particular model sets arising from cut-and-project schemes.</description>
