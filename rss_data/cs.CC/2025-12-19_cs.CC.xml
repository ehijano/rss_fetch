      <title>Good Locally Testable Codes with Small Alphabet and Small Query Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ben-Sasson, Goldreich and Sudan showed that a binary error correcting code admitting a $2$-query tester cannot be good, i.e., it cannot have both linear distance and positive rate. The same holds when the alphabet is a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, the code is $\mathbb{F}$-linear, and the $2$-query tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. We show that those are essentially the only limitations on the existence of good locally testable codes (LTCs). That is, there are good $2$-query LTCs on any alphabet with more than $2$ letters, and good $3$-query LTCs with a binary alphabet. Similarly, there are good $3$-query $\mathbb{F}$-linear LTCs, and for every $\mathbb{F}$-vector space $V$ of dimension greater than $1$, there are good $2$-query LTCs with alphabet $V$ whose tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. This completely solves, for every $q\geq 2$ and alphabet (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-vector space) $\Sigma$, the question of whether there is a good $q$-query LTC (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-LTC) with alphabet $\Sigma$. Our proof builds on the recent good $2$-query $\mathbb{F}$-LTCs of the first author and Kaufman, by establishing a general method for reducing the alphabet size of a low-query LTC.</description>

      <title>Hardness of SetCover Reoptimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hardness of reoptimization of the fundamental and hard to approximate SetCover problem. Reoptimization considers an instance together with a solution and a modified instance where the goal is to approximate the modified instance while utilizing the information gained by solution to the related instance. We study four different types of reoptimization for (weighted) SetCover: adding a set, removing a set, adding an element to the universe, and removing an element from the universe. A few of these cases are known to be easier to approximate than the classic SetCover problem. We show that all the other cases are essentially as hard to approximate as SetCover.
  The reoptimization problem of adding and removing an element in the unweighted case is known to admit a PTAS. For these settings we show that there is no EPTAS under common hardness assumptions via a novel combination of the classic way to show that a reoptimization problem is NP-hard and the relation between EPTAS and FPT.</description>

      <title>Analogicity in List Coloring Problems and Interval $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-choosability: A Complexity-Theoretic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates structural and computational aspects of list-based graph coloring under interval constraints. Building on the framework of analogous and p-analogous problems, we show that classical List Coloring, $\mu$-coloring, and $(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring share strong complexity-preserving correspondences on graph classes closed under pendant-vertex extensions. These equivalences allow hardness and tractability results to transfer directly among the models. Motivated by applications in scheduling and resource allocation with bounded ranges, we introduce the interval-restricted $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring model, where each vertex receives an interval of exactly $k$ consecutive admissible colors. We prove that, although $(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring is NP-complete even on several well-structured graph classes, its $k$-restricted version becomes polynomial-time solvable for any fixed $k$. Extending this formulation, we define $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-choosability and analyze its expressive power and computational limits. Our results show that the number of admissible list assignments is drastically reduced under interval constraints, yielding a more tractable alternative to classical choosability, even though the general decision problem remains located at high levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Overall, the paper provides a unified view of list-coloring variants through structural reductions, establishes new complexity bounds for interval-based models, and highlights the algorithmic advantages of imposing fixed-size consecutive color ranges.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem: $\mathsf{Grundy~Total~Domination}$, $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, and $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when parameterized by the solution size.
  On the other hand, we consider the family of zero forcing problems which form the parametric duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that the dual of $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence. In contrast, we show that $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$ is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for that parameter.</description>

      <title>Models That Prove Their Own Correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured on average over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train Self-Proving models that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm $V$ via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over an input sampled from a given distribution, the model generates a correct output and successfully proves its correctness to $V$. The soundness property of $V$ guarantees that, for every input, no model can convince $V$ of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while all incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by $V$. We devise and analyze two generic methods for learning Self-Proving models: Transcript Learning (TL) which relies on access to transcripts of accepting interactions, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback (RLVF) which trains a model by emulating interactions with the verifier.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

      <title>FPT Parameterisations of Fractional and Generalised Hypertree Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for exact computation of generalized hypertree width (ghw) and fractional hypertree width (fhw). Our algorithms are parameterized by the target width, the rank, and the maximum degree of the input hypergraph. More generally, we show that testing f-width is in FPT for a broad class of width functions that we call manageable. This class contains the edge cover number $\rho$ and its fractional relaxation $\rho^*$, and thus covers both generalized and fractional hypertree width. We additionally extend our framework to also obtain an fpt algorithm for computing a discretized version of adaptive width. Our approach extends a recent algorithm for treewidth (Boja\'ncyk &amp; Pilipczuk, LMCS 2022) that utilises monadic second-order transductions. To extend this idea beyond treewidth we develop new combinatorial machinery around elimination forests in hypergraphs, culminating in a structural normal form for optimal witnesses that makes transduction-based optimisation applicable in the much more general context of manageable width functions. This yields the first exact FPT algorithms for these measures under any nontrivial parameterisation and provides structural tools that may enable more direct optimisation algorithms</description>

      <title>The NPA hierarchy does not always attain the commuting operator value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04943v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable to determine whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is strictly greater than 1/2. Specifically, there is a computable mapping from Turing machines to /boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games in which the halting property of the machine is encoded as a decision problem for the commuting operator value of the game. As a corollary, there is a BCS game for which the value of the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy does not attain the commuting operator value at any finite level.</description>
