      <title>Re-evaluating Lyman $\alpha$ wing opacities and the low mass-problem in cool white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia observations have reignited interest in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) opacity problems of cool white dwarfs ($T_{\rm eff} \leq 6000$ K), which were thought to be resolved nearly two decades ago through the inclusion of Lyman $\alpha$ red wing opacity arising from H-H$_2$ collisions in atmospheric models. Recent studies have revealed that their masses derived from Gaia optical photometry are 0.1$-$0.2 M$_{\odot}$ lower than expected from single-star evolution. Since the Ly $\alpha$ H-H$_2$ wing opacity significantly affects the blue end of their optical spectra, it may contribute to the mass discrepancy. To investigate this hypothesis, we revisited the Ly $\alpha$ opacity calculations in the quasi-static single and multi-perturber approximations by explicitly using the ab initio potential energy data of H$_3$ while fully accounting for the H-H$_2$ collision angle. We find that the opacity is slightly smaller than the standard models at the shortest wavelengths ($\leq5000$ angstrom), but larger at longer wavelengths. Comparing synthetic magnitudes (GALEX, Gaia, WISE) to the observations of the 40 pc white dwarf sample, we note that the revised models tentatively reproduce the observed $NUV-G$ colours for stars cooler than 6000 K, but still fail to match $G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}$ colours, resulting in similarly low inferred masses ($\leq 0.5$ M$_{\odot}$) as obtained with the standard Ly $\alpha$ opacity. Exploring other dominant opacity sources, we discover that decreasing the strength of the bound-free H$^-$ opacity in existing models better reproduces the optical and infrared colours, while collision-induced absorption (CIA) opacity is ineffective in resolving the low-mass problem. We highlight the need for improved opacities and multi-wavelength observations in future studies.</description>

      <title>A Complete Analysis of Subgiant Stellar Systems III: Hip70868</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes "Al-Wardat's method for analysing binary and multiple stellar systems" to estimate a set of parameters for the triple system Hip70868. The method compares the system's observational magnitudes, color indices, and spectral energy distribution (SED) and synthetic SEDs generated through atmospheric modeling of each component. Feedback-adjusted parameters and an iterative approach were employed to achieve the best fit between observational (including the latest measurements of Gaia, release DR3) and synthetic spectral energy distributions. The findings were completed using the distance of 71.89 pc given by Hipparcos 2007's new reduction. The individual components' parameters for the system were derived afterward. The parameters obtained for the individual components are as follows: Component A has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 +- 50 K, a surface gravity (log ga) of 4.50 +- 0.05, and a radius (Ra) of 1.43 +- 0.07 R_sun. Component B has a (Teff) of 5910 +- 50 K, a (log gb) of 4.40 +- 0.05, and a radius (Rb) of 1.35 +- 0.07 R_sun. The spectral types of the components were found to be F9 IV and G1 IV, respectively. The findings from this analysis were utilized to accurately position the two system components on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and the evolutionary tracks. The analysis shows that the components have transitioned from the main sequence to the sub-giant stage of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</description>

      <title>First Time Observed M-Shaped Coronal Mass Ejection Associated with a Blowout Jet and an Extreme Ultraviolet Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal blowout jet, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) are common phenomena in the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we report the occurrence of an M-shaped CME event associated with a blowout jet and an EUV wave using high-resolution, multi-angle and multi-wavelength observations taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory. Interestingly, and for the first time, it is found that two bubble-like CMEs and a jet-like CME were simultaneously triggered by the same eruptive event. Our observational analyses and findings indicate the following: (1) the eruption of a blowout jet led to a large-scale EUV wave; (2) the eruption of the EUV wave swept a small filament (prominence) and a long filament; (3) eventually the EUV wave split-up into two parts, leading to the two bubble-like CMEs, while the blowout jet induced a jet-like CME. The combined events appear to form an M-shape like structure CME, that we sketch throughout a proposed cartoon tentatively explaining the observed complex configuration. Based on observational diagnosis, we argue that the jet, the EUV wave and the multi-CME are highly interlinked. A suggested eruption-model, from the solar atmosphere to the space, is outlined and discussed, providing a possibly new way to probe the relationship between the solar eruptions and the surrounding space. The investigation of such rare phenomenon can be a key point for better understanding of the physical associated triggering mechanisms and energy transport in the solar atmosphere, crucial for MHD simulations and modeling.</description>

      <title>Stellar Loci. IX. Estimation of Stellar Parameters from CSST-like Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct a deep and wide imaging survey in the NUV-, u-, g-, r-, i-, z-, and y-bands. In this work, using theoretical data synthesized from the BOSZ spectra of Bohlin et al. (2017), along with observational data constructed from different sources, we present two methods for estimating stellar parameters from CSST-like photometry. One approach is to estimate metallicity [M/H] and surface gravity log g simultaneously by using the metallicity- and log g-dependent stellar loci. Tests with theoretical data (without photometric errors) result in precisions of 0.088 dex and 0.083 dex for [M/H] and log g, respectively. With 0.01 mag photometric errors, precision is degraded by about a factor of two, due to degeneracy in [M/H] and log g. Tests with observational data, although with larger photometric errors, result in precisions of 0.10 dex and 0.39 dex for [Fe/H] and log g, respectively, thanks to the strong correlation between stellar colors and log g in real data. The other approach is the giant-dwarf loci method to obtain classifications and metallicity estimates. With the same observational data, it achieves a better [Fe/H] precision of 0.084 dex, due to the stronger constraints imposed on log g. The method also performs well in distinguishing giants from dwarfs, particularly for red or metal-poor giants. This work demonstrates the clear potential of the CSST data, paving the way for stellar-parameter estimates for many billions of stars.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of outside-in accretion bursts in embedded protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical and infrared surveys have detected increasing numbers of disc accretion outbursts in young stars. Some models of these FU Ori-type events predict that the outburst should start at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths before an optical rise is detected, and this lag between infrared and optical bursts has been observed in at least two systems. Detecting and characterizing infrared precursors can constrain the outburst trigger region, and thus help identify the mechanism producing the outburst. However, because FU Ori objects are generally young and usually embedded in dusty protostellar envelopes, it is not clear whether or how well such infrared precursors can be detected in the presence of strong envelope extinction. To explore this question, we combine time-dependent outburst models of the inner disc with an outer dusty disc and protostellar envelope, and calculate the resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, for envelope mass infall rates about 10^{-5} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}, where rc is a characteristic inner radius for the infalling envelope, the infrared precursor is only apparent in the SED when viewed along the outflow cavity. At other inclinations, the precursor is most easily distinguished at infall rates of 10^{-6} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}. We also show that far-IR and submm/mm monitoring can enable the indirect detection of precursor evolution long before the optical outburst, emphasizing the potential of long-wavelength monitoring for studying the earliest stages of protostar formation.</description>

      <title>Polarization Diagnostics Applied to Coronal Mass Ejections and the Background Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio of radially to tangentially polarized Thomson-scattered white light provides a powerful tool for locating the 3D position of compact structures in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) has been designed to take full advantage of this diagnostic capability. Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed. In this way, we demonstrate the challenges and opportunities presented by PUNCH polarization data for various quantitative diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Lu and Hamilton model for solar flares over a rewiring complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified Lu \&amp; Hamilton-type model where the neighborhood relations are replaced by topological connections, which can be dynamically altered. The model represents each grid node as a flux tube, as in the classic model, but with connections evolving to capture the complex effects of magnetic reconnection. Through this framework, we analyze how the dissipated energy distribution changes, particularly focusing on the power-law exponent $\alpha_E$, which decreases with respect to the original model due to rewiring effects. When the system is dominated by rewiring, it presents an exponential distribution exponent $\beta_E$, showing a faster decay of dissipated energy than in the original model. This leads to microflare-dominated dynamics at short timescales, causing the system to lose the scale-free behavior observed in both the original model (Lu \&amp; Hamilton 1991) and in configurations where energy release is primarily driven by forcing rather than rewiring.
  Our results reveal a clear transition from power-law to exponential regimes as the rewiring probability increases, fundamentally altering the energy distribution characteristics of the system. In contrast, when considering topological neighbors instead of local ones, the model's dynamics become intrinsically nonlocal. This leads to scaling exponents comparable to those reported in other nonlocal dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Seven Cold and Distant Brown Dwarfs with JWST RUBIES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report near-infrared spectral model fits to seven distant L- and T-type dwarfs observed with the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as part of the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES). Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8, and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both many be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\mu$m CO band. This work aims to guide ongoing JWST, Euclid, and other space-based spectral surveys that are expected to uncover thousands of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs throughout the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Velocity field of an Active Region filament from GRIS IR He I and IRIS UV observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma flow measurements in solar active region filaments are rare, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges that probe the chromosphere and transition region. In addition, previous studies generally focused on prominences and filaments near the solar limb. This study presents a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument analysis of an active region filament observed on the solar disk on November 9 and 10, 2020. Our goal is to characterize the plasma flows in the filament using spectroscopic measurements in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges. This is important for understanding the mechanisms for filament support, mass loading, and energy balance. Furthermore, this also offers observational benchmarks for filament modeling and simulations. Spectra from the IRIS satellite, including the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines were analyzed alongside ground-based observations from the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and High-resolution Fast Imager instruments whose observed spectral ranges include the chromospheric He I and H{\alpha} lines. Persistent blueshifts were measured within the filament structure in both spectral ranges. These can be interpreted as upflow velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 km s^-1, with the Si IV showing the highest values. Red shifted emission in the He I and Mg II k3 at the footpoints of a newly formed dark bundle suggest chromospheric downflows, likely due to spatial overlap between an arch filament system close to the filament footpoints. The weak redshifted signal in the Si IV emission may suggest confinement to lower atmospheric layers. The observed velocity patterns provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and coherent view of the plasma dynamics from the chromosphere to the transition region, illustrating that the filament emission is consistently blueshifted in all the spectral windows, and thus in different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Populations of tidal and pulsating variables in eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.</description>

      <title>Origin of Joy's Law in the context of Near-Surface Convection on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joy's law is a well-established statistical property of solar active regions that any theory of active region emergence must explain. This tilt angle of the active region away from an east-west alignment is a critical component for converting the toroidal magnetic field to poloidal magnetic field in some leading dynamo theories, and observations show they are important for the reversal of the sign of the global solar magnetic dipole. This review aims to synthesise observational results related to the onset of Joy's law, placing them within the broader context that describes active region emergence as a largely passive process occurring near the surface of the Sun.</description>

Abstract: One of the most efficient and reliable observational technique allowing to probe the internal structure of a star is the determination of the apsidal motion in close eccentric binaries. This secular precession of the binary orbit's major axis depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the two stars. Its rate is directly related to the internal structure of the stars, in particular their inner density profile. Combining radial velocity and light curve data over a long timescale, the apsidal motion rate can be constrained, together with the fundamental parameters of the stars. Confrontation of observational parameters to stellar models then allows us to constrain the internal structure of stars. This powerful technique has been known for years but has been seldom applied to massive stars. I highlight its interest and reveal recent results concerning several massive binaries. While standard stellar models predict stars having a smaller internal stellar structure constant, that is to say, stars having a smaller density contrast, than expected from observations, I demonstrate that the addition of mixing inside the models helps to solve, at least partially, this discrepancy. Studies with the non-perturbative code MoBiDICT showed that the perturbative model assumption is not justified in highly distorted stars, in which cases the apsidal motion is underestimated, exacerbating even more the need for enhanced mixing inside the models. But what happens if the binary is a double-line spectroscopic but non-eclipsing binary? In that case, we indeed have no estimate of the masses and radii of the stars. Surprisingly, the apsidal motion equations combined with the binary' spectroscopic observations allow us to derive the masses of the stars, in a model-dependent way. Rodolfo Barb\'a contributed to the development of this original method that I bring out.</description>

      <title>Swaying oscillations in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cast new light on solar convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontally-periodic Boussinesq Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) is a simple model system to study the formation of large-scale structures in turbulent convective flows. We performed a suite of 2D numerical simulations of RBC between no-slip boundaries at different Prandtl (Pr) and Rayleigh (Ra) numbers, such that their product is representative of the Sun's upper convection zone. When the fluid viscosity is sufficiently low (Pr $\lesssim 0.1$) and turbulence is strong (Ra $&gt; 10^6$) we find that large structures begin to couple in time and space. For Pr = 0.01 we observe long-lived swaying oscillations of the upflows and downflows, which synchronize over multiple convection cells. This new regime of oscillatory convection may offer an interpretation for the wave-like properties of the dominant scale of convection on the Sun (supergranulation).</description>

      <title>Solar cycle evolution of ICME sheath regions at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheath regions at 1 AU across solar cycles 23, 24, and the rising phase of 25, focusing on their variability and turbulence in relation to upstream solar wind conditions and the global heliospheric state. Using a dataset of over 900 ICME sheath events, we apply statistical metrics such as the interquartile range (IQR) and the Turbulence Index (TI) to quantify variability and turbulence. The analysis compares full and rising phases of solar cycles and examines both local ICME parameters (e.g., sheath total pressure, non-radial flows) and global interplanetary indicators such as open solar flux (OSF). From SC23 to SC24, sheath total pressure and magnetic field strength decreased by over 40% and 25%, respectively, accompanied by reduced turbulence and variability. In contrast, the rising phase of SC25 shows increased magnetic complexity, particularly in non-radial field components, despite stable bulk parameters. Non-radial flow patterns also shift from tangentially dominated in SC23-SC24 to normal-dominated in SC25, suggesting changes in ICME orientation and sheath formation mechanisms. No significant correlation is found between OSF and sheath properties, indicating that local solar wind and ICME specific factors are the primary drivers of sheath evolution. The study reinforces the importance of upstream solar wind dynamics in relation to variations in plasma and magnetic field measured components of ICME sheaths. The derived trends in turbulence, magnetic orientation, and flow geometry suggest that sheath regions are sensitive indicators of solar cycle phase and should be considered as distinct, structured components in ICME modeling.</description>

      <title>Observing the solar corona from a formation-flying mission. First results of Proba-3/ASPIICS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first results from observations of the solar corona by the ASPIICS coronagraph aboard the Proba-3 mission. ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun) is a giant coronagraph consisting of the telescope mounted aboard one of the mission's spacecraft and the external occulter placed on the second spacecraft. The two spacecraft separated by around 144 m fly in a precise formation up to 5.5 hours at a time, which allows coronal observations in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the limb (typically down to 1.099 Rs, occasionally down to 1.05 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS observes quasi-stationary structures, such as coronal loops, streamers, quiescent prominences, and a variety of dynamic phenomena: erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections, jets, slow solar wind outflows, coronal inflows. In particular, weak, widespread and persistent small-scale outflows and inflows between 1.3 and 3 Rs are observed at a high spatial (5.6 arcsec) and temporal (30 s) resolution for the first time, expanding the range of scales at which the variable slow solar wind is observed to form.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): V721 CrA and BN CrA have wide and structured disks in polarised IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme. Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the "on-cloud" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older "off-cloud" group.</description>

      <title>Chromosphere of the quiet sun -- I. Shock and current-sheet dynamics and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar chromosphere is a crucial interface between the solar interior and its interplanetary environment, regulating how energy is locally deposited into heat and transported into the upper atmospheric layers. Despite significant progress, the dominant processes responsible for chromospheric heating remain debated, particularly under quiet-Sun (QS) conditions. We aim to disentangle and quantify the respective roles of shocks and current sheets (CS) in QS chromospheric modeling. We use a simulation performed with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost. In order to identify shocks and CS events across space and time, we develop and apply physics-based criteria, allowing us to describe their dynamics and evaluate their contributions to both dissipative (viscous and ohmic) and mechanical (including compressive work) heating. Shocks are found to dominate the energy deposition in the lower chromosphere (up to $59\%$ of the mechanical heating), while CS become the primary contributor in the upper chromosphere, as both plasma $\beta$ and Mach number $Ma$ drop. Overall, $66\%$ of the mechanical chromospheric heating is powered by the combined action of shocks and CS. These results support a multi-process view of the chromospheric heating in the QS, dominated by shocks, CS, and non-steep gradient dynamics. In addition to viscous and ohmic dissipation, compressive heating can play a major role locally in the model, particularly in chromospheric shock structures, where it offsets non-reversibly cooling from expansion and radiation, and therefore constitutes a key heating contribution to consider in the energy budget. This study further highlights the need for next-generation observations to resolve the intermittent and small-scale nature of chromospheric dynamics, in order to bring new constraints on the coupling between the different layers of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Black Holes at high and low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the end of their lives the most massive stars collapse into black holes (BHs). The detection of an 85 $M_{\odot}$ BH from GW 190521 appeared to challenge the upper-mass limit imposed by pair-instability (PI). Using systematic MESA calculations with new mass-loss implementations, we show that 100 $M_{\odot}$ stars at metallicities below 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ can evolve into blue supergiant progenitors with cores small enough to avoid PI, yet with limited envelope loss, yielding remnants within the second mass gap. The key ingredients involve (i) a proper consideration of internal mixing and (ii) physically motivated stellar winds. Our modelling provides a robust pathway that roughly doubles the maximum BH mass permitted by PI theory and establish a physically-consistent framework to explore the upper BH mass limit versus metallicity. For rapid rotation ($\ge$50\% of critical), the upper BH mass comes down to $\simeq$35 $M_{\odot}$, matching the LIGO/Virgo BH mass pile-up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <title>Photoevaporation Can Reproduce Extended $\mathrm{H_2}$ Emission from Protoplanetary Disks Imaged by JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dispersal of protoplanetary disks remains a central challenge in planet formation theory. Disk winds, driven by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and/or photoevaporation, are now recognized as primary agents of dispersal. With the advent of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spatially resolved imaging of these winds, particularly in H2 pure rotational lines, has become possible, revealing X-shaped morphologies and integrated fluxes of $\sim 10^{-16}$-$10^{-15}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. However, the lack of theoretical models suitable for direct comparison has limited interpretation of these features. To address this, we present the first model of photoevaporative \ce{H2} winds tailored for direct comparison with JWST observations. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled with chemistry, we derive steady-state wind structures and post-process them to compute H2 level populations and line radiative transfer, including collisional excitation and spontaneous decay. Our synthetic images reproduce the observed X-shaped morphology with radial extents of $\gtrsim 50$-$300{\rm \,au}$ and semi-opening angles of $\sim 37^\circ$-$50^\circ$, matching observations of Tau 042021 and SY Cha. While the predicted line fluxes are somewhat lower than the observed values. These results suggest that photoevaporation is a viable mechanism for reproducing key features of observed H2 winds, including morphology and fluxes, though conclusive identification of the wind origin requires source-specific modeling. This challenges the reliance on geometrical structures alone to distinguish between MHD winds and photoevaporation. Based on our findings, we also discuss alternative diagnostics of photoevaporative winds. This work provides a critical first step toward interpreting spatially resolved H2 winds and motivates future modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 -- I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</description>

      <title>Secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs in the K2 fields: detection by multiple dataset merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using various data sources for the stellar fluxes in overlapping campaign fields and employing full time series modeling, we report the detection of the secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs (CWW 89Ab = EPIC 219388192b and HSHJ 430b = EPIC 211946007b). The detections yielded timings in agreement with the orbital elements derived from the earlier radial velocity measurements and eclipse depths of 70+/-12 ppm (CWW 89Ab) and 852+/-123 ppm (HSHJ 430b). While the high depth in the Kepler waveband for HSHJ 430b is in agreement with the assumption that the emitted flux comes mostly from the internal heat source and the absorbed stellar irradiation, the case of CWW 89Ab suggests very high albedo, because of the lack of sufficient thermal radiation in the Kepler waveband. Assuming completely reflective dayside hemisphere, without circulation, the maximum value of the eclipse depth due to the reflection of the stellar light is 56 ppm. By making the extreme assumption that the true eclipse depth is 3 sigma less than the observed depth, the minimum geometric albedo becomes ~0.6.</description>

      <title>Chasing the storm: Investigating the application of high-contrast imaging techniques in producing precise exoplanet light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substellar companions such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs exhibit changes in brightness arising from top-of-atmosphere inhomogeneities, providing insights into their atmospheric structure and dynamics. This variability can be measured in the light curves of high-contrast companions from the ground by combining differential spectrophotometric monitoring techniques with high-contrast imaging. However, ground-based observations are sensitive to the effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, and while adaptive optics (AO) systems and bespoke data processing techniques help to mitigate these, residual systematics can limit photometric precision. Here, we inject artificial companions to data obtained with an AO system and a vector Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph to test the level to which telluric and other systematics contaminate such light curves, and thus how well their known variability signals can be recovered. We find that varying companions are distinguishable from non-varying companions, but that variability amplitudes and periods cannot be accurately recovered when observations cover only a small number of periods. Residual systematics remain above the photon noise in the light curves but have not yet reached a noise floor. We also simulate observations to assess how specific systematic sources, such as non-common path aberrations and AO residuals, can impact aperture photometry as a companion moves through pupil-stabilised data. We show that only the lowest-order aberrations are likely to affect flux measurements, but that thermal background noise is the dominant source of scatter in raw companion photometry. Predictive control and focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques will help to further reduce systematics in data of this type.</description>

      <title>On the nature and Galactic origin of the Be binary MWC 656. New insights from VLA, Gaia, and Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary star MWC 656 was initially proposed as the first confirmed system composed of a Be star and a black hole. However, recent studies have challenged this interpretation, suggesting that the compact companion is unlikely to be a black hole. In this study, we revisit the nature of MWC 656 by analyzing archival data across multiple wavelengths, including radio observations from the VLA, optical astrometry from the Gaia satellite, and high-energy $\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi-LAT. Using all available VLA observations at X-band (8.0-12.0 GHz), we produce the deepest radio map toward this system to date, with a noise level of 780 nJy beam$^{-1}$. The source MWC 656 is detected with $S_\nu=4.6\pm0.8\mu$Jy and a spectral index of $\alpha=1.2\pm1.8$, derived by sub-band imaging. The radio and X-ray luminosity ratio of MWC 656 is consistent with both the fundamental plane of accreting black holes and with the G\"udel-Benz relation for magnetically active stars, leaving the emission mechanism ambiguous. The optical astrometric results of MWC 656 indicate a peculiar velocity of $11.2\pm2.3$ km s$^{-1}$, discarding it as a runaway star. Its current location, 442 pc below the Galactic plane, implies a vertical travel time incompatible with the lifetime of a B1.5-type star. Moreover, the agreement between observed and expected motion in all three velocity components argues against a deceleration scenario, suggesting that MWC 656 likely formed in situ at high Galactic latitude. We carried out maximum likelihood analysis of Fermi-LAT data, but cannot report a significant detection of $\gamma$-ray emission from this source. These results reinforce recent evidence that challenge the black hole companion interpretation, and favor a non-BH compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star.</description>

      <title>Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). VIII : Kinematic Characterization and Identification of Radial Velocity Variables for the LAMOST-Gaia-TESS Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered over 6700 nearby exoplanets candidates using the transit method through its all-sky survey. Characterizing the kinematic properties and identifying variable stars for the TESS stellar sample is crucial for revealing the correlations between the properties of planetary systems and the properties of stars (e.g., Galactic components, age, chemistry, dynamics, radiation). Based on data from TESS, Gaia DR3, and LAMOST DR10, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, orbits, Galactic components, and kinematic age) as well as other basic stellar parameters for $\sim 660,000$ TESS stars. Our analysis of the kinematic catalog reveals that stars belonging to different Galactic components (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, halo and 12 streams in the disk) display distinctive kinematic and chemical properties. We also find that hot planets with period less then 10 days in the TESS sample favor thin disk stars compared to thick disk stars, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, using the LAMOST multiple-epoch observations, we identify 41,445 stars exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, among which 7,846 are classified as binary stars. By fitting the radial velocity curves, we further derive orbital parameters (e.g., mass ratio, orbital period and eccentricity) for 297 binaries. The observed decreasing orbital eccentricity with shorting period reveals evidence of tidal circularization. The catalogs constructed in this work have laid a solid foundation for future work on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems in different Galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the remarkable planet-hosting wide binary system HD 202772A/B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed spectroscopic and photometric characterization of the planet-hosting wide binary HD 202772A/B. No planet has been detected around HD 202772B, whereas HD 202772A, more evolved than its companion and near the end of its main-sequence (MS) phase, hosts a transiting hot Jupiter. The system has one of the hottest components ($T_{\mathrm{eff}; A} \sim 6440$ K) and one of the largest surface gravity differences between components ($\Delta\log g_{A-B} \sim 0.4$ dex) among MS planet-hosting wide binaries. Using a global fit including our stellar parameters, radial velocities, and new TESS data, we derive refined properties of the planet orbiting HD 202772A, finding it to be the most irradiated hot Jupiter known in a wide binary. We also constrain the presence of additional transiting planets around HD 202772A and new transiting planets around HD 202772B using TESS photometry. We derive high-precision, strictly differential abundances for 27 species based on Gemini-GRACES spectra. HD 202772A shows lower lithium abundance (by 0.45 dex) relative to B, consistent with their stellar parameter differences. We also detect a small but significant enhancement in refractory elements in HD 202772A, particularly those with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (+0.018 $\pm$ 0.004 dex). We explored several scenarios to explain the observed chemical anomalies. Our analysis suggests that rocky planet engulfment, primordial inhomogeneities, and $\delta$ Scuti-related effects are unlikely to fully account for the chemical pattern. Instead, the differences observed in certain refractory elements might support atomic diffusion as the most plausible explanation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of "hit-and-run" collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</description>

      <title>A Census of NUV M-Dwarf Flares Using Archival GALEX Data and the gPhoton2 Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M-dwarfs are common stellar hosts of habitable-zone exoplanets. NUV radiation can severely impact the atmospheric and surface conditions of such planets, making characterization of NUV flaring activity a key aspect in determining habitability. We use archival data from the GALEX and XMM-Newton telescopes to study the flaring activity of M-dwarfs in the NUV. The GALEX observations form the most extensive dataset of M-dwarfs in the NUV to date, with exploitation of this data possible due to the new gPhoton2 pipeline. We run a dedicated algorithm to detect flares in the pipeline produced lightcurves and find some of the most energetic flares observed to date within the NUV bandpass, with energies of $\sim10^{34}$ ergs. Using GALEX data, we constrain flare frequency distributions for stars from M0 to M6 in the NUV up to $10^5\,$s in equivalent duration and $10^{34}$ ergs in energy, orders of magnitude above any previous study in the UV. We speculate the combined effect of NUV luminosities and flare rates of M4 and later stars could potentially allow abiogenesis on their habitable zone exoplanets. As a counterpoint, we estimate that the high frequencies of energetic UV flares and associated coronal mass ejections would inhibit the formation of an ozone layer, possibly preventing genesis of complex Earth-like lifeforms due to sterilizing levels of surface UV radiation. We also provide a framework for future observations of M-dwarfs with ULTRASAT, a wide FoV NUV telescope to be launched in 2027.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Radiation-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Luminous Red Novae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen and helium recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM and the viewing angle. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solar Low-Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) on board India's Aditya-L1 mission was launched on 2 September 2023 and commenced solar observations on 13 December 2023 following successful aperture cover deployment. Operating from the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, SoLEXS has been providing continuous Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray spectroscopy across 2-22 keV with 170 eV resolution at 5.9 keV and 1-second temporal cadence since 6 January 2024. The instrument employs two Silicon Drift Detectors with aperture areas of 7.1 mm$^2$ and 0.1 mm$^2$ to accommodate the full dynamic range of solar activity from A-class to X-class flares. This paper presents comprehensive ground and on board calibration procedures that establish SoLEXS's quantitative spectroscopic capabilities. Ground calibration encompassed energy-channel relationships, spectral resolution characterization, instrument response functions, and collimator angular response measurements, with thermo-vacuum testing validating performance stability across operational temperature ranges. On board calibration utilizing an internal $^{55}$Fe source demonstrated preserved post-launch spectral resolution (164.9-171.2 eV), while cross-calibration with GOES-XRS and Chandrayaan-2/XSM confirmed radiometric accuracy and flux agreement. The instrument's 100% observational duty cycle at L1 enables unprecedented continuous monitoring of solar flare evolution across all intensity classes, providing calibrated data for advancing coronal heating mechanisms, flare energetics, and flare-coronal mass ejection relationship studies through soft X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 Open Cluster Cepheids: A Unified Catalog with Calibrated Period-Age and Period-Wesenheit Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (CCs) in Galactic open clusters (OCs) provide essential observational constraints for calibrating the period-age relation (PAR) and the period-Wesenheit relation (PWR) of CCs. However, distant and long-period OC Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the 41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age = (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc. Moreover, the PAR and PWR are improved by incorporating refined OC ages and updated parallaxes, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute fitted peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.49\pm0.18\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared polarization of the black hole X-ray binary A0620-00 in quiescence</title>

Abstract: We present simultaneous high-precision optical polarimetric and near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) photometric observations of low-mass black hole X-ray binary A0620-00 in the quiescent state. Subtracting interstellar polarization, estimated from a sample of field stars, we derive the intrinsic polarization of A0620-00. We show that the intrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\sim0.3\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations is the best. This implies that some fraction of the optical polarization is produced by a scattering of stellar radiation off the matter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a rotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the wavelength from $163\deg$ in the $R$ to $177\deg$ in the $B$ band. All of the above, combined with the historical NIR-to-optical polarimetric observations, demonstrates the complex behavior of the average intrinsic polarization of A0620-00: the PA continuously rotates from the infrared to the blue band by $\sim53\deg$ in total, while the PD of $\sim1\%$ remains nearly constant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can be described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad $\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding the black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation of the peculiar wavelength dependence is an interplay between two polarized components with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can help in distinguishing between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</title>

Abstract: Globular clusters host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures suggest early (3 Myr - 1 Gyr) retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the evolution of gas in young globular clusters, and its implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. We show that low-velocity AGB winds are gravitationally retained in clusters more massive than a few 10^5 MSun. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions agree well with the observed second population fractions in Galactic globular clusters. Furthermore, the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Time-dependent core-halo models indicate that compact objects can grow and collapse within 100 Myr - 1 Gyr, while lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes, including accretion luminosity onto compact objects, novae, pulsar winds, and binary supernovae, will clear the gas by 1 Gyr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</description>

      <title>The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</title>

Abstract: Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</description>
