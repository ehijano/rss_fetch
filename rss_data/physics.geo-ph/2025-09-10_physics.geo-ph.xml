      <title>An analytical framework to assess static versus dynamic triggering of fault-slip rockbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-slip rockbursts, triggered by seismic rupture of nearby or remote faults, constitute a significant geohazard during deep underground excavations. Although these events occur frequently in underground projects, their underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Most studies tacitly assume dynamic stress waves as the main triggering factor, often disregarding the role of coseismic static stress changes associated with fault slip. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework to diagnose both static and dynamic coseismic stress perturbations and quantify their contributions to fault-slip rockburst around a circular tunnel. Building on linear elastic fracture mechanics, seismic source theory, and the Kirsch solution, the model assesses whether coseismically elevated maximum tangential stress on the tunnel boundary under static and dynamic triggering effects is sufficient to induce failure around the tunnel. We extensively test our framework using synthetic case studies that represent typical fault-slip rockburst scenarios. Our results yield a rockburst hazard map that delineates regions of elevated triggering potential in the near-field and far-field of the seismogenic fault, and classify the triggering types as static, dynamic, or dual. We perform a comprehensive parametric sensitivity analysis to investigate how key factors, including seismic source characteristics, rock mass properties, and in-situ stress conditions, influence the spatial distribution of rockburst susceptibility. The model is further applied to a historical fault-slip rockburst event at the Gotthard Base Tunnel, effectively capturing the triggering mechanism of the observed failure. Our research provides a physically grounded and computationally efficient analytical framework with the results carrying significant implications for rockburst hazard assessments during deep underground excavations.</description>

      <title>Backward similarity solution of the Boussinesq groundwater equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal impermeable layer with a boundary condition of a rapid increase in the source water level is considered in this work. The newly introduced condition, referred to as the backward power-law head condition, represents a situation where the water level in the adjacent water body increases more rapidly than do conventional problems, which can only represent a situation akin to a traveling wave under rising water level conditions, given its consideration of infinite time. This problem admits the similarity transformation which allows the nonlinear partial differential equation to be converted into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation via the Boltzmann transformation. The reduced boundary value problem is interpreted as the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which can be numerically solved via Shampine's method. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with Kalashinikov's special solution, which is also introduced into the Boussinesq equation. We find that the solution is consistent with the limit of the forward power-law head condition. The new approximate analytical solution and the associated wetting front position are derived by assuming that the solution has the form of quadratic polynomials, which enables the description of the time progression of a real front position. The obtained approximation is compared to Shampine's solution to check the accuracy. Furthermore, the finite element method is applied to the original partial differential equation (PDE), which validates Shampine's solution for use as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in two-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>
