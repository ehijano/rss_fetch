      <title>Exascale Simulations of Fusion and Fission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss pioneering heat and fluid flow simulations of fusion and fission energy systems with NekRS on exascale computing facilities, including Frontier and Aurora. The Argonne-based code, NekRS, is a highly-performant open-source code for the simulation of incompressible and low-Mach fluid flow, heat transfer, and combustion with a particular focus on turbulent flows in complex domains. It is based on rapidly convergent high-order spectral element discretizations that feature minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion. State-of-the-art multilevel preconditioners, efficient high-order time-splitting methods, and runtime-adaptive communication strategies are built on a fast OCCA-based kernel library, libParanumal, to provide scalability and portability across the spectrum of current and future high-performance computing platforms. On Frontier, Nek5000/RS has achieved an unprecedented milestone in breaching over 1 trillion degrees of freedom with the spectral element methods for the simulation of the CHIMERA fusion technology testing platform. We also demonstrate for the first time the use of high-order overset grids at scale.</description>

      <title>Integrating Data Mining and Predictive Modeling Techniques for Enhanced Retail Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive modeling and time-pattern analysis are increasingly critical in this swiftly shifting retail environment to improve operational efficiency and informed decision-making. This paper reports a comprehensive application of state-of-the-art machine learning to the retailing domain with a specific focus on association rule mining, sequential pattern mining, and time-series forecasting. Association rules: Relationship Mining This provides the key product relationships and customer buying patterns that form the basis of individually tailored marketing campaigns. Sequential pattern mining: Using the PrefixSpan algorithm, it identifies frequent sequences of purchasing products-extremely powerful insights into consumer behavior and also better management of the inventories. What is applied for sales trend forecasting models Prophet applies on historical transaction data over seasonality, holidays, and long-term growth. The forecast results allow predicting demand variations, thus helping in proper inventory alignment and avoiding overstocking or understocking of inventory. Our results are checked through the help of metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure our predictions are strong and accurate. We will combine the aspects of all of these techniques to prove how predictive modeling and temporal pattern analysis can help optimize control over inventory, enhance marketing effectiveness, and position retail businesses as they rise to ever greater heights. This entire methodology demonstrates the flexibility with which data-driven strategies can be leveraged to revitalize traditional retailing practices.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Optimization for Efficient V2G Coordination in Distribution Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), maintaining power grid stability has become a significant challenge. To address this issue, EV scheduling control strategies have been developed to manage vehicle-to-grid (V2G) in coordination with the optimal power flow. In existing studies, such coordination optimization is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP), which is computationally challenging due to the binary EV charging and discharging variables. To address this challenge, we develop an efficient two-stage optimization method for this mixed-integer nonlinear coordination problem. This method first employs an efficient technique called the difference of convex (DC) to relax the integrality and reformulate MINP into a series of path-following continuous programming. Although the DC approach shows promising efficiency for solving MINP, it cannot guarantee the feasibility of the solutions. Consequently, we propose a trust region optimization method in stage two that constructs a trust region around DC's solution and then searches for the best feasible solution within this region. Our simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the open-source optimization solver SCIP, our proposed method significantly enhances computational efficiency while achieving near optimality.</description>

      <title>DRLinSPH: An open-source platform using deep reinforcement learning and SPHinXsys for fluid-structure-interaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems are characterized by strong nonlinearities arising from complex interactions between fluids and structures. These pose significant challenges for traditional control strategies in optimizing structural motion, often leading to suboptimal performance. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), through agent interactions within numerical simulation environments and the approximation of control policies using deep neural networks (DNNs), has shown considerable promise in addressing high-dimensional FSI problems. Additionally, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) offers a flexible and efficient computational approach for modeling large deformations, fractures, and complex interface movements inherent in FSI, outperforming traditional grid-based methods. In this work, we present DRLinSPH, an open-source Python platform that integrates the SPH-based numerical environment provided by the open-source software SPHinXsys with the mature DRL platform Tianshou to enable parallel training for FSI problems. DRLinSPH has been successfully applied to four FSI scenarios: sloshing suppression using rigid and elastic baffles, optimization of wave energy capture through an oscillating wave surge converter (OWSC), and muscle-driven fish swimming in vortices. The results demonstrate the platform's accuracy, stability, and scalability, highlighting its potential to advance industrial solutions for complex FSI challenges.</description>

      <title>Solving Electromagnetic Scattering Problems by Isogeometric Analysis with Deep Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid approach combining isogeometric analysis with deep operator networks to solve electromagnetic scattering problems. The neural network takes a computer-aided design representation as input and predicts the electromagnetic field in a de Rham conforming B-spline basis such that for example the tangential continuity of the electric field is respected. The physical problem is included in the loss function during training. Our numerical results demonstrate that a trained network accurately predicts the electric field, showing convergence to the analytical solution with optimal rate. Additionally, training on a variety of geometries highlights the network's generalization capabilities, achieving small error increases when applied to new geometries not included in the training set.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous computing in a strongly-connected CPU-GPU environment: fast multiple time-evolution equation-based modeling accelerated using data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing method for solving time-evolution partial differential equation problems many times with guaranteed accuracy, in short time-to-solution and low energy-to-solution. On a single-GH200 node, the proposed method improved the computation speed by 86.4 and 8.67 times compared to the conventional method run only on CPU and only on GPU, respectively. Furthermore, the energy-to-solution was reduced by 32.2-fold (from 9944 J to 309 J) and 7.01-fold (from 2163 J to 309 J) when compared to using only the CPU and GPU, respectively. Using the proposed method on the Alps supercomputer, a 51.6-fold and 6.98-fold speedup was attained when compared to using only the CPU and GPU, respectively, and a high weak scaling efficiency of 94.3% was obtained up to 1,920 compute nodes. These implementations were realized using directive-based parallel programming models while enabling portability, indicating that directives are highly effective in analyses in heterogeneous computing environments.</description>

      <title>4Doodle: Two-handed Gestures for Immersive Sketching of Architectural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18887v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional immersive sketching for content creation and modeling has been studied for some time. However, research in this domain mainly focused on CAVE-like scenarios. These setups can be expensive and offer a narrow interaction space. Building more affordable setups using head-mounted displays is possible, allowing greater immersion and a larger space for user physical movements. This paper presents a fully immersive environment using bi-manual gestures to sketch and create content freely in the virtual world. This approach can be applied to many scenarios, allowing people to express their ideas or review existing designs. To cope with known motor difficulties and inaccuracy of freehand 3D sketching, we explore proxy geometry and a laser-like metaphor to draw content directly from models and create content surfaces. Our current prototype offers 24 cubic meters for movement, limited by the room size. It features infinite virtual drawing space through pan and scale techniques and is larger than the typical 6-sided cave at a fraction of the cost. In a preliminary study conducted with architects and engineers, our system showed a clear promise as a tool for sketching and 3D content creation in virtual reality with a great emphasis on bi-manual gestures.</description>

      <title>Analysis on Riemann Hypothesis with Cross Entropy Optimization and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis [27], which is composed of three key components: a) probabilistic modeling with cross entropy optimization and reasoning; b) the application of the law of large numbers; c) the application of mathematical inductions. The analysis is mainly conducted by virtue of probabilistic modeling of cross entropy optimization and reasoning with rare event simulation techniques. The application of the law of large numbers [2, 3, 6] and the application of mathematical inductions make the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis self-contained and complete to make sure that the whole complex plane is covered as conjectured in Riemann Hypothesis. We also discuss the method of enhanced top-p sampling with large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, where next token prediction is not just based on the estimated probabilities of each possible token in the current round but also based on accumulated path probabilities among multiple top-k chain of thoughts (CoTs) paths. The probabilistic modeling of cross entropy optimization and reasoning may suit well with the analysis of Riemann Hypothesis as Riemann Zeta functions are inherently dealing with the sums of infinite components of a complex number series.
  We hope that our analysis in this paper could shed some light on some of the insights of Riemann Hypothesis. The framework and techniques presented in this paper, coupled with recent developments with chain of thought (CoT) or diagram of thought (DoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) [1, 7, 18, 21, 24, 34, 39-41], could pave the way for eventual proof of Riemann Hypothesis [27].</description>

      <title>SARDet-100K: Towards Open-Source Benchmark and ToolKit for Large-Scale SAR Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising &lt;2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.</description>

      <title>ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require robust analysis tools for optimization and commercialization. This study proposes a rapid and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG). The model, featuring a parameterized gear geometry and adjustable flux tube distribution, accommodates nonlinear effects like magnetic saturation while maintaining quick simulation times. Comparison with a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) model demonstrates the MEC's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions across diverse designs. Additionally, a parametric optimization study of 140,000 designs confirms the MEC's high accuracy, achieving close agreement with FEA torque predictions, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Finally, the MEC shows good agreement with 2D FEA for a prototype RFMG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation (https://github.com/WillHua127/ReactZyme).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Inverse Design of Mechanical Multi-Material Metamaterials Enabled by Video Denoising Diffusion and Structure Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials, synthetic materials with customized properties, have emerged as a promising field due to advancements in additive manufacturing. These materials derive unique mechanical properties from their internal lattice structures, which are often composed of multiple materials that repeat geometric patterns. While traditional inverse design approaches have shown potential, they struggle to map nonlinear material behavior to multiple possible structural configurations. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging video diffusion models, a type of generative artificial Intelligence (AI), for inverse multi-material design based on nonlinear stress-strain responses. Our approach consists of two key components: (1) a fields generator using a video diffusion model to create solution fields based on target nonlinear stress-strain responses, and (2) a structure identifier employing two UNet models to determine the corresponding multi-material 2D design. By incorporating multiple materials, plasticity, and large deformation, our innovative design method allows for enhanced control over the highly nonlinear mechanical behavior of metamaterials commonly seen in real-world applications. It offers a promising solution for generating next-generation metamaterials with finely tuned mechanical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.</description>
