      <title>Exploring Dark Forces with Multimessenger Studies of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of dark sector interactions via gravitational waves (GWs) from binary inspirals has been a subject of recent interest. We study dark forces using extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), pointing out two issues of interest. Firstly, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the EMRI, which sets the characteristic length scale of the system and hence the dark force range to which it exhibits enhanced sensitivity, probes force mediator masses that complement those studied with supermassive black hole (SMBH) or neutron star binaries. The LISA mission (the proposed $\mu$Ares detector) will probe mediators with masses $m_V \sim 10^{-16}~{\rm eV}$ ($m_V \sim 10^{-18}~{\rm eV}$), corresponding to ISCOs of $10^6 M_\odot$ ($10^8 M_\odot$) central SMBHs. Secondly, while the sensitivity to dark couplings is typically limited by the uncertainty in the binary component masses, independent mass measurements of the central SMBH through reverberation mapping campaigns or the motion of dynamical tracers enable one to break this degeneracy. Our results, therefore, highlight the necessity for coordinated studies, loosely referred to as "multimessenger", between future $\mu{\rm Hz}-{\rm mHz}$ GW observatories and ongoing and forthcoming SMBH mass measurement campaigns, including OzDES-RM, SDSS-RM, and SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper.</description>

      <title>Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Detecting a Jet in Sagittarius A* with VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the horizon-scale emission around the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) favor accretion flow models with a jet component. However, this jet has not been conclusively detected. Using the "best-bet" models of Sgr A* from the EHT collaboration, we assess whether this non-detection is expected for current facilities and explore the prospects of detecting a jet with VLBI at four frequencies: 86, 115, 230, and 345 GHz. We produce synthetic image reconstructions for current and next-generation VLBI arrays at these frequencies that include the effects of interstellar scattering, optical depth, and time variability. We find that no existing VLBI arrays are expected to detect the jet in these best-bet models, consistent with observations to-date. We show that next-generation VLBI arrays at 86 and 115 GHz -- in particular, the EHT after upgrades through the ngEHT program and the ngVLA -- successfully capture the jet in our tests due to improvements in instrument sensitivity and (u,v) coverage at spatial scales critical to jet detection. These results highlight the potential of enhanced VLBI capabilities in the coming decade to reveal the crucial properties of Sgr A* and its interaction with the Galactic Center environment.</description>

      <title>Performance of the HAWC Observatory and TeV Gamma-Ray Measurements of the Crab Nebula with Improved Extensive Air Shower Reconstruction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive-air-shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1~TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, $\mathcal{O}(0.1^{\circ})$ biases in highly inclined showers, as well as enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles ($&gt; 37^{\circ}$) has improved by a factor of four at the highest energies ($&gt; 70$~TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones, based on the resulting $\chi^{2}$ values, improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of four compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources ($E^{-2.63}$) with locations overhead to 30$^{\circ}$ zenith is comparable or less than 10\% of the Crab Nebula's flux between 2 and 50~TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Astrosat view of GX 339-4 during the peak of the recent outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectral and timing analyses of \textit{AstroSat} observations of the Black Hole X-ray Binary GX 339-4 when the source was close the peak of the outburst in 2024. We find that both the spectral and timing variability of the source is indicative of it in its steep power law (SPL) state during the observations. We used phenomenological and physical models to understand the physics and geometry of accretion during this spectral state of the source. Spectral fits indicate the presence of an accretion disc with a temperature of $kT\sim$0.82 keV and a hot corona with a spectral index of $\sim$2.2 along with a significant contribution from iron line emission from the accretion disc. Strong QPOs were detected at $\sim$4.6 Hz in the Power Density Spectra of the source along with a harmonics feature. Time and phase lag at the QPO frequency are studied and we find a hard lag at the QPO frequency and at the same time a soft lag at the harmonic frequency. We estimate the spin of the black hole and it was found that $a = 0.99 \pm 0.003$. The height of the coronal region is estimated to be about 2.5 $R_{g}$, which is found to be similar to that observed during the previous outbursts of the source. We attempt to discuss the possible physical scenario for the observed spectral and timing features exhibited by the source.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Emission of Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Phase. I. Time-resolved and Time-integrated Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-integrated polarization degree (PD) at prompt optical band of gamma-ray burst (GRB) was predicted to be less than $20\%$, while the time-resolved one can reach as high as $75\%$ in photosphere model. Polarizations in optical band during GRB prompt phase had not been studied under framework of the magnetic reconnection model. Here, a three-segment power laws of the energy spectrum is used to reconstruct the Stokes parameters of the magnetic reconnection model. The multi-wavelength light curves and polarization curves from the optical band to MeV gamma-rays in GRB prompt phase are studied. We found depending mainly on the jet dynamics there is a long lasting high PD phase at all calculated energy bands for the typical parameter sets. The time-resolved PD could be as high as $50\%$, while the time-integrated one is roughly $17\%$) in optical band. It can reach $60\%$ for the time-resolved PD in X-rays and the time-integrated one is around $(30-40)\%$. The polarization angle (PA) evolution is random in both optical and gamma-ray bands for the photosphere model, while it is roughly a constant in the synchrotron models. Therefore, future time-resolved PA observations in the prompt optical or gamma-ray band could distinguish between the photosphere and the synchrotron models.</description>

      <title>Birth and Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts: Strong Population-Based Evidence for a Neutron-Star Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the appeal of their extraordinary radio luminosity to our curiosity is undiminished, the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has remained unclear. The challenge has been due in part to small sample sizes and limited understanding of telescope selection effects. We here present the first inclusion of the entire set of one-off FRBs from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 in frbpoppy. Where previous work had to curate this data set, and fit for few model parameters, we have developed full multi-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) capabilities for frbpoppy -- the comprehensive, open-science FRB population synthesis code -- that allow us to include all one-off CHIME bursts. Through the combination of these two advances we now find the best description of the real, underlying FRB population, with higher confidence than before. We show that $4\pm3\times10^{3}$ one-off FRBs go off every second between Earth and $z$=1; and we provide a mock catalog based on our best model, for straight-forward inclusion in other studies. We investigate CHIME side-lobe detection fractions, and FRB luminosity characteristics, to show that some bright, local FRBs are still being missed. We find strong evidence that FRB birth rates evolve with the star formation rate of the Universe, even with a hint of a short (0.1$-$1 Gyr) delay time. The preferred contribution of the hosts to the FRB dispersion agrees with a progenitor birth location in the host disk. This population-based evidence solidly aligns with magnetar-like burst sources, and we conclude FRBs are emitted by neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- II: population analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. Though the debates on the origin of QPEs have not completely settled down, more and more analyses favor the interpretation that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), one of the major targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. In this work, we extended the EMRI orbital analysis in Paper I arXiv:2401.11190 to all the known QPE sources with more than $6$ flares observed. Among all the analyzed 5 QPE sources, two distinct EMRI populations are identified: 4 EMRIs are of low orbital eccentricity (consistent with 0) which should be born in the wet EMRI formation channel, and 1 mildly eccentric EMRI (with $e= 0.25^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level) is consistent with the predictions of both the dry loss-cone formation channel and the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>Collisionless conduction in a high-beta plasma: a collision operator for whistler turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional, magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability (HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling, supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Advancing Precision Particle Background Estimation for Future X-ray Missions: Correlated Variability between AMS and Chandra/XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present one-day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27-day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27-day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer. temporal structures in the datasets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of $\sim$ 25 days and 23 days in ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014 to 2018. Notably, during the 2016--2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of $\sim$13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of $\sim$ 6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and aftern2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS Survey: The radial distribution of star formation rates in faint X-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with $z&lt;0.3$ detected via the \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Chandra} surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.
  To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used \texttt{CIGALE} to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.
  However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1R$\mathrm{_e}$ and then an enhancement beyond 1R$\mathrm{_e}$, strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies.
  These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes of a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole mergers from Population III star clusters</title>

Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) born from the evolution of Population III (Pop. III) stars are one of the main high-redshift targets for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Their predicted initial mass function and lack of metals make them the ideal progenitors of black holes above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap, i.e. with a mass higher than $\approx{}134$ (241) M$_\odot$ for stars that become (do not become) chemically homogeneous during their evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of cluster dynamics on the mass function of BBHs born from Pop. III stars, by considering the main uncertainties on Pop. III star mass function, orbital properties of binary systems, star cluster's mass and disruption time. In our dynamical models, at least $\sim$5% and up to 100% BBH mergers in Pop. III star clusters have primary mass $m_1$ above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap. In contrast, only $\lesssim {} 3$% isolated BBH mergers have primary mass above the gap, unless their progenitors evolved as chemically homogeneous stars. The lack of systems with primary and/or secondary mass inside the gap defines a zone of avoidance with sharp boundaries in the primary mass - mass ratio plane. Finally, we estimate the merger rate density of BBHs and, in the most optimistic case, we find a maximum of $\mathcal{R}\approx200\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z\sim15$ for BBHs formed via dynamical capture. For comparison, the merger rate density of isolated Pop. III BBHs is $\mathcal{R}\leq{}10\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, for the same model of Pop. III star formation history.</description>

      <title>Probing superheavy dark matter through lunar radio observations of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos (UHE$\nu$s) can be used as a valuable probe of superheavy dark matter above $\sim 10^9$ GeV, the latter being difficult to probe with collider and direct detection experiments due to the feebly interacting nature. Searching for radio emissions originating from the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the lunar regolith enables us to explore energies beyond $10^{12}$ GeV, which astrophysical accelerators cannot achieve. Taking into account the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the cosmic neutrino background and resulting standard neutrino cascades to calculate the neutrino flux on Earth, we investigate sensitivities of such lunar radio observations to very heavy dark matter. We show that the proposed ultra-long wavelength lunar radio telescope, as well as the existing low-frequency array, can provide the most stringent constraints on decaying or annihilating superheavy dark matter with masses at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The limits are complementary to or even stronger than those from other UHE$\nu$ detectors, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio array and GRAND.</description>

Abstract: We present direct N-body simulations of black-hole-only clusters with up to $2 \cdot 10^4$ compact objects, zero natal spin and no primordial binaries as predicted by various primordial black hole (PBH) Dark Matter models. The clusters' evolution is computed using ${\tt NBODY6\!+\!+GPU}$, including the effects of the tidal field of the galaxy, the kicks of black hole mergers and orbit-averaged energy loss by gravitational radiation of binaries. We investigate clusters with four initial mass distributions, three of which attempt to model a generic PBH scenario using a lognormal mass distribution and a fourth one that can be directly linked to a monochromatic PBH scenario when accretion is considered. More specifically, we dive into the clusters' internal dynamics, describing their expansion and evaporation, along with the resultant binary black hole mergers. We also compare several simulations with and without black hole merger kicks and find modelling implications for the probability of hierarchical mergers.</description>

      <title>Deceleration of kicked objects due to the Galactic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various stellar objects experience a velocity kick at some point in their evolution. These include neutron stars and black holes at their birth or binary systems when one of the two components goes supernova. For most of these objects, the magnitude of the kick and its impact on the object dynamics remains a topic of debate. We investigate how kicks alter the velocity distribution of objects born in the Milky Way disc, both immediately after the kick and at later times, and whether these kicks are encoded in the observed population of Galactic neutron stars. We simulate the Galactic trajectories of point masses on circular orbits in the disc after being perturbed by an isotropic kick, with a Maxwellian distribution of magnitudes with $\sigma=265$ km/s. Then, we simulate the motion of these point masses for $200$ Myr. These trajectories are then evaluated, either for the Milky Way population as a whole or for those passing within two kiloparsecs of the Sun, to get the time evolution of the velocities. During the first $20$ Myr, the bulk velocity of kicked objects becomes temporarily aligned to the cylindrical radius, implying an anisotropy in the velocity orientations. Beyond this age, the velocity distribution shifts toward lower values and settles to a median of $\sim200$ km/s. Around the Sun, the distribution also loses its upper tail, primarily due to unbound objects escaping the Galaxy. We compare this to the velocities of Galactic pulsars and find that pulsars show a similar evolution with characteristic age. The shift of the velocity distribution is due to bound objects spending most of their orbits at larger radii after the kick. They are, therefore, decelerated by the Galactic potential. We find the same deceleration to be predicted for nearby objects and the total population and conclude it is also observed in Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. Each of the relevant reactions of solar and quiescent stellar hydrogen burning is reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite-mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <title>Realistic models of general-relativistic differentially rotating stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-relativistic equilibria of differentially rotating stars are expected in a number of astrophysical scenarios, from core-collapse supernovae to the remnant of binary neutron-star mergers. The latter, in particular, have been the subject of extensive studies where they were modeled with a variety of laws of differential rotation with varying degree of realism. Starting from accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with various equations of state and mass ratios, we establish the time when the merger remnant has reached a quasi-stationary equilibrium and extract in this way realistic profiles of differential rotation. This allows us to explore how well traditional laws reproduce such differential-rotation properties and to derive new laws of differential rotation that better match the numerical data in the low-density Keplerian regions of the remnant. In this way, we have obtained a novel and somewhat surprising result: the dynamical stability line to quasi-radial oscillations computed from the turning-point criterion can have a slope that is not necessarily negative with respect to the central rest-mass density, as previously found with traditional differential-rotation laws. Indeed, for stellar models reproducing well the properties of the merger remnants, the slope is actually positive, thus reflecting remnants with angular momentum at large distances from the rotation axis, and hence with cores having higher central rest-mass densities and slower rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Predictions of a simple parametric model of hierarchical black hole mergers</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of black holes are proposed as a mechanism to explain the observations of binary black holes with component masses between $\sim 50M_{\odot}\hbox{--}130M_{\odot}$ by LIGO/Virgo, often referred to as "upper mass gap". We study the efficiency with which hierarchical mergers can produce higher and higher masses using a simple model of the forward evolution of binary black hole populations in gravitationally bound systems like stellar clusters. The model relies on pairing probability and initial mass functions for the black hole population, along with numerical relativity fitting formulas for the mass, spin, and kick speed of the merger remnant. We carry out an extensive comparison of the predictions of our model with clusterBHBdynamics (cBHBd) model, a fast method for the evolution of star clusters and black holes therein. For this comparison, we consider three different pairing functions of black holes and consider simulations from high- and low-metallicity cluster environments from cBHBd. We find good agreements between our model and the cBHBd results when the pairing probability of binaries depends on both total mass and mass ratio. We also assess the efficiency of hierarchical mergers as a function of merger generation and derive the mass distribution of black holes using our model. We find that the multi-modal features in the observed binary black hole mass spectrum---revealed by the non-parametric population models---can be interpreted by invoking the hierarchical merger scenario in dense, metal-rich, stellar environments. Further, the two subdominant peaks in the GWTC-3 component mass spectrum are consistent with second and third-generation mergers in metal-rich, dense environments. With more binary black hole detections, our model could be used to infer the black hole initial mass function and pairing probability exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected $0.2-13$ TeV emission of GRB 221009A within 2000 s since the trigger. Here we report the detection of a 400 GeV photon, without accompanying prominent low-energy emission, by Fermi Large Area Telescope in this direction with a 0.4 days' delay. Given an intergalactic magnetic field strength of about $4 \times 10^{-17}$ G, which is comparable to limits from TeV blazars, the delayed 400 GeV photon can be explained as the cascade emission of about 10 TeV gamma rays. We estimate the probabilities of the cascade emission that can result in one detectable photon beyond 100 GeV by Fermi Large Area Telescope within $0.3-1$ days is about 2$\%$ whereas it is about 20.5$\%$ within $0.3-250$ days. Our results show that Synchrotron Self-Compton explanation is less favored with probabilities lower by a factor of about $3-30$ than the cascade scenario.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the neutrino flux from different kinds of galactic sources and compare it with the recently diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We find that the flux from these sources may contribute to ~ 20% of the IceCube neutrino flux. Most of the sources selected in this work populate the southern hemisphere, therefore a detector like KM3NeT could help in resolving the sources out of the observed diffused galactic neutrino flux.</description>

Abstract: The f\'eeton is the gauge boson of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory. If the gauge coupling constant is extremely small, it becomes a candidate for dark matter. We show that its decay to a pair of electron and positron explains the observed Galactic 511-keV gamma-ray excess in a consistent manner. This f\'eeton dark matter decays mainly into pairs of neutrino and anti-neutrino. Future low-energy experiments with improved directional capability make it possible to capture those neutrino signals. The seesaw-motivated parameter space predicts a relatively short f\'eeton lifetime comparable to the current cosmological constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time we analyse gravitational-wave strain data using waveforms constructed from strong gravity simulations of cosmic string loops collapsing to Schwarzschild black holes; a previously unconsidered source. Since the expected signal is dominated by a black-hole ringdown, it can mimic the observed gravitational waves from high-mass binary black hole mergers. To illustrate this, we consider GW190521, a short duration gravitational-wave event observed in the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We show that describing this event as a collapsing cosmic string loop is favoured over previous cosmic string analyses by an approximate log Bayes factor of $22$. The binary black hole hypothesis is still preferred, mostly because the cosmic string remnant is non-spinning. It remains an open question whether a spinning remnant could form from loops with angular momentum, but if possible, it would likely bring into contention the binary black hole preference. Finally, we suggest that searches for ringdown-only waveforms would be a viable approach for identifying collapsing cosmic string events and estimating their event rate. This work opens up an important new direction for the cosmic-string and gravitational-wave communities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously search for multi-target Galactic binary gravitational waves in reduced parameter space with LMPSO-CV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative approach to the concurrent exploration of gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries through the development of a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our methodology employs strategic Create Voids (CV) to streamline parameter space, maximizing the identification of local maxima for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic even in the overlapped signals case. Subsequently, a "find-real-$\mathcal{F}$-statistic-analysis", which implements the astrophysical models and properties of $\mathcal{F}$-statistic in parameter space, is conducted to reveal Galactic binary gravitational wave signals within the dataset. Our new approach eliminates inaccuracies associated with signal subtraction contamination, which is a challenge for traditional iterative-subtraction method when addressing low signal-to-noise ratio signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also consider the effect of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we utilize the residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10982 injection sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been eliminated. For the remaining low SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), the LMPSO-CV method efficiently identifies 8995 signals with a 52.3\% detection rate or 3463 signals with a 73.1\% detection rate when the correlation coefficient threshold $R_t$ is set to 0.8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of massive stars (&gt;8 solar masses) with 1-D models and present analytical fits to the masses and binding energies of the convective portions of their envelopes. These fits are given as functions of total mass, metallicity, and surface temperature (used as a proxy for evolutionary phase). They enable the application of the two-stage common envelope formalism (Hirai &amp; Mandel 2022) in rapid binary population synthesis frameworks. We estimate that the degree of orbital hardening following common-envelope ejection spans 6 orders of magnitude and is a very strong function of the accretor mass, and, to a lesser extent, donor evolutionary phase.</description>

Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called "Gaia BHs" and "Gaia NSs", respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $3$ and $21$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

Abstract: The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.</description>
