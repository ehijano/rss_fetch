      <title>An 'Experimental Mathematics' Approach to Stolarsky Interspersions via Automata Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the Stolarsky interspersions (such as the Wythoff array) one more time, this time using tools from automata theory. These tools allow easy verification of many of the published results on these arrays, as well as proofs of new results.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Timed Automata for Real-Time Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new language semantics for real-time concurrency. Its operational models are higher-dimensional timed automata (HDTAs), a generalization of both higher-dimensional automata and timed automata. In real-time concurrent systems, both concurrency of events and timing and duration of events are of interest. Thus, HDTAs combine the non-interleaving concurrency model of higher-dimensional automata with the real-time modeling, using clocks, of timed automata. We define languages of HDTAs as sets of interval-timed pomsets with interfaces.
  We show that language inclusion of HDTAs is undecidable. On the other hand, using a region construction we can show that untimings of HDTA languages have enough regularity so that untimed language inclusion is decidable. On a more practical note, we give new insights on when practical applications, like checking reachability, might benefit from using HDTAs instead of classical timed automata.</description>

      <title>Bisimilarity in fresh-register automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.06411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Register automata are a basic model of computation over infinite alphabets. Fresh-register automata extend register automata with the capability to generate fresh symbols in order to model computational scenarios involving name creation. This paper investigates the complexity of the bisimilarity problem for classes of register and fresh-register automata. We examine all main disciplines that have appeared in the literature: general register assignments; assignments where duplicate register values are disallowed; and assignments without duplicates in which registers cannot be empty. In the general case, we show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete. However, the absence of duplicate values in registers enables us to identify inherent symmetries inside the associated bisimulation relations, which can be used to establish a polynomial bound on the depth of Attacker-winning strategies. Furthermore, they enable a highly succinct representation of the corresponding bisimulations. By exploiting results from group theory and computational group theory, we can then show solvability in PSPACE and NP respectively for the latter two register disciplines. In each case, we find that freshness does not affect the complexity class of the problem. The results allow us to close a complexity gap for language equivalence of deterministic register automata. We show that deterministic language inequivalence for the no-duplicates fragment is NP-complete, which disproves an old conjecture of Sakamoto. Finally, we discover that, unlike in the finite-alphabet case, the addition of pushdown store makes bisimilarity undecidable, even in the case of visibly pushdown storage.</description>

      <title>The Shortest Interesting Binary Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I will show that there exist two binary words (one of length 4 and one of length 6) that play a special role in many different problems in combinatorics on words. They can therefore be considered \textit{the shortest interesting binary words}. My claim is supported by the fact that these two words appear in dozens of papers in combinatorics on words.</description>
