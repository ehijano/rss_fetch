      <title>Multipath Interference Suppression in Indirect Time-of-Flight Imaging via a Novel Compressed Sensing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without requiring any additional hardware changes.</description>

      <title>Coverage Probability and Average Rate Analysis of Hybrid Cellular and Cell-free Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free wireless networks deploy distributed access points (APs) to simultaneously serve user equipments (UEs) across the service region and are regarded as one of the most promising network architectural paradigms. Despite recent advances in the performance analysis and optimization of cellfree wireless networks, it remains an open question whether large-scale deployment of APs in existing wireless networks can cost-effectively achieve communication capacity growth. Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered to be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be incrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid communication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a collaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and the innovative cellfree network. Therefore, hybrid cellular and cell-free networks (HCCNs) emerge as a practical and feasible solution for advancing cell-free network development, and it is worthwhile to further explore its performance limits. This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based hybrid cellular and cell-free network model to analyze the distributions of signal and interference and reveal their mutual coupling. Specifically, in order to benefit the UEs from both the cellular BSs and the cell-free APs, a conjugate beamforming design is employed, and the aggregated signal is analyzed using moment matching. Then, the coverage probability of the hybrid network is characterized by deriving the Laplace transforms and their higher-order derivatives of interference components. Furthermore, the average achievable rate of the hybrid network over channel fading is derived based on the interference coupling analysis.</description>

      <title>Radar and Acoustic Sensor Fusion using a Transformer Encoder for Robust Drone Detection and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing. However, this has also raised critical security concerns such as unauthorized drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoder architecture in fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation in Massive MIMO Systems with Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing~(ODDM) modulation has recently been regarded as a promising technology to provide reliable communications in high-mobility situations. Accurate and low-complexity channel estimation is one of the most critical challenges for massive multiple input multiple output~(MIMO) ODDM systems, mainly due to the extremely large antenna arrays and high-mobility environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper addresses the issue of channel estimation in downlink massive MIMO-ODDM systems and proposes a low-complexity algorithm based on memory approximate message passing~(MAMP) to estimate the channel state information~(CSI). Specifically, we first establish the effective channel model of the massive MIMO-ODDM systems, where the magnitudes of the elements in the equivalent channel vector follow a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. Further, as the number of antennas grows, the elements in the equivalent coefficient matrix tend to become completely random. Leveraging these characteristics, we utilize the MAMP method to determine the gains, delays, and Doppler effects of the multi-path channel, while the channel angles are estimated through the discrete Fourier transform method. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation algorithm approaches the Bayesian optimal results when the number of antennas tends to infinity and improves the channel estimation accuracy by about 30% compared with the existing algorithms in terms of the normalized mean square error.</description>

      <title>Feature Engineering for Wireless Communications and Networking: Concepts, Methodologies, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-enabled wireless communications have attracted tremendous research interest in recent years, particularly with the rise of novel paradigms such as low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Within these systems, feature engineering plays a pivotal role by transforming raw wireless data into structured representations suitable for AI models. Hence, this paper offers a comprehensive investigation of feature engineering techniques in AI-driven wireless communications. Specifically, we begin with a detailed analysis of fundamental principles and methodologies of feature engineering. Next, we present its applications in wireless communication systems, with special emphasis on ISAC networks. Finally, we introduce a generative AI-based framework, which can reconstruct signal feature spectrum under malicious attacks in low-altitude ISAC networks. The case study shows that it can effectively reconstruct the signal spectrum, achieving an average structural similarity index improvement of 4%, thereby supporting downstream sensing and communication applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Dual-Functional LAWN: Control-Aware System Design for Aerodynamics-Aided UAV Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for advancing low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), serving as a critical enabler for next-generation communication systems. This paper investigates the system design for energy-saving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations in dual-functional LAWNs, where a ground base station (GBS) simultaneously wirelessly controls multiple UAV formations and performs sensing tasks. To enhance flight endurance, we exploit the aerodynamic upwash effects and propose a distributed energy-saving formation framework based on the adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm. Specifically, each UAV updates the local position estimate by invoking the LMS algorithm, followed by refining it through cooperative information exchange with neighbors. This enables an optimized aerodynamic structure that minimizes the formation's overall energy consumption. To ensure control stability and fairness, we formulate a maximum linear quadratic regulator (LQR) minimization problem, which is subject to both the available power budget and the required sensing beam pattern gain. To address this non-convex problem, we develop a two-step approach by first deriving a closed-form expression of LQR as a function of arbitrary beamformers. Subsequently, an efficient iterative algorithm that integrates successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is proposed to obtain a sub-optimal dual-functional beamforming solution. Extensive simulation results confirm that the 'V'-shaped formation is the most energy-efficient configuration and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes in improving control performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Joint Channel Estimation and Positioning for Sparse XL-MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover, sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.</description>

      <title>Dependability Theory-based Statistical QoS Provisioning of Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless networks, offering real-time spatial reconfiguration to enhance reliability, throughput, and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, existing studies often overlook the temporal dynamics of channel fading and their implications for mission-critical operations. In this paper, we propose a dependability-theoretic framework for statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning of FAS under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the level-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of an $N$-port FAS over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Leveraging these second-order statistics, we define two key dependability metrics such as mission reliability and mean time-to-first-failure (MTTFF), to quantify the probability of uninterrupted operation over a defined mission duration. We further extend the classical effective capacity (EC) concept to incorporate mission reliability in the FBL regime, yielding a mission EC (mEC). To capture energy efficiency under bursty traffic and latency constraints, we also develop the mission effective energy efficiency (mEEE) metric and formulate its maximization as a non-convex fractional optimization problem. This problem is then solved via a modified Dinkelbach's method with an embedded line search. Extensive simulations uncover critical trade-offs among port count, QoS exponent, signal-to-noise ratio, and mission duration, offering insights for the design of ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) systems.</description>

      <title>DOA Estimation via Optimal Weighted Low-Rank Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs from the restored uniform linear array samples.
  We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation. We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods. Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at low-noise conditions.</description>

      <title>NeuroCLIP: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Method for rTMS-treated Methamphetamine Addiction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.</description>

      <title>Information-Preserving CSI Feedback: Invertible Networks with Endogenous Quantization and Channel Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising so- lution for efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Conventional deep learning-based methods typically rely on a deep autoencoder to compress the CSI, which leads to irre- versible information loss and degrades reconstruction accuracy. This paper introduces InvCSINet, an information-preserving CSI feedback framework based on invertible neural networks (INNs). By leveraging the bijective nature of INNs, the model ensures information-preserving compression and reconstruction with shared model parameters. To address practical challenges such as quantization and channel-induced errors, we endoge- nously integrate an adaptive quantization module, a differentiable bit-channel distortion module and an information compensation module into the INN architecture. This design enables the network to learn and compensate the information loss during CSI compression, quantization, and noisy transmission, thereby preserving the CSI integrity throughout the feedback process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating superior CSI recovery performance and robustness to practical impairments with a lightweight architec- ture.</description>

      <title>Reliability of Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G-Based UAV RC Links in ISM Bands: Uplink Interference Asymmetry Analysis and HARQ Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Command and control of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) is often realized through air-to-ground (A2G) remote control (RC) links that operate in ISM bands. While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC links, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G) technologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major problem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference sources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link quality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air than the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with a larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the asymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first conducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural areas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show that the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to 170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a result of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To investigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with no combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental redundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact of asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three steps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH) throughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical UL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL throughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network for Automated Pediatric Lung Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in children aged &lt;6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and 0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of 0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with movable-antenna (MA) arrays to strengthen security in wireless communication systems. We propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory and the reconfigurable beamforming of the MA array to maximize secrecy energy efficiency, while ensuring reliable communication with legitimate users. By exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom enabled by the MA array, the system can form highly directional beams and deep nulls, thereby significantly improving physical layer security. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior secrecy energy efficiency, attributed to the enhanced spatial flexibility provided by the movable antenna architecture.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Distributed Optical Fiber Vibration Recognition via Extreme Lightweight Model and Cross-Domain Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) systems offer a promising solution for large-scale monitoring and intrusion event recognition. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges: degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.</description>

      <title>RFI and Jamming Detection in Antenna Arrays with an LSTM Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) and malicious jammers are a significant problem in our wireless world. De- tecting RFI or jamming is typically performed with model-based statistical detection or AI-empowered algorithms that use an input baseband data or time-frequency representations like spectrograms. In this work we depart from the previous approaches and we leverage data in antenna array systems. We use Fourier imaging to localize spatially the sources and then deploy a deep LSTM autoencoder that detects RFI and jamming as anomalies. Our results for different power levels of the RFI/jamming sources, and the signal of interest, reveal that our detector offers high performance without needing any pre-existing knowledge regarding the RFI or jamming signal.</description>

      <title>Angle-distance decomposition based on deep learning for active sonar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater target detection using active sonar constitutes a critical research area in marine sciences and engineering. However, traditional signal processing methods face significant challenges in complex underwater environments due to noise, reverberation, and interference. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep learning-based active sonar target detection method that decomposes the detection process into separate angle and distance estimation tasks. Active sonar target detection employs deep learning models to predict target distance and angle, with the final target position determined by integrating these estimates. Limited underwater acoustic data hinders effective model training, but transfer learning and simulation offer practical solutions to this challenge. Experimental results verify that the method achieves effective and robust performance under challenging conditions.</description>

      <title>The micro-Doppler Attack Against AI-based Human Activity Classification from Wireless Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of Human Activity Classification (HAC) systems are based on AI algorithms that use passively collected wireless signals. This paper presents the micro-Doppler attack targeting HAC from wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The attack is executed by inserting artificial variations in a transmitted OFDM waveform to alter its micro-Doppler signature when it reflects off a human target. We investigate two variants of our scheme that manipulate the waveform at different time scales resulting in altered receiver spectrograms. HAC accuracy with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) can be reduced to less than 10%.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Spectral Approach for Radar-Based Heartbeat Estimation via Autocorrelation of Higher Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear signal processing method for accurate radar-based heartbeat interval estimation by exploiting the periodicity of higher-order harmonics inherent in heartbeat signals. Unlike conventional approaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual harmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the spectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and second-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal to suppress noise and accentuate higher-order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than isolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations of the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent summation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the fundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear approach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling robust interbeat interval estimation. Experiments with radar measurements from five participants demonstrate that the proposed method reduces root-mean-square error by 20% and improves the correlation coefficient by 0.20 relative to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>DT-Aided Resource Management in Spectrum Sharing Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) through spectrum sharing have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectral efficiency and meet increasing wireless demand. However, this coexistence introduces significant challenges, including inter-system interference (ISI) and the low Earth orbit satellite (LSat) movements. To capture the actual environment for resource management, we propose a time-varying digital twin (DT)-aided framework for ISTNs incorporating 3D map that enables joint optimization of bandwidth (BW) allocation, traffic steering, and resource allocation, and aims to minimize congestion. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), addressed through a two-phase algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and compressed sensing approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in queue length minimization compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Chirp-Permuted AFDM: A New Degree of Freedom for Next-Generation Versatile Waveform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) - including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or signaling overhead.</description>

      <title>Interference Analysis and Successive Interference Cancellation for Multistatic OFDM-based ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, which use distributed transmitters and receivers, offer enhanced spatial coverage and sensing accuracy compared to stand-alone ISAC configurations. However, these systems face challenges due to interference between co-existing ISAC nodes, especially during simultaneous operation. In this paper, we analyze the impact of this mutual interference arising from the co-existence in a multistatic ISAC scenario, where a mono- and a bistatic ISAC system share the same spectral resources. We first classify differenct types of interference in the power domain. Then, we discuss how the interference can affect both sensing and communications in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and radar image under varied transmit power and RCS configurations through simulations. Along with interfernce analysis, we propose a low-complexity successive interference cancellation method that adaptively cancels either the monostatic reflection or the bistatic line-of-sight signal based on a monostatic radar image signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The proposed framework is evaluated with both simulations and proof-of-concept measurements using an ISAC testbed with a radar echo generator for object emulation. The results have shown that the proposed method reduces BER and improves EVM as well as radar image SINR across a wide range of SINR conditions. These results demonstrate that accurate component-wise cancellation can be achieved with low computational overhead, making the method suitable for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize the energy dynamics of batteryless IoT sensor nodes powered entirely by ambient energy harvesting. The model captures both the energy harvesting and consumption phases, explicitly incorporating power management tasks to enable precise estimation of device behavior across diverse environmental conditions. The proposed model is applicable to a wide range of IoT devices and supports intelligent power management units designed to maximize harvested energy under fluctuating environmental conditions. We validated our model against a prototype batteryless IoT node, conducting experiments under three distinct illumination scenarios. Results show a strong correlation between analytical and measured supercapacitor voltage profiles, confirming the proposed model's accuracy.</description>

      <title>DeltaLLM: A Training-Free Framework Exploiting Temporal Sparsity for Efficient Edge LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length. Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97 on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly integrating with existing inference pipelines.</description>

      <title>LowKeyEMG: Electromyographic typing with a reduced keyset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LowKeyEMG, a real-time human-computer interface that enables efficient text entry using only 7 gesture classes decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). Prior work has attempted full-alphabet decoding from sEMG, but decoding large character sets remains unreliable, especially for individuals with motor impairments. Instead, LowKeyEMG reduces the English alphabet to 4 gesture keys, with 3 more for space and system interaction, to reliably translate simple one-handed gestures into text, leveraging the recurrent transformer-based language model RWKV for efficient computation. In real-time experiments, participants achieved average one-handed keyboardless typing speeds of 23.3 words per minute with LowKeyEMG, and improved gesture efficiency by 17% (relative to typed phrase length). When typing with only 7 keys, LowKeyEMG can achieve 98.2% top-3 word accuracy, demonstrating that this low-key typing paradigm can maintain practical communication rates. Our results have implications for assistive technologies and any interface where input bandwidth is constrained.</description>

      <title>Debunking Optimization Myths in Federated Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learned Belief Propagation for Decoding Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted belief propagation (WBP) for the decoding of linear block codes is considered. In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to the iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to the edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a training dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where the weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants of this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights take values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to search for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder, a small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP decoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate significant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In the first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit error rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static WBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code designed for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code is a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this case, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is decoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The results show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to the neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational complexity and decoding latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From hearing aids to augmented and virtual reality devices, binaural speech enhancement algorithms have been established as state-of-the-art techniques to improve speech intelligibility and listening comfort. In this paper, we present an end-to-end binaural speech enhancement method using a complex recurrent convolutional network with an encoder-decoder architecture and a complex LSTM recurrent block placed between the encoder and decoder. A loss function that focuses on the preservation of spatial information in addition to speech intelligibility improvement and noise reduction is introduced. The network estimates individual complex ratio masks for the left and right-ear channels of a binaural hearing device in the time-frequency domain. We show that, compared to other baseline algorithms, the proposed method significantly improves the estimated speech intelligibility and reduces the noise while preserving the spatial information of the binaural signals in acoustic situations with a single target speaker and isotropic noise of various types.</description>

Abstract: Binaural acoustic source localization is important to human listeners for spatial awareness, communication and safety. In this paper, an end-to-end binaural localization model for speech in noise is presented. A lightweight convolutional recurrent network that localizes sound in the frontal azimuthal plane for noisy reverberant binaural signals is introduced. The model incorporates additive internal ear noise to represent the frequency-dependent hearing threshold of a typical listener. The localization performance of the model is compared with the steered response power algorithm, and the use of the model as a measure of interaural cue preservation for binaural speech enhancement methods is studied. A listening test was performed to compare the performance of the model with human localization of speech in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Prediction-Powered Calibration via Cross-Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions. Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.</description>

      <title>ACCESS-AV: Adaptive Communication-Computation Codesign for Sustainable Autonomous Vehicle Localization in Smart Factories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast 5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30 cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for sustainable smart factory environments.</description>

      <title>ResCap-DBP: A Lightweight Residual-Capsule Network for Accurate DNA-Binding Protein Prediction Using Global ProteinBERT Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2% and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse genomic contexts.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-User Communication in Semantic Domain: Enhanced OMDMA by Shuffle-Based Orthogonalization and Diffusion Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-user interference remains a critical bottleneck in wireless communication systems, particularly in the emerging paradigm of semantic communication (SemCom). Compared to traditional systems, inter-user interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models (DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training overhead.</description>

      <title>UAV-Borne Digital Radar System for Coherent Multistatic SAR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled higher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures that directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for analog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in waveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), which employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node responsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside secondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes capture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink signal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and processed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is employed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system maintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential for multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the system can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper details the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic SAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization errors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed coherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements, demonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based bistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing high-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.</description>

      <title>Precision spectral estimation at sub-Hz frequencies: closed-form posteriors and Bayesian noise projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component - the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities, i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be treated as approximately normally distributed.</description>

      <title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is available.</description>

Abstract: Conducting nonlinear pushover analysis typically demands intricate and resource-intensive computational attempts, and involves a process that is highly iterative and necessary for satisfying design-defined and also requirements of codes in performance-based design. A computer-based technique is presented for reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in this study, incorporating optimization numerical approaches, techniques of optimality criteria and pushover analysis to seismic design automatically the pushover drift performance. The optimal design based on the performance of concrete beams, columns and shear walls in concrete moment frames is presented using the artificial bee colony optimization algorithm. The design is applied to three frames such as a 4-story, an 8-story and a 12-story. These structures are designed to minimize the overall weight while satisfying the levels of performance include Life Safety (L-S), Collapse Prevention (C-P), and Immediate Occupancy (I-O). To achieve this goal, three main steps are performed. In the first step, optimization codes are implemented in MATLAB software, and the OpenSees software is used for nonlinear static analysis of the structure. By solving the optimization problem, several top designs are obtained for each frame and shear wall. Pushover analysis is performed considering the constraints of relative displacement and plastic hinge rotation based on the nonlinear provisions of FEMA356 code to achieve each levels of performance. Following this, convergence, pushover, and drift history curves are plotted for each frame, and selecting the best design for each frame ultimately occurs. The results demonstrate the algorithm's performance is desirable for the structure to achieve selecting the best design and lower weight.</description>

Abstract: We address the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a data-driven approach that leverages deep-learning methods. A primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of the RF Challenge, which is a publicly available, diverse RF signal dataset for data-driven analyses of RF signal problems. Specifically, we adopt a simplified signal model for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. For this signal model, we introduce a set of carefully chosen deep learning architectures, incorporating key domain-informed modifications alongside traditional benchmark solutions to establish baseline performance metrics for this intricate, ubiquitous problem. Through extensive simulations involving eight different signal mixture types, we demonstrate the superior performance (in some cases, by two orders of magnitude) of architectures such as UNet and WaveNet over traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation. Our findings suggest that the data-driven approach can yield scalable solutions, in the sense that the same architectures may be similarly trained and deployed for different types of signals. Moreover, these findings further corroborate the promising potential of deep learning algorithms for enhancing communication systems, particularly via interference mitigation. This work also includes results from an open competition based on the RF Challenge, hosted at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP'24).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) have emerged as significant enablers of social activities, offering low-altitude services such as the transportation of packages, groceries, and medical supplies. Owing to their control mechanisms and ever-changing operational factors, LAENets are inherently more complex and vulnerable to security threats than traditional terrestrial networks. As applications of LAENet continue to expand, the robustness of these systems becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) optimization framework that tackles robustness challenges in LAENets. We conduct a systematic analysis of robustness requirements for LAENets, complemented by a comprehensive review of robust Quality of Service (QoS) metrics from the wireless physical layer perspective. We then investigate existing GenAI-enabled approaches for robustness enhancement. This leads to our proposal of a novel diffusion-based optimization framework with a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-transformer actor network. In the robust beamforming case study, the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by optimizing beamforming under uncertainties, achieving a more than 15% increase over four learning baselines in the worst-case achievable secrecy rate. These findings highlight the significant potential of GenAI in strengthening LAENet robustness.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies an uplink dual-functional sensing and communication system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), whose reflection pattern is optimally configured to trade-off sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) for estimating the azimuth angle of a sensing user is minimized while ensuring the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints for communication users. We show that this problem can be formulated as a novel fractionally constrained fractional programming (FCFP) problem. To deal with this highly nontrivial problem, we extend a quadratic transform technique, originally proposed to handle optimization problems containing fractional structures only in objectives, to the scenario where the constraints also include ratios. First, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is known. Using the quadratic transform, the FCFP problem can be turned into a sequence of subproblems that are convex except for the constant-modulus constraints which can be tackled using a penalty-based approach. To further reduce the computational complexity, we leverage the constant-modulus conditions and propose a novel linear transform. This new transform enables the FCFP problem to be turned into a sequence of linear programming (LP) subproblems, which can be solved with linear complexity in the dimension of reflecting elements. Then, we consider the case where the fading coefficient is unknown. A modified BCRLB is used to make the problem more tractable, and the proposed quadratic transform based algorithm is used to solve the problem. Numerical results unveil nontrivial and effective reflection patterns that can be synthesized by the RIS to facilitate both communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Differential Evolution Algorithm with Neighbor-hood Mutation for DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time. This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at https://github.com/zzb-nice/DOA_multimodel_optimize.</description>

Abstract: The Recursive KalmanNet, recently introduced by the authors, is a recurrent neural network guided by a Kalman filter, capable of estimating the state variables and error covariance of stochastic dynamic systems from noisy measurements, without prior knowledge of the noise characteristics. This paper explores its generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios, where the temporal dynamics of the test measurements differ from those encountered during training.

      <title>DRL-AdaPart: DRL-Driven Adaptive STAR-RIS Partitioning for Fair and Frugal Resource Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for efficient resource utilization of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) elements to ensure fair and high data rates. We introduce a subsurface assignment variable that determines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user and maximizes the sum of the data rates by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and the subsurface assignment variables using an appropriately tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The proposed DRL method is also compared with a Dinkelbach algorithm and the designed hybrid DRL approach. A penalty term is incorporated into the DRL model to enhance resource utilization by intelligently deactivating STAR-RIS elements when not required. The proposed DRL method can achieve fair and high data rates for static and mobile users while ensuring efficient resource utilization through extensive simulations. Using the proposed DRL method, up to 27% and 21% of STAR-RIS elements can be deactivated in static and mobile scenarios, respectively, without affecting performance.</description>

      <title>The Impact of LoRA Adapters on LLMs for Clinical Text Classification Under Computational and Data Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to domain gap, limited data, and stringent hardware constraints. In this study, we evaluate four adapter techniques-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN) - equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for clinical note classification under real-world, resource-constrained conditions. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU (2 GB VRAM, 512 CUDA cores, 1.386 TFLOPS FP32), limiting batch sizes to &lt;8 sequences and maximum sequence length to 256 tokens. Our clinical corpus comprises only 580 000 tokens, several orders of magnitude smaller than standard LLM pre-training datasets. We fine-tuned three biomedical pre-trained LLMs (CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, DrBERT) and two lightweight Transformer models trained from scratch. Results show that 1) adapter structures provide no consistent gains when fine-tuning biomedical LLMs under these constraints, and 2) simpler Transformers, with minimal parameter counts and training times under six hours, outperform adapter-augmented LLMs, which required over 1000 GPU-hours. Among adapters, GRN achieved the best metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 = 0.88). These findings demonstrate that, in low-resource clinical settings with limited data and compute, lightweight Transformers trained from scratch offer a more practical and efficient solution than large LLMs, while GRN remains a viable adapter choice when minimal adaptation is needed.</description>

      <title>A Combined Channel Approach for Decoding Intracranial EEG Signals: Enhancing Accuracy through Spatial Information Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording, characterized by high spatial and temporal resolution and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enables the development of precise brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for neural decoding. However, the invasive nature of the procedure significantly limits the availability of iEEG datasets in terms of both the number of participants and the duration of recorded sessions. To address this limitation, we propose a single-participant machine learning model optimized for decoding iEEG signals. The model employs 18 key features and operates in two modes: best channel and combined channel. The combined channel mode integrates spatial information from multiple brain regions, leading to superior classification performance. Evaluations across three datasets -- Music Reconstruction, Audio Visual, and AJILE12 -- demonstrate that the combined channel mode consistently outperforms the best channel mode across all classifiers. In the best-performing cases, Random Forest achieved an F1 score of 0.81 +/- 0.05 in the Music Reconstruction dataset and 0.82 +/- 0.10 in the Audio Visual dataset, while XGBoost achieved an F1 score of 0.84 +/- 0.08 in the AJILE12 dataset. Furthermore, the analysis of brain region contributions in the combined channel mode revealed that the model identifies relevant brain regions aligned with physiological expectations for each task and effectively combines data from electrodes in these regions to achieve high performance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating spatial information across brain regions to improve task decoding, offering new avenues for advancing BCI systems and neurotechnological applications.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in next-generation wireless communication systems has become a cornerstone for advancing intelligent, adaptive, and scalable networks. This reading report examines key innovations in dynamic spectrum sensing (DSS), beginning with the foundational DeepSense framework, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spectrogram-based analysis for real-time wideband spectrum monitoring. Building on this groundwork, it highlights advancements such as DeepSweep and Wideband Signal Stitching, which address the challenges of scalability, latency, and dataset diversity through parallel processing, semantic segmentation, and robust data augmentation strategies. The report then explores Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN), focusing on AI/ML-driven enhancements for UAV experimentation, digital twin-based optimization, network slicing, and self-healing xApp development. By bridging AI-based DSS methodologies with ORAN's open, vendor-neutral architecture, these studies underscore the potential of software-defined, intelligent infrastructures in enabling efficient, resilient, and self-optimizing networks for 5G/6G ecosystems. Through this synthesis, the report highlights AI's transformative role in shaping the future of wireless communication and autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral band replication (SBR) enables bit-efficient coding by generating high-frequency bands from the low-frequency ones. However, it only utilizes coarse spectral features upon a subband-wise signal replication, limiting adaptability to diverse acoustic signals. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of a deep neural network (DNN)-based generative approach for coding the high-frequency bands, which we call neural spectral band generation (n-SBG). Specifically, we propose a DNN-based encoder-decoder structure to extract and quantize the side information related to the high-frequency components and generate the components given both the side information and the decoded core-band signals. The whole coding pipeline is optimized with generative adversarial criteria to enable the generation of perceptually plausible sound. From experiments using AAC as the core codec, we show that the proposed method achieves a better perceptual quality than HE-AAC-v1 with much less side information.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20\%, 1.28\%, and 8\% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>
