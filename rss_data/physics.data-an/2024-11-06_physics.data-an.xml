      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings on Higher Order Networks with complex topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang et al.~\cite{jiang2011statistical}, utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in Higher Order Networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect trieval of true rankings to one of imperfect trieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of high-energy hadronic jets ('jet tagging') has been a critical benchmark problem for machine learning in particle physics. Jets are ubiquitous at colliders and are complex objects that serve as prototypical examples of collections of particles to be categorized. Over the last decade, machine learning-based classifiers have replaced classical observables as the state of the art in jet tagging. Increasingly complex machine learning models are leading to increasingly more effective tagger performance. Our goal is to address the question of convergence -- are we getting close to the fundamental limit on jet tagging or is there still potential for computational, statistical, and physical insights for further improvements? We address this question using state-of-the-art generative models to create a realistic, synthetic dataset with a known jet tagging optimum. Various state-of-the-art taggers are deployed on this dataset, showing that there is a significant gap between their performance and the optimum. Our dataset and software are made public to provide a benchmark task for future developments in jet tagging and other areas of particle physics.</description>

      <title>High-pass Filter Periodogram: An Improved Power Spectral Density Estimator for Unevenly Sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate time series analysis is essential for studying variable astronomical sources, where detecting periodicities and characterizing power spectral density (PSD) are crucial. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram, commonly used in astronomy for analyzing unevenly sampled time series data, often suffers from noise introduced by irregular sampling. This paper presents a new high-pass filter (HPF) periodogram, a novel implementation designed to mitigate this sampling-induced noise. By applying a frequency-dependent high-pass filter before computing the periodogram, the HPF method enhances the precision of PSD estimates and periodicity detection across a wide range of signal characteristics. Simulations and comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate that the HPF periodogram improves accuracy and reliability under challenging sampling conditions, making it a valuable complementary tool for more robust time series analysis in astronomy and other fields dealing with unevenly sampled data.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Re-Uploads: A Pathway to Improved Quantum Classification Data Re-Uploading Strategies for Improved Quantum Classifier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.</description>
