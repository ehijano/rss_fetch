      <title>Chemotaxis Models with Nonlinear/Porous Medium Diffusion, Consumption, and Logistic source on $\mathbb{R}^N$: I. Global Solvability and Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This series of papers is concerned with the global solvability, boundedness, regularity, and uniqueness of weak solutions to the following parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system with a logistic source and chemical consumption: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t = m\nabla\cdot \left((\eps+u)^{m-1}\nabla u\right) - \chi \nabla \cdot (u \nabla v) + u(a - b u), &amp; \text{ in } (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \\ v_t = \Delta v - uv, &amp; \text{ in } (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $m &gt; 1$ and $\eps \geq 0$. The present paper focuses on the global solvability and boundedness of weak solutions. For general bounded initial data, which may be non-integrable, we prove the existence of global weak solutions that remain uniformly bounded for all times. The proof relies on deriving local $L^p$ estimates that are uniform in time via a new continuity-type argument and obtaining $L^\infty$ bounds using Moser's iteration; all of these estimates are uniform as $\eps\to0$. In part II, we will study the regularity and uniqueness of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Stability of Degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with Harmonic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the well-posedness and stability of degenerate Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a boundary control acting at the degeneracy. First, we establish the well-posedness of the degenerate problem $v_t(x,t)+\imath(x^\alpha v_x(x,t))_x=0, \hbox{ with } x \in (0,1)$, controlled by Dirichlet-Neumann conditions. Then, exponential and polynomial decreasing of the solution are established. This result is optimal and it is obtained using complex analysis method.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer Dynamics Generated by Non-Axisymmetric Tornado-Type Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy cascade in turbulence, first statistically described by Richardson (1922) and Kolmogorov (1941), lacked connection to the underlying fluid dynamics. Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al. (2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained within spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent elementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type flow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals specific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight into the physical mechanisms of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to a class of $p$-Laplacian Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will prove the existence of infinitely many solutions to the following equation by utilizing the variational perturbation method \begin{equation*} -div(A(x,u)|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+\frac{1}{p}A_{t}(x,u)|\nabla u|^{p}+V(x)|u|^{p-2}u=g(x, u), ~~ x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} where $2&lt;p&lt;N$, $V(x)$ represents a coercive potential. It should be emphasized that the multiplicity of solutions is unsuitable to be discussed under the framework of $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$, as the functional corresponding to the above equation does not satisfy the Palais-Smale condition in this space. To this end, we will use the variational perturbation method to construct novel perturbation space and perturbation functional. By relying on the established conclusions regarding the multiplicity of solutions for classical $p$-Laplacian equations, we shall analyze the equation in question. Our result addresses positively the open question from Candela et. al in CVPDE.</description>

      <title>Nonradial normalized solutions for a quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation via dual approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will utilize the dual method to construct multiple nonradial normalized solutions of the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{equation*} -\Delta u-\Delta(|u|^{2})u-\mu u=|u|^{p-2}u, \qquad in \quad \mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} subject to a mass-subcritical constraint. It should be emphasized that the nonradial result of this equation is new. Besides that, when considering the nonradial problem, it is necessary to construct a new workspace to ensure the compactness. Meanwhile, in this paper, we will expand on the method mentioned in TMNA.</description>

      <title>Construction of Exceptional Points in Time-Modulated High-Contrast Elastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially periodic elastic metamaterials, comprising hard inclusions within a soft matrix in $d$-dimensional space ($d\geq 2$), exhibit a rich spectrum of physical phenomena. This paper investigates such a model and presents the following contributions. First, we analyze the system's subwavelength quasi-frequencies under static conditions, establishing their functional dependence on the high-contrast parameter. This analysis enables the determination of the subwavelength quasi-frequency range. Second, for time-modulated structures, we derive a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) within the subwavelength regime. We demonstrate that this ODE system accurately captures the quasi-frequency behavior of the original elastic system. Finally, leveraging the derived ODEs and Floquet's theorem, we construct concrete examples of first-order asymptotic exceptional points (EPs) in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Random Regularity of the Vlasov-Poisson System with Random Initial Inputs in the Quasineutral Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system is widely used in plasma physics and other related fields. In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson system with initial uncertainty in the quasineutral regime. First, we prove the uniform convergence of the Wasserstein distance between the uncertain Vlasov-Poisson system in the quasineutral regime and its quasineutral limit system with random initial inputs. This is achieved by deriving an upper bound for the Wasserstein distance and rigorously estimating each component of this bound. Furthermore, by defining a new norm with respect to the quasineutral parameter and estimating the distribution function as well as the electric field in this norm using a variable substitution, we establish the random regularity of the solutions in the quasineutral regime. This work develops a novel framework for quantifying the propagation of the initial uncertainty of the Vlasov-Poisson system in the quasineutral regime, providing a theoretical basis for designing high-performance numerical algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the study of the semilinear fractional diffusion-wave equation. We provide estimates on the families of linear operators related to the problem in the fractional power scale associated with the Laplace operator. Furthermore, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of local mild solutions and their possible continuation to a maximal interval of existence. We also consider the issue of spatial regularity and continuous dependence with respect to initial data.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ Hardy inequalities with homogeneous weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, we consider measurable functions $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ that satisfy the following weighted Hardy inequality: \begin{equation}\label{abs}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{ g (x/|x|)}{|x|^{p+\alpha}}|u(x)|^p dx \leq C\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{|\nabla u(x)|^p}{|x|^\alpha} dx, \quad\forall\,u\in \mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{equation} for some constant $C&gt;0$. Depending on $N$, $p$, and $\alpha$, we identify suitable function spaces for $g$ so that \eqref{abs} holds. The constant obtained is sharp, in the sense that it is sharp when $g \equiv 1$. Furthermore, we establish the sharp fractional Hardy inequality with homogeneous weights.</description>

      <title>High-friction limit for bipolar Euler-Riesz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bipolar Euler-Riesz system and rigorously justify the high-friction limit of weak solutions towards a bipolar aggregation-diffusion system with Riesz interactions. The analysis is carried out via the relative entropy method in the regime where smooth solutions of the limiting equations exist. This extends previous results on the high-friction limit of bipolar Euler-Poisson systems to a more general class of interactions, and extends the one-species Euler-Riesz case to the bipolar setting.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of weak solutions to nonlocal doubly degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local regularity for nonlocal doubly degenerate parabolic equations. The model equation is
  \begin{equation*}\begin{split} \partial_t(|u|^{q-1}u)+\mathrm{P}.\mathrm{V}.\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x,t)-u(y,t)|^{p-2}(u(x,t)-u(y,t))}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}\,\mathrm{d}y=0, \end{split} \end{equation*} where $0&lt;s&lt;1$, $p&gt;2$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p-1$. Under a parabolic tail condition, we show that any locally bounded and sign-changing solution is locally H\"older continuous. Our proof is based on a nonlocal version of De Giorgi technique and the method of intrinsic scaling.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Algorithm for Multi-Coefficient Inversion in Nonlinear Helmholtz Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a recursive algorithm for multi-coefficient inversion in nonlinear Helmholtz equations with polynomial-type nonlinearities, utilizing the linearized Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as measurement data. To achieve effective recursive decoupling and simultaneous recovery of multiple coefficients, we develop a novel Fourier-based approach that combines the principle of inclusion-exclusion with carefully constructed complex exponential solutions. This methodology not only ensures unique identifiability but also yields progressively increasing stability with enhanced wavenumbers. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's computational efficiency and excellent reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Cauchy Problem for First-order Quasilinear Equations with Non-Lipschitz Source Terms and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the first-order quasilinear equations with non-Lipschitz source terms and the global structures of the multi-dimensional Riemann solutions. For such quasilinear equations with initial data in $L^\infty$, when the source term $g(t, x, u)$ is only right-Lipschitz (not necessarily left-Lipschitz) in $u$, we first prove that the Kruzkov entropy condition is sufficient to guarantee the well-posdeness of entropy solutions. Next, we analyze the structures of global multi-dimensional Riemann solutions for scalar conservation laws with non-Lipschitz source terms, where the Riemann-type initial data consist of two different constant states separated by a smooth hypersurface. More precisely, we construct the global multidimensional Riemann solutions with non-selfsimilar structures, including nonselfsimilar shock waves and nonselfsimilar rarefaction waves, and prove that these two kinds of basic waves can be expressed via the implicit functions of functional equation determined by the initial discontinuity, the flux functions, and the non-Lipschitz source term. Moreover, we discover two new phenomena: (i) such kinds of basic waves can disappear in a finite time and (ii) the new-type rarefaction wave can contain some weak discontinuities in its interior. These behaviors are in stark contrast to the case of the Lipschitz source term, where these two kinds of basic waves persist globally and the rarefaction waves remain smooth in the interior. Finally, we provide two examples to respectively demonstrate the uniqueness of Riemann solutions in the case of the source term being non-Lipschitz from left (necessarily right-Lipschitz), and the non-uniqueness of Riemann solutions in the case of the source term being non-Lipschitz from right.</description>

      <title>Global strong solutions to the $3$D rotating compressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system for large data in the critical $\widehat{L^p}$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider the $3$D compressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system in the rotational framework. Although there is a wealth of literature on the weak solutions to this system, there seem to be no results on the strong solutions. In this paper, we show the unique existence of global solutions for {\it large} initial data in the critical Besov-type spaces based on the Fourier--Lebesgue spaces $\widehat{L^p}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with $2 \leq p &lt; 3$, provided that the rotation speed and the Mach number are sufficiently large and small, respectively. The key ingredient of the proof is to establish the Strichartz-type estimates due to the dispersion caused by the mixture of the rotation and acoustic waves in the Fourier--Lebesgue spaces, and focus on the better structure of dissipation from the Korteweg term and the nonlinear terms of the divergence form in the momentum formulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the three-dimensional gravity-capillary water wave problem involving an irrotational, perfect fluid with gravity and surface tension. We focus on steady waves propagating uniformly in one direction. Assuming constant wave speed and water depth, we analyze the fluid's velocity potential and boundary conditions. Using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP)-I equation as a simplified model, we show that, within a specific parameter range, the problem admits a fully localized solitary-wave solution resemble lump type solutions of the KP-I equation.</description>

      <title>Unstable mode around the 3D boundary layer flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability properties of boundary layer-type shear flows for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of small viscosity $0&lt;\nu\ll 1$. When the streamwise and spanwise velocity profiles are linearly independent near the boundary, we construct an unstable mode that exhibits rapid growth at the rate of $e^{t/\sqrt{\nu}}$. Our results reveal an analytic instability in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations around generic boundary layer profiles. This instability arises from the interplay between spanwise flow and three-dimensional perturbations, and does not occur in purely two-dimensional flows.</description>

      <title>Equivariant stability of vortices in Manton's Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system on the hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study magnetic vortices on the hyperbolic plane for a Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system introduced by Manton. The model can be thought of as the Schr\"odinger analogue of the Abalian-Higgs model. It consists of a system of partial differential equations, where the complex Higgs field $\Phi$ evolves according to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation coupled to an electromagnetic field $A$. We restrict attention to the self-dual (Bogomolny) case under equivariance symmetry. For each $m\geq 1$ we prove the asymptotic stability of the equivariant vortex of degree $m$. The main novelties are unraveling the favorable structure of the equations after a nonlinear Darboux transform, and the analysis of the elliptic operator relating the original and the transformed variables.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time existence and asymptotic behavior of a class of anisotropic capillary Gauss curvature flows. As an application, we provide a flow approach to the existence of smooth solutions to the capillary even $L_p$ Minkowski problem in the Euclidean half-space for all $p \in (-n-1, \infty)$ and capillary $L_p$ Minkowski problem for $p &gt; n+1$.</description>

      <title>Curvature Flow of Networks with Triple Junction Drag and Grain Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a local existence result for a PDE system that describes curvature motion of networks with a dynamic boundary condition known as triple junction drag. This model arises in the study of grain boundary evolution in polycrystalline materials. We demonstrate the possibility of a new type of topological change during the evolution of the network. Moreover, we adopt a dynamic surface tension model that depends on the crystallographic orientations of the grains, which are allowed to rotate. Lastly, we study how the stability of stationary solutions depend on the choice of surface tension.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear problems with critical Sobolev exponent for the Grushin p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following class of quasilinear degenerate elliptic equations with critical nonlinearity \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}-\Delta_{\gamma,p} u= \lambda |u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p_{\gamma}^{*}-2}u &amp; \text{ in } \Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N, \\ u=0 &amp; \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \end{align*} where $\Delta_{\gamma, p}v:=\sum_{i=1}^N X_i(|\nabla_\gamma u|^{p-2}X_i u)$ is the Grushin $p$-Laplace operator, $z:=(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^N$, $N=m+n,$ $m,n \geq 1,$, where $\nabla_\gamma=(X_1, \ldots, X_N)$ is the Grushin gradient, defined as the system of vector fields $X_i=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}, i=1, \ldots, m$, $X_{m+j}=|x|^\gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial y_j}, j=1, \ldots, n$, where $\gamma&gt;0$. Here, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a smooth bounded domain such that $\Omega\cap \{x=0\}\neq \emptyset$, $\lambda&gt;0$, $q \in [p,p_\gamma^*)$, where $p_{\gamma}^{*}=\frac{pN_\gamma}{N_\gamma-p}$ and $N_\gamma=m+(1+\gamma)n$ denotes the homogeneous dimension attached to the Grushin gradient. The results extends to the $p$-case the Brezis-Nirenberg type results in Alves-Gandal-Loiudice-Tyagi [J. Geom. Anal. 2024, 34(2),52]. The main crucial step is to preliminarily establish the existence of the extremals for the involved Sobolev-type inequality \begin{equation*} \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |\nabla_{\gamma} u|^p dz \geq S_{\gamma,p} \left ( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^{p_\gamma^*} dz \right )^{p/p_\gamma^*} \end{equation*} and their qualitative behavior as positive entire solutions to the limit problem \begin{equation*} -\Delta_{\gamma,p} u= u^{p_{\gamma}^{*}-1}\quad \mbox{on}\, \mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} whose study has independent interest.</description>

      <title>The role of the initial distribution in population survival within a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the role of initial conditions in population persistence. Specifically, we consider the reaction-diffusion equation $u_t\,=\,D\,(u^{\nu-1}\,u_x)_x\,+\,a\,u^{\mu}$, with $\mu,\nu&gt;0$, accompanied by hostile boundary conditions and examine two families of one-parametric initial distributions, including homogeneous distributions. The model was previously studied by Colombo and Anteneodo (2018). They determined appropriate habitat sizes $l$ for the survival of a population, whose individuals are initially placed homogeneously within the full habitat domain with a total initial population $n_0$. We show that the survival condition can be naturally formulated in terms of the parameter $Q:=\frac{a}{D}l^{-\mu+\nu+2}n_0^{\mu-\nu}$. Indeed, there exists a critical value $Q_c$ determined by $\mu$, $\nu$ and the initial distribution parameter such that the survival condition can always be written as $Q\geq Q_c$. Notably, from this point of view, one can derive a condition for $Q$ that holds universally for our model under conditional persistence ($\mu\geq\nu$). It applies, in particular, to the case $\mu=\nu+2$, which was not addressed in the previously mentioned work. Nevertheless, in this case $Q=\frac{a}{D}n_0^2$, therefore survival depends solely on the total population, not on the habitat size. We apply a finite-difference scheme to estimate $Q_c$. Conversely, given a population whose evolution is determined by $\mu$, $\nu$, $l$, $n_0$, and the growth and diffusion coefficients $a$ and $D$ (and consequently the value of $Q$) we use the numerical algorithm to estimate the initial distribution to ensure population survival.</description>

      <title>Forward and inverse problems of a semilinear transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study forward and inverse problems for a semilinear radiative transport model where the absorption coefficient depends on the angular average of the transport solution. Our first result is the well-posedness theory for the transport model with general boundary data, which significantly improves previous theories for small boundary data. For the inverse problem of reconstructing the nonlinear absorption coefficient from internal data, we develop stability results for the reconstructions and unify an $L^1$ stability theory for both the diffusion and transport regimes by introducing a weighted norm that penalizes the contribution from the boundary region. The problems studied here are motivated by applications such as photoacoustic imaging of multi-photon absorption of heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and large time behavior of 3D incompressible inhomogeneous magnetohydrodynamic equations in the exterior of a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the vaccum is allowed, if the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to three dimensional incompressible inhomogeneous magnetohydrodynamic equations holds true or not has always been a challenging open problem, even for the magnetofluids with special structures. In this paper, through deeply exploring the internal structure and characteristic of axisymmetric flows, we obtain some new discoveries and give a partial answer to above issue. More precisely, we prove that the axisymmetric magnetofluids flowing in the exterior of a cylinder will definitely admits a unique strong solution that exists globally in time without any compatibility conditions and small assumptions imposed on the initial data. Furthermore, we establish the algebraic decay rates for the time and spatial derivatives of both velocity and magnetic fields. To the best of our knowledge, this result gives the first unique 3D large solution existing globally in time.</description>

      <title>Schwarz-Pick type lemma and Landau type theorem for $\alpha$-harmonic mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold.
  First, we obtain a Schwarz-Pick type lemma for the $\alpha$-harmonic mapping $u=P_{\alpha}[\phi]$,
  where $\phi\in L^{p}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1},\mathbb{R} )$ and $p\in[1,\infty]$.
  We get an explicit form of the sharp function $\mathbf{C}_{\alpha, q}(x)$ in the inequality
  $|\nabla u(x)| \leq \mathbf{C}_{\alpha, q}(x)\|\phi\|_{L^p(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}, \mathbb{ R} )}$.
  Second, we prove a Landau type theorem for $u=P_{\alpha}[\phi]$,
  where $\phi\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1},\mathbb{R}^{n})$.
  These results generalize and extend the corresponding
  results due to Kalaj (Complex Anal. Oper. Theory, 2024) and
  Khalfallah et al. (Mediterr. J. Math.,
  2021).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the propagation of wave packets close to conical intersections with respect to a system of two Schr{\"o}dinger equations presenting a codimension 2 crossing. We focus on the dynamics that occur when the wave packets pass through an area close to the crossing, and our main results provide an explicit formula for the outgoing wave packet in terms of the incoming one, with a complete description of its phase and of the classical trajectories it follows, including a drift.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators with transversally independent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $\partial_tu - \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on the domain $\mathbb R^{n+1}_+\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients are independent of the spatial variable $x_{n+1}$ (which is transversal to the boundary). We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. An analogous result for the Dirichlet problem has been considered earlier by Auscher, Egert and Nystr\"om, however the Regularity problem represents an additional step up in difficulty. In the elliptic case, the analog of the question considered here was resolved for both Dirichlet and Regularity problems by Hofmann, Kenig, Mayboroda and Pipher.
  The main result of this paper complements a recent work of two of the authors with L. Li showing solvability of the parabolic Regularity problem for data in some $L^p$ spaces when the coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (which is a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a mixed wave-plate equation with rotational inertia, fractional damping and memory non-linearity. This research is a non-existence counterpart to a paper by D'Abbicco and Longen, in search of the critical exponent for the global in-time existence of small data solutions to the Cauchy problem for a mixed wave-plate equation, with a rotational inertia and a non-integer dissipation term and a memory-type non-linearity. We employ a modified test function argument to show that there are arbitrarily small initial data for which there are no solutions for the problem in the subcritical case. Additionally, we show non-existence of global solutions in the critical case when the memory exponent is greater than (n-2)/n.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of velocities in pipline flow of blended gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the pipeline flow of blended gas. The flow is governed by a coupled system where for each component we have the isothermal Euler equations with an additional velocity coupling term that couples the velocities of the different components. Our motivation is hydrogen blending in natural gas pipelines, which will play a role in the transition to renewable energies. We show that with suitable boundary conditions the velocities of the gas components synchronize exponentially fast, as long as the $L^2$-norm of the synchronization error is outside of a certain interval where the size of the interval is determined by the order of the interaction terms. This indicates that in some cases for a mixture of $n$ components it is justified to use a drift-flux model where it is assumed that all components flow with the same velocity. The model error in the sense of the weighted L2-norm of the difference between the barycentric velocity and the velocities of the component is bounded above of the order of the reciprocal value of the coupling term.
  For the proofs we use an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function which is based upon the idea of relative energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation derived from a Cucker-Smale model for flocking with noise. There is a known phase transition depending on the noise between a regime with a unique stationary solution which is isotropic (symmetry) and a regime with a continuum of polarized stationary solutions (symmetry breaking). If the value of the noise is larger than the threshold value, the solution of the evolution equation converges to the unique radial stationary solution. This solution is linearly unstable in the symmetry-breaking range, while polarized stationary solutions attract all solutions with sufficiently low entropy. We prove that the convergence measured in a weighted $L^2$ norm occurs with an exponential rate and that the average speed also converges with exponential rate to a unique limit which determines a single polarized stationary solution.</description>

      <title>The High Energy Distribution of Scattering Phase Shifts of Schr\"odinger operators in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a trace formula for the high energy limit of the scattering phase shifts of Schr\"odinger operators with short range real valued potentials in hyperbolic space; it relates the scattering shifts and the geodesic X-ray transform of the potential. This extends a result of Bulger and Pushnitski for Schr\"odinger operators in Euclidean space. As an application, we prove that the high energy limit of the phase shifts uniquely determines radial potentials which are monotone and decay super-exponentially. This extends a result of Levinson for potential perturbations of the Euclidean Laplacian to this special class of potentials in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness for high-dimensional ideal MHD equations via differential inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-uniqueness of solutions to the ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations in any dimension greater than three by proving the existence of infinitely many compactly supported weak solutions. In particular, these solutions fail to conserve the total energy. Our proof relies on the differential inclusion framework tailored to the geometry of ideal MHD system, which enables the simultaneous use of Baire category method and convex integration scheme.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of a Passive Scalar Transported by Locally Supported White Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic perturbations of transport type are a common and widely accepted way of representing turbulent effects in fluid dynamics models. In many known examples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as \emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the topic is the so-called \emph{It\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting Stratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can show that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology, to an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order elliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector. In this work, we deal with a passive scalar model with molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Starting from the results in [Flandoli \emph{et al.}, 2022, \emph{Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent and compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of stratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq models. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the limit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in literature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order elliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from Homogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective diffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in the $\kappa \rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number of vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally, we provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity, discovering a nonlinear behavior for $\kappa \rightarrow 0$, in some regimes.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to the Cahn-Hilliard equation and hyperuniform fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are disordered, correlated systems in which density fluctuations are suppressed at large scales. Such a property generalizes the concept of order in patterns and is relevant across diverse physical systems. We present a numerical characterization of hyperuniform scalar fields that leverages persistent homology. Topological features across different lengths are represented in persistence diagrams, while similarities or differences between patterns are quantified through Wasserstein distances between these diagrams. We apply this framework to numerical solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a canonical model for generating hyperuniform scalar fields. We validate the approach against known features of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, including its scaling properties, convergence to the sharp interface limit, and self-similarity of the solutions. We then generalize the approach by studying Gaussian random fields exhibiting different degrees and classes of hyperuniformity, showing how the proposed approach can be exploited to reconstruct global properties from local topological information. Overall, we show how hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological features in disordered correlated fields. We expect this analysis to be applicable to a wide range of scalar fields, particularly those involving interfaces and free boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider port-Hamiltonian systems from a geometric perspective, where the quantities involved such as state, flows, and efforts evolve in (possibly infinite-dimensional) Banach spaces. The main contribution of this article is the introduction of a weak solution concept. In this framework we show that the derivative of the state naturally lives in a space that, for ordinary evolution equations, plays the role of an extrapolation space. Through examples, we demonstrate that this approach is consistent with the weak solution framework commonly used for partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Crystallization in the Winterbottom shape and sharp fluctuation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address finite crystallization in two dimensions in the presence of a flat crystalline substrate. Particles interact through short-range two- and three-body potentials favoring local square-lattice arrangements. An additional interaction term of relative strength $\beta&gt;0$ couples the particles and the substrate. Our first main result proves crystallization for all $\beta&gt;0$, corresponding to
  the onset of discrete Winterbottom configurations. The proof relies on a stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond graph of minimizing configurations.
  Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\beta\in (0,1)$. We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\beta$ is rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws. As a corollary, we derive a discrete-to-continuum convergence of minimizers towards the Winterbottom equilibrium shape in the large-particle limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a series of results concerning the uniqueness of Kerr-de Sitter as a family of smooth stationary black hole solutions to the nonlinear Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The results only assume smoothness rather than analyticity of the solution in question. The results use a two-sided approach to rigidity, requiring assumptions on both the event horizon and the cosmological horizon (or a neighborhood thereof) to formulate an appropriate unique continuation argument to prove the rigidity of Kerr-de Sitter.</description>

      <title>Second-order multilane traffic flow models: from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses multilane vehicular traffic modelling, focusing on the transition between microscopic (individual vehicle-based) to macroscopic (aggregate flow-based) descriptions. While previous research on multilane traffic has largely focused on first-order models, we derive two new multilane second-order macroscopic models by applying a microscopic-to-macroscopic limit to the multilane Bando-Follow-the-Leader model. The resulting models incorporate lane-changing through source terms in a hyperbolic system of balance laws. We propose several numerical experiments showing that the models can reproduce complex traffic phenomena, including congestion propagation, non-equilibrium effects, and asymmetric lane usage. Leveraging experimental datasets from real-world highways, we further construct lane-specific empirical fundamental diagrams and compare them with their simulated counterparts, showing that our models can faithfully capture critical density values and characteristic lane-dependent patterns, thus offering a robust and generalizable tool for realistic traffic flow analysis</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov limits of scaling-critical reaction-diffusion equations with random initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a large class of scaling-critical reaction-diffusion equations in two spatial dimensions, where the initial data is white noise mollified at scale $\varepsilon^2$ and the reaction term is attenuated by a factor of $(\log\varepsilon^{-1})^{-1}$. We show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the solution converges to the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation, which is Gaussian with standard deviation given by the solution to an ODE. Our result covers the case of the reaction term $f(u)=u^3$, and thus gives a new proof of the limiting behavior for the Allen-Cahn equation discovered in the recent work of Gabriel, Rosati, and Zygouras (Probab. Theory Related Fields 192: 1373-1446, 2025).</description>

      <title>The linearized translator equation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the linearized translator equation $L_\phi u=f$, around entire convex translators $M=\textrm{graph}(\phi)\subset\mathbb{R}^4$, i.e. in the first dimension where the Bernstein property fails. Here, $L_\phi u=\mathrm{div} (a_\phi D u)+ b_\phi\cdot Du$ is a mean curvature type elliptic operator, whose coefficients degenerate as the slope tends to infinity. We derive two fundamental barrier estimates, specifically an upper-lower estimate and an inner-outer estimate, which allow to propagate $L^\infty$-control between different regions. Packaging these and further estimates together we then develop a Fredholm theory for $L_\phi$ between carefully designed weighted function spaces. Combined with Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction we infer that the space $\mathcal{S}$ of noncollapsed translators in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is a finite dimensional analytic variety and that the tip-curvature map $\kappa:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}$ is analytic. Together with the main result from our prior paper (Camb. J. Math. '23) this allows us to complete the classification of noncollapsed translators in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In particular, we conclude that the one-parameter family of translators constructed by Hoffman-Ilmanen-Martin-White is uniquely determined by the smallest principal curvature at the tip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition under which the time marginal of the law of $\mu$-symmetric diffusion process $\mathsf{X}$ in the infinite dimensional configuration space $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is the unique Wasserstein $\mathsf{W}_{2, \mathsf{d}_\mathbf\Upsilon}$ $\mathsf{EVI}$-gradient flow of the relative entropy (a.k.a. Kullback-Leibler divergence) $\mathrm{Ent}_{\mu}$ on the space $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ of probability measures on $\mathbf \Upsilon$. Here, $\mathbf \Upsilon$ is equipped with the $\ell^2$-matching extended distance $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon$ and a Borel probability $\mu$ while $P(\mathbf \Upsilon)$ is endowed with the transportation extended distance $\mathsf W_{2, \mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon}$ with cost $\mathsf d_\mathbf \Upsilon^2$. Our results include the cases $\mu=\mathsf{sine}_2$ and $\mu= \mathsf{Airy}_2$ point processes, where the associated diffusion processes are unlabelled solutions to the infinite-dimensional Dyson-type stochastic differential equations in the bulk and soft-edge limit respectively. As an application, we show that the extended metric measure space $(\mathbf \Upsilon , \mathsf{d}_\mathbf \Upsilon, \mu)$ satisfies the Riemannian curvature-dimension (RCD) condition as well as the distorted Brunn-Minkowski inequality, the HWI inequality and several other functional inequalities. Finally we prove that the time marginal of the law of $\mathsf{X}$ propagates number rigidity and tail triviality.</description>

Abstract: We consider Dirichlet problems for fully nonlinear mixed local-nonlocal non-translation invariant operators. For a bounded $C^2$ domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d,$ let $u\in C(\mathbb{R}^d)$ be a viscosity solution of such Dirichlet problem. We obtain global Lipschitz regularity and fine boundary regularity for $u$ by constructing appropriate sub and supersolutions coupled with a Harnack type inequality. We apply these results to obtain H\"{o}lder regularity of $Du$ up to the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14215v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We capture optimal decay for the Mullins-Sekerka evolution, a nonlocal, parabolic free boundary problem from materials science. Our main result establishes convergence of BV solutions to the planar profile in the physically relevant case of ambient space dimension three. Far from assuming small or well-prepared initial data, we allow for initial interfaces that do not have graph structure and are not connected, hence explicitly including the regime of Ostwald ripening. In terms only of initially finite (not small) excess mass and excess surface energy, we establish that the surface becomes a Lipschitz graph within a fixed timescale (quantitatively estimated) and remains trapped within this setting. To obtain the graph structure, we leverage regularity results from geometric measure theory. At the same time, we extend a duality method previously employed for one-dimensional PDE problems to higher dimensional, nonlocal geometric evolutions. Optimal algebraic decay rates of excess energy, dissipation, and graph height are obtained.</description>

      <title>Construction of smooth chiral finite-time blow-up solutions to Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS), which is an $L^{2}$-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with explicit solitons, self-duality, and pseudo-conformal symmetry. More importantly, this equation is known to be completely integrable in the Hardy space $L_{+}^{2}$ and the solutions in this class are referred to as \emph{chiral} solutions. A rigorous PDE analysis of this equation with complete integrability was recently initiated by G\'erard and Lenzmann.
  Our main result constructs smooth, chiral, and finite energy finite-time blow-up solutions with mass arbitrarily close to that of a soliton, answering the global regularity question for chiral solutions raised by G\'erard and Lenzmann. The blow-up rate obtained for these solutions is different from the pseudo-conformal rate. Our proof also gives a construction of a codimension one set of smooth finite energy initial data (but without addressing chirality) leading to the same blow-up dynamics. Our blow-up construction in the Hardy space might also be contrasted with the global well-posedness of the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS), which is another integrable $L^{2}$-critical Schr\"odinger equation.
  The overall scheme of our proof is the forward construction of blow-up dynamics with modulation analysis. We begin with developing a linear theory for the near-soliton dynamics. We discover a nontrivial conjugation identity, which unveils a surprising connection from the linearized (CM-DNLS) to the 1D free Schr\"odinger equation, which is a crucial ingredient for overcoming the difficulties from the nonlocal nonlinearity. Another principal challenge in this work, the slow decay of the soliton, is overcome by introducing a trick of decomposing solutions depending on topologies, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Helmholtz equation in an angular sector partially covered by a homogeneous layer of small thickness, denoted $\varepsilon$. We propose in this work an asymptotic expansion of the solution with respect to $\varepsilon$ at any order. This is done using matched asymptotic expansion, which consists here in introducing different asymptotic expansions of the solution in three subdomains: the vicinity of the corner, the layer and the rest of the domain. These expansions are linked through matching conditions. The presence of the corner makes these matching conditions delicate to derive because the fields have singular behaviors. Our approach is to reformulate these matching conditions purely algebraically by writing all asymptotic expansions as formal series. By using algebraic calculus we reduce the matching conditions to scalar relations linking the singular behaviors of the fields. These relations have a convolutive structure and involve some coefficients that can be computed analytically. Our asymptotic expansion is justified rigorously with error estimates.</description>

      <title>The spreading of global solutions of chemotaxis systems with logistic source and consumption on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spreading properties of globally defined bounded positive solutions of a chemotaxis system featuring a logistic source and consumption: \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_tu=\Delta u - \chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+ u(a-bu),\quad &amp;(t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \\ &amp;{\tau \partial_tv}=\Delta v-uv,\quad &amp; (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \end{aligned} \right. \] where $u(t,x)$ represents the population density of a biological species, and $v(t,x)$ denotes the density of a chemical substance. Key findings of this study include: (i) the species spreads at least at the speed $c^*=2\sqrt a$ (equalling the speed when $v\equiv 0$), suggesting that the chemical substance does not hinder the spreading; (ii) the chemical substance does not induce infinitely fast spreading of $u$; (iii) the spreading speed remains unaffected under conditions that $v(0,\cdot)$ decays spatially or $0&lt;-\chi\ll 1$ and $\tau=1$. Additionally, our numerical simulations reveal a noteworthy phase transition in $\chi$: for $v(0, \cdot)$ uniformly distributed across space, the spreading speed accelerates only when $\chi$ surpasses a critical positive value.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Minkowski problem associated with the solution to the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian (or Finsler $p$-Laplacian) equation, namely, the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity.

      <title>Small-time local control of a Schr\"odinger equation: a negative and a positive quadratic result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the small-time local controllability (STLC) of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary conditions near its ground state. We focus on the degenerate case where the linearized system is not controllable, necessitating a second-order analysis. We prove two complementary results. The negative result provides a new PDE instance of Sussmann's classical quadratic obstruction, corresponding to a non-vanishing Lie bracket. The positive result appears to be the first to establish STLC at the quadratic order for a physical PDE with a single scalar control.
  Both proofs rely on a Fourier-based approach, which is crucial because the integral kernel of the second-order term lacks the regularity required by standard integration-by-parts arguments. Along the way, we develop tools valid in a more general setting to analyze such quadratic forms. In particular, we prove results that allow for the multiplication of a kernel by a modulation function.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Uniqueness for a Model of Active Particles with Angle-Averaged Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularity and uniqueness of weak solutions of a degenerate parabolic equation, arising as the limit of a stochastic lattice model of self-propelled particles. The angle-average of the solution appears as a coefficient in the diffusive and drift terms, making the equation nonlocal. We prove that, under unrestrictive non-degeneracy assumptions on the initial data, weak solutions are smooth for positive times. Our method rests on deriving a drift-diffusion equation for a particular function of the angle-averaged density and applying De Giorgi's method to show that the original equation is uniformly parabolic for positive times. We employ a Galerkin approximation to justify rigorously the passage from divergence to non-divergence form of the equation, which yields improved estimates by exploiting a cancellation. By imposing stronger constraints on the initial data, we prove the uniqueness of the weak solution, which relies on Duhamel's principle and gradient estimates for the periodic heat kernel to derive $L^\infty$ estimates for the angle-averaged density.</description>

      <title>Convolution estimates for the Boltzmann gain operator with hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new moment-preserving polynomially weighted convolution estimates for the gain operator of the Boltzmann equation with hard potentials, including the critical case of hard-spheres. Our approach relies crucially on a novel cancellation mechanism dealing with the pathological case of energy-absorbing collisions (that is, collisions that accumulate energy to only one of the outgoing particles). This difficulty is specific to hard potentials, and is not present for Maxwell molecules. Our method quantifies the heuristic that, while energy-absorbing collisions occur with non-trivial probability, they are statistically rare, and therefore do not affect the overall averaging behavior of the gain operator. At the technical level, our proof relies solely on tools from kinetic theory, such as geometric identities and angular averaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local behavior of the elements of a specific energy class, called the nonlocal parabolic ($p$-homogenous) De Giorgi class. This class encompasses the nonlinear parabolic counterpart of the seminal work of M. Cozzi (J. Funct. Anal., 2017) and embodies local weak solutions to the fractional heat equation. More precisely, we first carry on analysis of the local boundedness under optimal tail conditions, and then prove several weak Harnack inequalities, measure theoretical propagation lemmas, and a full Harnack inequality for nonnegative members of the aforementioned class. Finally, we present a full proof of the local H\"older continuity, thereby establishing a Liouville-type rigidity property. The results are new even for the linear case, thereby showing that the recent achievements of Kassmann and Weidner (Duke Math. J., 2024) are structural properties, valid regardless of any equation. The techniques and ideas presented in this paper will open the door for further extensions to many natural directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously establish the existence of dark-bright solitons as traveling wave solutions to a one dimensional defocusing Gross-Pitaevskii system, a widely used model for describing mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear optical systems. These solitons are shown to exhibit symmetry and radial monotonicity in modulus, and to propagate at subsonic speed. Our method relies on minimizing an energy functional subject to two constraints: the mass of the bright component and a modified momentum of the dark component. The compactness of minimizing sequences is obtained via a concentration-compactness argument, which requires some novel estimates based on symmetric decreasing rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Stability of viscous shock for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system: outflow and impermeable wall problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time-asymptotic stability of solutions to the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the half space, focusing on the outflow and impermeable wall problems. When the prescribed boundary and far-field conditions form an outgoing viscous shock, we prove that the solution converges to the viscous shock profile, up to a dynamical shift, provided that the initial perturbation and the shock amplitude are sufficiently small. In order to obtain our results, we employ the method of a-contraction with shifts. Although the impermeable wall problem is technically simpler to analyze in Lagrangian mass coordinates, the outflow problem leads to a free boundary in that framework. Therefore, we use Eulerian coordinates to provide a unified approach to both problems. This is the first result on the time-asymptotic stability of viscous shocks for initial-boundary value problems of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system for the outflow and impermeable wall cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a Lipschitz domain, $K$ be a (bounded) ellipsoid centered at the origin and $H$ be the associated Wulff potential. We prove that, $\Omega$ satisfies the following Serrin-type overdetermined system
  $$u \in W^{1,2}(\mathbb R^n), \quad u=0\ \text{ a.e. in }\mathbb R^n\setminus \Omega,\quad \Delta_H u=\mathbf{c}\mathscr{H}^{n-1}|_{\partial^*\Omega} - \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}\,dx,$$
  in the weak sense if and only if $\Omega$ is homothetic to $K$. Here $\Delta_H$ denotes the anisotropic Laplacian associated to $H$, and $\mathscr H^{n-1}$ denotes the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our approach offers an alternative proof to [11] in the case of Lipschitz domains, introducing a novel viewpoint to settle [13, Question 7.1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate for the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations exhibiting near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show, assuming a suitable decay of correlations, the length scale at which homogenization occurs is at most $\exp(C \log^2(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation--and thus the strength of the disorder--after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we derive an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach may be viewed as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, stochastic algorithms have emerged as scalable and efficient tools for solving large-scale ill-posed inverse problems by randomly selecting subsets of equations at each iteration. However, due to the ill-posedness and measurement noise, these methods often suffer from oscillations and semi-convergence behavior, posing challenges in achieving stable and accurate reconstructions. This study proposes a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, the iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) to address nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method tends to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori information of the noise level. We show that the method terminatesinfinitelymanystepsincaseofnoisydataandhasregularizingfeatures. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary control scheme for prescribed-time (PT) stable of flexible string systems via backstepping method, and the dynamics of such systems modeled by Hamilton's principle is described as second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Initially, to construct a boundary controller with PT stabilization capacity, a PT stable hyperbolic PDEs system with time-varying coefficient is chosen as the target system, and a corresponding Volterra integral transform with time-varying kernel function is considered. Then, to identify the boundary controller, the well-posedness of kernel equation is derived by means of successive approximation and mathematical induction, and the upper bound of kernel function is estimated. Furthermore, the inverse transform is proved with the help of a similar process for kernel function. Subsequently, the PT stability of closed-loop system is proved by PT stability of target system and reversible integral transform. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some connections between Kobayashi geometry and the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation. Among the results we obtain through these connections are: $(i)$~a theorem on the continuous extension up to $\partial{D}$ of a proper holomorphic map $F: D\longrightarrow \Omega$ between domains with $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(D) &lt; \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\Omega)$, and $(ii)$~a result that establishes the existence of bounded domains with ``nice'' boundary geometry on which H\"older regularity of the solutions to the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation fails. The first, a result in Kobayashi geometry, relies upon an auxiliary construction that involves solving the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation with H\"older estimates. The second result relies crucially on a bound for the Kobayashi metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Levi flat structures from the perspective of structure sheaves. We employ formal integrability to construct a class of differential complexes, thereby providing a resolution for the structure sheaf of a basic vector bundle. Drawing inspiration from Morse theory and Grauert's convexity, we introduce a notion of convexity that fully exploits Levi flatness, which ensures the global exactness of the differential complex and demonstrates Sobolev regularity in the compact case. As applications, we establish the global solvability of the Treves complex, and derive results on singular cohomology, as well as the extension problem for canonical forms in the elliptic case.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>Sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators and spectral projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators with positive-definite Carleson--Sj\"olin phases and for spectral projectors on smooth, compact Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we obtain sharp $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the aforementioned H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, thereby completing the analysis in the odd-dimensional case. Further applications include $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the Fourier extension operator, $L^p$ estimates for the Bochner--Riesz operator, microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions, and $L^p$ estimates for Hecke--Maass forms on compact $3$-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.</description>
