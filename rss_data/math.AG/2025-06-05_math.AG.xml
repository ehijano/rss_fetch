      <title>The Hesse pencil of plane curves and osculating conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical problem of determining osculating conics and sextactic points for a given algebraic curve. Our focus is on a particular family of plane cubic curves known as the Hesse pencil. By employing classical tools from projective differential geometry, we derive explicit coordinates for these special points. The resulting formulas not only clarify previous approaches but also lead to the construction of new families of free and nearly free curves, extending recent findings the freeness of curves.</description>

      <title>Intersection of two quadrics: modular interpretation and Hitchin morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cotangent bundle $T^*X$ of a smooth intersection $X$ of two quadrics admits a Lagrangian fibration determined by the intrinsic geometry of $X$. We show that this fibration is actually the Hitchin morphism if we endow $X$ with a structure of moduli space of twisted Spin-bundles. This generalises the classical result for threefolds, in which case it recovers the Hitchin fibration for the moduli space of rank two bundles with fixed determinant of odd degree on a curve of genus two.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Analysis for Symbolic Computation: Root Isolation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce beyond-worst-case analysis into symbolic computation. This is an extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics. The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear (expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Norming Sets for Tensor and Polynomial Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the sketching (i.e., randomized dimension reduction) theory for real algebraic varieties and images of polynomial maps, including, e.g., the set of low rank tensors and tensor networks. Through the lens of norming sets, we provide a framework for controlling the sketching dimension for \textit{any} sketch operator used to embed said sets, including sub-Gaussian, fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and tensor structured sketch operators. Leveraging norming set theory, we propose a new sketching method called the median sketch. It embeds such a set $V$ using only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\dim V)$ tensor structured or sparse linear measurements.</description>

      <title>Refinements on higher order Weil-Oesterl\'e bounds via a Serre type argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weil's theorem gives the most standard bound on the number of points of a curve over a finite field. This bound was improved by Ihara and Oesterl\'e for larger genus. Recently, Hallouin and Perret gave a new point of view on these bounds, that can be obtained by solving a sequence of semi-definite programs, and the two first steps of this hierarchy recover Weil's and Ihara's bounds. On the other hand, by taking into account arithmetic constraints, Serre obtained a refinement on Weil's bound. In this article, we combine these two approaches and propose a strengthening of Ihara's bound, based on an argument similar to Serre's refinement. We show that this generically improves upon Ihara's bound, even in the range where it was the best bound so far. Finally we discuss possible extensions to higher order Weil-Oesterl\'e bounds.</description>

Abstract: I consider Higgs bundles satisfying a notion of ampleness that was introduce Bruzzo, Gra\~na Otero and Hern\'andez Ruip\'erez, and prove that the Chern classes of rank $r$ H-ample Higgs bundles over dimension $n$, polarized, smooth, complex, projective varieties are positive under opportune hypothesis. I extend this to non-negativeness of Chern classes of all numerically effective Higgs bundles; and use this condition to prove the vanishing of Chern classes of numerically flat Higgs bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05492v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attach two binary codes to a projective nodal surface (the strict code K and, for even degree d, the extended code K' ) to investigate the `Nodal Severi varieties F(d, n) of nodal surfaces in P^3 of degree d and with n nodes, and their incidence hierarchy, relating partial smoothings to code shortenings. Our first main result solves a question which dates back over 100 years: the irreducible components of F(4, n) are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of their extended codes K', and these are exactly all the 34 possible shortenings of the extended Kummer code K' , and a component is in the closure of another if and only if the code of the latter is a shortening of the code of the former. We extend this result classifying the irreducible components of all nodal K3 surfaces in the same way, and we fully classify their extended codes. In this classification there are some sporadic cases, obtain through projection from a node.
  For surfaces of degree d=5 in P^3 we determine (with one possible exception) all the possible codes K, and for several cases of K, we show the irreducibility of the corresponding open set of F(5, n), for instance we show the irreducibility of the family of Togliatti quintic surfaces. In the fourth part we show that a `Togliatti-like' description holds for surfaces of degree 6 with the maximum number of nodes= 65: they are discriminants of cubic hypersurfaces in P^6 with 31 (respectively 32) nodes, and we have an irreducible 18-dimensional family of them. For degree d=6, our main result is based on some novel auxiliary results: 1) the study of the half-even sets of nodes on sextic surfaces, 2) the investigation of discriminants of cubic hypersurfaces X, 3) the computer assisted proof that, for n = 65, both codes K, K' are uniquely determined, 4) the description of these codes, relating the geometry of the Barth sextic with the Doro-Hall graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth projective complex curve inside a smooth projective surface, one can ask how its Hodge structure varies when the curve moves inside the surface. In this paper we develop a general theory to study the infinitesimal version of this question in the case of ample curves. We can then apply the machinery to show that the infinitesimal variation of Hodge structure of a general deformation of an ample curve in $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ is an isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\colon S\to B$ a complex fibred surface with fibres of genus $g\geq 2$. Let $u_f$ be its unitary rank, i.e., the rank of the maximal unitary summand of the Hodge bundle $f_*\omega_f$. We prove many new slope inequalities involving $u_f$ and some other invariants of the fibration. As applications:
  (1) we prove a new Xiao-type bound on $u_f$ with respect to $g$ for non-isotrivial fibrations: \[ u_f&lt; g\frac{5g-2}{6g-3}. \] In particular this implies that if $f$ is not locally trivial and $u_f=g-1$ is maximal, then $g\leq 6$;
  (2) we prove a result in the direction of the Coleman-Oort conjecture: a new constraint on the rank of the $(-1,0)$ part of the maximal unitary Higgs subbundle of a curve generically contained in the Torelli locus.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Zhou valuations, originally defined on complex domains, to the framework of general schemes. We demonstrate that an algebraic version of the Jonsson--Musta\c{t}\u{a} conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every Zhou valuation is quasi-monomial. By introducing a mixed version of jumping numbers and Tian functions associated with valuations, we obtain characterizations of a valuation being a Zhou valuation or computing some jumping number using the Tian functions. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between Zhou valuations in algebraic settings and their counterparts in analytic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the classical Hecke correspondences T_N, N&gt;0, act on the free abelian groups generated by the conjugacy classes of the modular group SL_2(Z) and the conjugacy classes of its profinite completion. We show that this action induces a dual action on the ring of class functions of a certain relative unipotent completion of the modular group. This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group. Each Hecke operator preserves this mixed Hodge structure and commutes with the action of the absolute Galois group. Unlike in the classical case, the algebra generated by these Hecke operators is not commutative. The appendix by Pham Tiep is not included. It can be found at arXiv:2303.02807.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Do Enumerative Geometry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can Transformers model and learn enumerative geometry? What is a robust procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based approach to computational enumerative geometry, specifically targeting the computation of $\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection numbers, we explore the enumerative "world-model" of Transformers. Our interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus asymptotic of $\psi$-class intersection numbers. These findings suggest that the network internalizes the parameters of the asymptotic closed-form and the polynomiality phenomenon of intersection numbers in a non-linear manner. This opens up new possibilities in inferring asymptotic closed-form expressions directly from limited amount of data.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use sheaf theory and the six operations to define and study the (equivariant) homology of stacks. The construction makes sense in the algebraic, complex-analytic, or even topological categories.</description>
