      <title>Thermal Emittance Isolation by Cathode Retraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a combination of cathode retraction and two-slit emittance measurement technique is proposed as an advanced means to individually modify emittance growth components, specifically, rf injector fringe fields, to isolate and directly measure the thermal emittance, the fundamental beam emittance metric for an electron beam. A case study of the LCLS-II-HE Low Emittance Injector (LEI), a state-of-the-art superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) gun, designed for LCLS-II HE upgrade is used to showcase the power of the two-slit technique. Particularly, it is demonstrated that generating a high resolution phase-space distribution map, dominated by the intrinsic emittance of the electron bunch, is possible. This result goes beyond the normal single-parameter distribution characterizations (e.g. RMS emittance and Twiss parameters) provided by the solenoid scan. One key feature making this technique work (and in the end practically useful) is the ability to retract the cathode, because it provides the ability to compensate for radiofrequency (rf) de-focusing. It is demonstrated how the cathode retraction can serve as an additional optimisation tool for tailoring the routine performance of the photoinjector. We posit that a variable position cathode may be a useful method for optimizing photoinjector performance across multiple parameters regimes.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Electron Microbunching Rotation for Generating Isolated Attosecond Soft X-ray Free-electron Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond x-ray pulses play a crucial role in the study of ultrafast phenomena occurring within inner and valence electrons. Especially isolated attosecond pulses with high photon energy and high peak power are of great significance in single-shot imaging in the soft x-ray region, life sciences, and attosecond pump-probe experiments. In modern accelerators, laser manipulation of electrons can be used to tailor the ultrafast properties of free-electron laser (FEL) pulses. In this paper, we propose a novel laser manipulation technique that makes use of two laser beams with mutual delays and tilted wavefronts to synthesize microbunching rotation on the scale of infrared laser wavelengths within the electron bunch for generating isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses. This microbunching rotation ultimately leads to an enhanced current contrast ratio between the main peak and the surrounding satellite peaks within the bunch. By properly accounting for the longitudinal space charge fields within the FEL undulator, a tapered undulator can further suppress the side peaks in the radiation pulse and enable the selection of an isolated, hundred-attosecond, GW-level soft x-ray pulse.</description>

      <title>Performance and tolerance study of the rectilinear cooling channel for a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The muon collider has the potential to be a powerful tool for the exploration of frontiers in particle physics. In order to reach high luminosity, the 6D emittance of the muon beam needs to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. The cooling process for a muon collider involves two parts; initial six-dimensional cooling and final transverse cooling. This paper focuses on the former and proposes a conceptual design of the rectilinear cooling channel with additional dipole magnets. In this paper, we first introduce a general method for designing the rectilinear cooling channel. Subsequently, we apply this method to develop two rectilinear cooling channels before and after a bunch merging system. Furthermore, we investigate the impact on cooling performance by employing $\pi$-mode RF cavities and considering the effect of errors in the magnetic and RF fields.</description>
