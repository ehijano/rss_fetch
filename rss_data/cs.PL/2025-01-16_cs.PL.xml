      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to mature, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures. In particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessary support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization are typically not designed for qubit links of wildly varying levels of duration or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a complete and parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum computers, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains up to a 36% increase in circuit fidelity, accompanied by execution time improvements of up to 1.92x. Additionally, owning to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves consistent solve time improvements of 2-4x over a chiplet-aware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Importance of Data Alignment in Downstream Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.</description>

      <title>SYNAPSE: SYmbolic Neural-Aided Preference Synthesis Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to align robot behaviors through learning user specific preferences (e.g. "good pull-over location") from visual demonstrations. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g. "red door"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a novel framework called SYNAPSE, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited data. SYNAPSE represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs, facilitating inspection of individual parts for alignment, in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We perform extensive evaluations on various preferential concepts as well as user case studies demonstrating its ability to align well with dissimilar user preferences. Our method significantly outperforms baselines, especially when it comes to out of distribution generalization. We show the importance of the design choices in the framework through multiple ablation studies.
