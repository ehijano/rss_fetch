      <title>Inference in High-Dimensional Linear Projections: Multi-Horizon Granger Causality and Network Connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Wald test for multi-horizon Granger causality within a high-dimensional sparse Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework. The null hypothesis focuses on the causal coefficients of interest in a local projection (LP) at a given horizon. Nevertheless, the post-double-selection method on LP may not be applicable in this context, as a sparse VAR model does not necessarily imply a sparse LP for horizon h&gt;1. To validate the proposed test, we develop two types of de-biased estimators for the causal coefficients of interest, both relying on first-step machine learning estimators of the VAR slope parameters. The first estimator is derived from the Least Squares method, while the second is obtained through a two-stage approach that offers potential efficiency gains. We further derive heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) inference for each estimator. Additionally, we propose a robust inference method for the two-stage estimator, eliminating the need to correct for serial correlation in the projection residuals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the two-stage estimator with robust inference outperforms the Least Squares method in terms of the Wald test size, particularly for longer projection horizons. We apply our methodology to analyze the interconnectedness of policy-related economic uncertainty among a large set of countries in both the short and long run. Specifically, we construct a causal network to visualize how economic uncertainty spreads across countries over time. Our empirical findings reveal, among other insights, that in the short run (1 and 3 months), the U.S. influences China, while in the long run (9 and 12 months), China influences the U.S. Identifying these connections can help anticipate a country's potential vulnerabilities and propose proactive solutions to mitigate the transmission of economic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Structural Approach to Growth-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the structural impulse responses of quantiles of the outcome variable to a shock. Our estimation strategy explicitly distinguishes treatment from control variables, allowing us to model responses of unconditional quantiles while using controls for identification. Disentangling the effect of adding control variables on identification versus interpretation brings our structural quantile impulse responses conceptually closer to structural mean impulse responses. Applying our methodology to study the impact of financial shocks on lower quantiles of output growth confirms that financial shocks have an outsized effect on growth-at-risk, but the magnitude of our estimates is more extreme than in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Strategic Planning in Master-Planned Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a strategic planning tool for master-planned communities designed specifically to quantify residents' subjective preferences about large investments in amenities and infrastructure projects. Drawing on data obtained from brief online surveys, the tool ranks alternative plans by considering the aggregate anticipated utilization of each proposed amenity and cost sensitivity to it (or risk sensitivity for infrastructure plans). In addition, the tool estimates the percentage of households that favor the preferred plan and predicts whether residents would actually be willing to fund the project. The mathematical underpinnings of the tool are borrowed from utility theory, incorporating exponential functions to model diminishing marginal returns on quality, cost, and risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>Large datasets for the Euro Area and its member countries and the dynamic effects of the common monetary policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and describe a new publicly available large dataset which encompasses quarterly and monthly macroeconomic time series for both the Euro Area (EA) as a whole and its ten primary member countries. The dataset, which is called EA-MD-QD, includes more than 800 time series and spans the period from January 2000 to the latest available month. Since January 2024 EA-MD-QD is updated on a monthly basis and constantly revised, making it an essential resource for conducting policy analysis related to economic outcomes in the EA. To illustrate the usefulness of EA-MD-QD, we study the country specific Impulse Responses of the EA wide monetary policy shock by means of the Common Component VAR plus either Instrumental Variables or Sign Restrictions identification schemes. The results reveal asymmetries in the transmission of the monetary policy shock across countries, particularly between core and peripheral countries. Additionally, we find comovements across Euro Area countries' business cycles to be driven mostly by real variables, compared to nominal ones.</description>

      <title>How to Compare Copula Forecasts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out a principled approach to compare copula forecasts via strictly consistent scores. We first establish the negative result that, in general, copulas fail to be elicitable, implying that copula predictions cannot sensibly be compared on their own. A notable exception is on Fr\'echet classes, that is, when the marginal distribution structure is given and fixed, in which case we give suitable scores for the copula forecast comparison. As a remedy for the general non-elicitability of copulas, we establish novel multi-objective scores for copula forecast along with marginal forecasts. They give rise to two-step tests of equal or superior predictive ability which admit attribution of the forecast ranking to the accuracy of the copulas or the marginals. Simulations show that our two-step tests work well in terms of size and power. We illustrate our new methodology via an empirical example using copula forecasts for international stock market indices.</description>

      <title>Testing for Nonlinear Cointegration under Heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08809v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article discusses Shin (1994, Econometric Theory)-type tests for nonlinear cointegration in the presence of variance breaks. We build on cointegration test approaches under heteroskedasticity (Cavaliere and Taylor, 2006, Journal of Time Series Analysis) and nonlinearity, serial correlation, and endogeneity (Choi and Saikkonen, 2010, Econometric Theory) to propose a bootstrap test and prove its consistency. A Monte Carlo study shows the approach to have satisfactory finite-sample properties in a variety of scenarios. We provide an empirical application to the environmental Kuznets curves (EKC), finding that the cointegration test provides little evidence for the EKC hypothesis. Additionally, we examine a nonlinear relation between the US money demand and the interest rate, finding that our test does not reject the null of a smooth transition cointegrating relation</description>

      <title>Three Scores and 15 Years (1948-2023) of Rao's Score Test: A Brief History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rao (1948) introduced the score test statistic as an alternative to the likelihood ratio and Wald test statistics. In spite of the optimality properties of the score statistic shown in Rao and Poti (1946), the Rao score (RS) test remained unnoticed for almost 20 years. Today, the RS test is part of the ``Holy Trinity'' of hypothesis testing and has found its place in the Statistics and Econometrics textbooks and related software. Reviewing the history of the RS test we note that remarkable test statistics proposed in the literature earlier or around the time of Rao (1948) mostly from intuition, such as Pearson (1900) goodness-fit-test, Moran (1948) I test for spatial dependence and Durbin and Watson (1950) test for serial correlation, can be given RS test statistic interpretation. At the same time, recent developments in the robust hypothesis testing under certain forms of misspecification, make the RS test an active area of research in Statistics and Econometrics. From our brief account of the history the RS test we conclude that its impact in science goes far beyond its calendar starting point with promising future research activities for many years to come.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference for Synthetic Control Methods with Spillover Effects: Estimating the Economic Cost of the Sudan Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) is widely used for causal inference with panel data, particularly when there are few treated units. SCM assumes the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which posits that potential outcomes are unaffected by the treatment status of other units. However, interventions often impact not only treated units but also untreated units, known as spillover effects. This study introduces a novel panel data method that extends SCM to allow for spillover effects and estimate both treatment and spillover effects. This method leverages a spatial autoregressive panel data model to account for spillover effects. We also propose Bayesian inference methods using Bayesian horseshoe priors for regularization. We apply the proposed method to two empirical studies: evaluating the effect of the California tobacco tax on consumption and estimating the economic impact of the 2011 division of Sudan on GDP per capita.</description>

      <title>Multiply Robust Causal Mediation Analysis with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, researchers are interested in the direct and indirect causal effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest. Mediation analysis offers a rigorous framework for identifying and estimating these causal effects. For binary treatments, efficient estimators for the direct and indirect effects are presented by Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012) based on the influence function of the parameter of interest. These estimators possess desirable properties such as multiple-robustness and asymptotic normality while allowing for slower than root-n rates of convergence for the nuisance parameters. However, in settings involving continuous treatments, these influence function-based estimators are not readily applicable without making strong parametric assumptions. In this work, utilizing a kernel-smoothing approach, we propose an estimator suitable for settings with continuous treatments inspired by the influence function-based estimator of Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012). Our proposed approach employs cross-fitting, relaxing the smoothness requirements on the nuisance functions and allowing them to be estimated at slower rates than the target parameter. Additionally, similar to influence function-based estimators, our proposed estimator is multiply robust and asymptotically normal, allowing for inference in settings where parametric assumptions may not be justified.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Tail Index Regression: with An Application to Text Analyses of Viral Posts in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the empirical observation of power-law distributions in the credits (e.g., "likes") of viral social media posts, we introduce a high-dimensional tail index regression model and propose methods for estimation and inference of its parameters. First, we present a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. Second, we introduce a debiasing technique for the regularized estimator to facilitate inference and prove its asymptotic normality. Third, we extend our approach to handle large-scale online streaming data using stochastic gradient descent. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings. We apply these methods to the text analysis of viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) related to LGBTQ+ topics.</description>
