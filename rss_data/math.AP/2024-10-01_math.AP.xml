      <title>Differentiability of monotone maps related to non-quadratic costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost functions considered are $c(x,y)=h(x-y)$, with $h\in C^2(R^n)$, homogeneous of degree $p\geq 2$, with positive definite Hessian in the unit sphere. We consider monotone maps $T$ concerning that cost and establish local $L^\infty$-estimates of $T$ minus affine functions, which are applied to obtain differentiability properties of $T$ a.e. It is also shown that these maps are related to maps of bounded deformation, and further, differentiability and H\"older continuity properties are derived.</description>

Abstract: We study a model describing the motion of the fluid in a lake, assuming inflow-outflow effects across the bottom, the porous coast and the inflows and outflows of rivers.
  We prove the global in time existence result for this model. The solvability is shown in the class of solutions with $L_{p}$-bounded vorticity for any given $p\in (1,\infty]$.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to a class of problems for the Burgers' equation on bounded intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burgers' equation with fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions is considered on generic bounded intervals. By using the Hopf-Cole transformation and the exact operational solution recently established for linear reaction-diffusion equations with constant coefficients, an exact solution in the time domain is implicitly derived by means of inverse Laplace transforms. Analytic inverses, whenever they exist, can be obtained in closed form using Mellin transforms. However, highly efficient algorithms are available, and numerical inverses in the time domain are always possible, regardless of the complexity of the Laplace domain expressions. Two illustration tests show that the results coincide well with those of classical exact solutions. Compared to the solutions obtained with series expressions or by numerical methods, closed-form expressions, even in the Laplace domain, represent an innovative alternative and new perspectives can be envisaged. The exact solution via the inverse Laplace transform is shown to be more computationally efficient and thus provides a reference point for numerical and semi-analytical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an area growth estimate for solutions that are bounded from above of the Liouville equation $\Delta u+K e^{2u}=0$ with a positive pinched curvature $0&lt;\lambda\leq K\leq\Lambda$. As an application, we provide a new proof of Eremenko-Gui-Li-Xu's result in [EGLX]. We also classify solutions with an upper bound in the half plane with the boundary having constant geodesic curvature.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blow-up in fully parabolic quasilinear Keller-Segel systems with supercritical exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the possibility of finite-time blow-up of solutions to the fully parabolic quasilinear Keller--Segel model \begin{align}\tag{$\star$}\label{prob:star}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t = \nabla \cdot ((u+1)^{m-1}\nabla u - u(u+1)^{q-1}\nabla v) &amp; \text{in $\Omega \times (0, T)$}, \\
  v_t = \Delta v - v + u &amp; \text{in $\Omega \times (0, T)$}
  \end{cases} \end{align} in a ball $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq 2$. Previous results show that unbounded solutions exist for all $m, q \in \mathbb R$ with $m-q&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, which, however, are necessarily global in time if $q \leq 0$. It is expected that finite-time blow-up is possible whenever $q &gt; 0$ but in the fully parabolic setting this has so far only been shown when $\max\{m, q\} \geq 1$.
  In the present paper, we substantially extend these findings. Our main results for the two- and three-dimensional settings state that \eqref{prob:star} admits solutions blowing up in finite time if \begin{align*}
  m-q&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  \begin{cases}
  q &lt; 2m &amp; \text{if } n = 2, \\
  q &lt; 2m - \frac23 \text{ or } m &gt; \frac23 &amp; \text{if } n = 3,
  \end{cases} \end{align*} that is, also for certain $m, q$ with $\max\{m, q\} &lt; 1$. As a key new ingredient in our proof, we make use of (singular) pointwise upper estimates for $u$.</description>

      <title>Local Existence for the 2D Euler Equations in a Critical Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Bourgain and Li establish strong ill-posedness of the 2D incompressible Euler equations with vorticity in the critical Sobolev space $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for $sp=2$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$. In this note, we establish short-time existence of solutions with vorticity in the critical space $W^{2,1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Under the additional assumption that the initial vorticity is Dini continuous, we prove that the $W^{2,1}$-regularity of vorticity persists for all time.</description>

      <title>The positivity of the Jacobian in the weak limit of generalised axisymmetric maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(u_j)_j$ be a sequence of maps in $W^{1,2}(\Omega;\mathbb R^3)$, where $\Omega$ is a domain in $\mathbb R^3$. When can we conclude that its weak limit $u$ has non-negative Jacobian a.e.? Hencl and Onninen shows that it is sufficient that each $u_j$ is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism, using an ingenious analysis of a topological invariant called the linking number. Following their approach, we show that if each $u_j$ is a generalised axisymmetric map that has positive Jacobian a.e. and is one-to-one a.e., then $\det Du \ge 0$ a.e. Our proof is based on using the divergence identities to control the sign of the linking numbers of the images of links in $\Omega$ under $u_j$.</description>

      <title>On the optimal rate of vortex stretching for axisymmetric Euler flows without swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For axisymmetric flows without swirl, we prove the upper bound of $t^{4/3}$ for the growth of the vorticity maximum, which was conjectured by Childress [Phys. D, 2008] and supported by numerical computations from Childress--Gilbert--Valiant [J. Fluid Mech. 2016]. The key is to estimate the velocity maximum by the kinetic energy together with conserved quantities involving the vorticity.</description>

      <title>Global BMO-Sobolev Estimates for Second-Order Linear Elliptic Equations on Lipschitz Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \ge 2$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. In this article, we establish first-order global regularity estimates in the scale of BMO spaces on $\Omega$ for weak solutions to the second-order elliptic equation $\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u) = \mathrm{div} , \boldsymbol{f}$ in $\Omega$. This is achieved under minimal regularity assumptions on $\Omega$ and the coefficient matrix $A$, utilizing the pointwise multiplier characterization of the BMO space on $\Omega$. As an application, we also obtain global estimates of $\nabla u$ in the Lebesgue space $L^1(\Omega)$ when $\boldsymbol{f}$ belongs to the Hardy space on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to the three-dimensional two-phase magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of strong solutions to the two-phase magnetohydrodynamic equations in a bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$. The fluids are incompressible, viscous, and resistive. The surface tension is considered. The equations are reformulated using the Hanzawa transformation, which turns the free interface into a fixed one for a short time. The study of the new equations is then divided into the principal part and the nonlinear part. Due to the effect of the magnetic field and the complexity of the transformation in generic bounded domains, the Fr\'echet derivatives of nonlinearities have to be carefully estimated. The equations can then be solved using the fixed-point argument by finding a contraction mapping, which follows the estimates of the nonlinear part.</description>

      <title>A natural requirement for objective corotational rates -- on structure preserving corotational rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate objective corotational rates satisfying an additional, physically plausible assumption. More precisely, we require for \begin{equation*} \frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D} t}[B] = \mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B).D \end{equation*} that $\mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B)$ is positive definite. Here, $B = F \, F^T$ is the left Cauchy-Green tensor, $\frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D}t}$ is a specific objective corotational rate, $D = {\rm sym} \, {\rm D} v$ is the Eulerian stretching and $\mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B)$ is the corresponding induced fourth order tangent stiffness tensor. Well known corotational rates like the Zaremba-Jaumann rate, the Green-Naghdi rate and the logarithmic rate belong to this family of ``positive'' corotational rates. For general objective corotational rates $\frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D} t}$ we determine several conditions characterizing positivity. Among them an explicit condition on the material spin-functions of Xiao, Bruhns and Meyers (2004). We also give a geometrical motivation for invertibility and positivity and highlight the structure preserving properties of corotational rates that distinguish them from more general objective stress rates. Applications of this novel concept are indicated.</description>

      <title>The properties of the solution for the Cauchy problem of a double nonlinear time-dependent parabolic equation in non-divergence form with a source or absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions for a double nonlinear time-dependent parabolic equation with variable density, not in divergence form with a source or absorption. The problem is formulated as a partial differential equation with a nonlinear term that depends on the solution and time. The main results are the existence of weak solutions in suitable function spaces; regularity and positivity of solutions; asymptotic behavior of solutions as time goes to infinity; comparison principles and maximum principles for solutions. The proofs are based on comparison methods and asymptotic techniques. Some examples and applications are also given to illustrate the features of the problem.</description>

      <title>Stability of vortex quadrupoles with odd-odd symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 2D incompressible Euler equations, we establish global-in-time ($t \in \mathbb{R}$) stability of vortex quadrupoles satisfying odd symmetry with respect to both axes. Specifically, if the vorticity restricted to a quadrant is signed, sufficiently concentrated and close to its radial rearrangement up to a translation in $L^1$, we prove that it remains so for all times.
  The main difficulty is that the kinetic energy maximization problem in a quadrant -- the typical approach for establishing vortex stability -- lacks a solution, as the kinetic energy continues to increase when the vorticity escapes to infinity. We overcome this by taking dynamical information into account: finite-time desingularization result is combined with monotonicity of the first moment and a careful analysis of the interaction energies between vortices. The latter is achieved by new pointwise estimates on the Biot--Savart kernel and quantitative stability results for general interaction kernels. Moreover, with a similar strategy we obtain stability of a pair of opposite-signed Lamb dipoles moving away from each other.</description>

      <title>Mixing, Enhanced Dissipation and Phase Transition in the Kinetic Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kinetic Vicsek model, which serves as a starting point for describing the polarization phenomena observed in the experiments of fibroblasts moving on liquid crystalline substrates. The long-time behavior of the kinetic equation is analyzed, revealing that, within specific parameter regimes, the mixing and enhanced dissipation phenomena stabilize the dynamics and ensure effective information communication among agents. Consequently, the solution exhibits features similar to those of a spatially-homogeneous system. As a result, we confirm the phase transition observed in the agent-based Vicsek model at the kinetic level.</description>

Abstract: We consider systems of the form \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} -\Delta u + u = \frac{2p}{p+q}(I_\alpha \ast |v|^{q})|u|^{p-2}u \ \ \textrm{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \\ -\Delta v + v = \frac{2q}{p+q}(I_\alpha \ast |u|^{p})|v|^{q-2}v \ \ \textrm{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{array} \right. \] for $\alpha\in (0, N)$, $\max\left\{\frac{2\alpha}{N}, 1\right\} &lt; p, q &lt; 2^*$ and $\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N} &lt; p+ q &lt; 2^{*}_{\alpha}$, where $I_\alpha$ denotes the Riesz potential, \[ 2^* = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}\frac{2N}{N-2} \ \ \text{for} \ \ N\geq 3,\\ +\infty \ \ \text{for} \ \ N =1,2, \end{array}\right. \quad \text{and} \quad 2^*_{\alpha} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N-2} \ \ \text{for} \ \ N\geq 3,\\ +\infty \ \ \text{for} \ \ N =1,2. \end{array} \right. \] This type of systems arises in the study of standing wave solutions for a certain approximation of the Hartree theory for a two-component attractive interaction. We prove existence and some qualitative properties for ground state solutions, such as definite sign for each component $u$ and $v$, radial symmetry and sharp asymptotic decay at infinity, and a regularity/integrability result for the (weak) solutions. Moreover, we show that the straight lines $p+q=\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N}$ and $ p+ q = 2^{*}_{\alpha}$ are critical for the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>On the energy decay estimate for the dissipative wave equation with very fast oscillating coefficient and smooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider energy decay estimates for the Cauchy problems of dissipative wave equations with time dependent coefficients, in particular, the coefficients consisting of weak dissipation and very fast oscillating terms. For such a problem, which have been difficult to deal with in previous research, we prove energy decay estimates by introducing a new condition for the coefficients to evaluate oscillating cancellation of the energy, and smooth initial data such as in the Gevrey class.</description>

      <title>Global perturbative elliptic problems with critical growth in the fractional setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $s$, $q\in(0,1)$, and a bounded and integrable function $h$ which is strictly positive in an open set, we show that there exist at least two nonnegative solutions $u$ of the critical problem $$(-\Delta)^s u=\varepsilon h(x)u^q+u^{2^*_s-1},$$ as long as $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is sufficiently small.
  Also, if $h$ is nonnegative, these solutions are strictly positive.
  The case $s=1$ was established in [APP00], which highlighted, in the classical case, the importance of combining perturbative techniques with variational methods: indeed, one of the two solutions branches off perturbatively in $\varepsilon$ from $u=0$, while the second solution is found by means of the Mountain Pass Theorem.
  The case $s\in\left(0,\frac12\right]$ was already established, with different methods, in [DMV17] (actually, in [DMV17] it was erroneously believed that the method would have carried through all the fractional cases $s\in(0,1)$, so, in a sense, the results presented here correct and complete the ones in [DMV17]).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $k$-dimensional smooth, compact Riemannian manifold $(N, h)\subset\mathbb R^L$ without boundary, there exists an $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$ such that for any homogeneous of degree zero map $u_0(x)=\phi_0(\frac{x}{|x|}):\mathbb R^n\to N$ ($n\ge 2$), if $\|\nabla\phi_0\|_{L^n(\mathbb S^{n-1})}\le\varepsilon_0$ then there is a unique solution $u:\mathbb R^n\times (0,\infty)\to N$ to the heat flow of harmonic map \eqref{HF1} and \eqref{IC}, which is forward self-similar and belongs to $C^\infty(\R^n\times (0,\infty))\cap C^{\frac1{n}}(\R^n\times [0,\infty)\setminus \{(0,0)\})$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a partial differential equation system on the thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on linear partial differential equation (PDE) systems that arise in topology optimization where the thickness of a structure is constrained. The thickness derived from the PDE is a fictitious one, and the key challenge of this work is to verify its equivalence to the intuitive, geometrically defined thickness. The main difficulty lies in that while intuitive thickness is determined solely by the shape, the thickness defined by the PDE depends not only on the shape but also on the entire domain and the diffusion coefficients used in solving the PDE. In this paper, we demonstrate that the thickness of an infinite, straight film as a simple shape with constant thickness is equivalent within a general domain. The proof involves constructing a reference solution within a special domain and evaluating the difference using the maximum (modulus) principle and an interior $H^1$ estimate. Additionally, we provide an estimate of the dependence of thickness on the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and universal estimates for superlinear parabolic problems without scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Liouville type theorems in the whole space and in a half-space for parabolic problems without scale invariance. To this end, we employ two methods, respectively based on the corresponding elliptic Liouville type theorems and energy estimates for suitably rescaled problems, and on reduction to a scalar equation by proportionality of components.
  We then give applications of known and new Liouville type theorems to universal singularity and decay estimates for non scale invariant parabolic equations and systems involving superlinear nonlinearities with regular variation. To this end, we adapt methods from our preprint arXiv:2407.04154 to parabolic problems.</description>

      <title>Hypo-elasticity, Cauchy-elasticity, corotational stability and monotonicity in the logarithmic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the rate-formulation for the objective, corotational Zaremba-Jaumann rate
  \begin{align}
  \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t} [\sigma] = \mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma).D, \qquad D = {\rm sym} {\rm D} v\,,
  \end{align} operating on the Cauchy stress $\sigma$, the Eulerian strain rate $D$ and the spatial velocity $v$ with the novel \enquote{corotational stability postulate} (CSP)\begin{equation}
  \Bigl\langle \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma], D \Bigr\rangle &gt; 0 \qquad \forall \, D\in{\rm Sym}(3)\setminus\{0\} \end{equation} to show that for a given isotropic Cauchy-elastic constitutive law $B \mapsto \sigma(B)$ in terms of the left Cauchy-Green tensor $B = F F^T$, the induced fourth-order tangent stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma)$ is positive definite if and only if for $\widehat{\sigma}(\log B):=\sigma(B)$, the strong monotonicity condition (TSTS-M$^{++}$) in the logarithmic strain is satisfied. Thus (CSP) implies (TSTS-M^{++}) and vice-versa, and both imply the invertibility of the hypo-elastic material law between the stress and strain rates given by the tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma)$. The same characterization remains true for the corotational Green-Naghdi rate as well as the corotational logarithmic rate, conferring the corotational stability postulate (CSP) together with the monotonicity in the logarithmic strain tensor (TSTS-M^{++}) a far reaching generality. It is conjectured that this characterization of (CSP) holds for a large class of reasonable corotational rates. The result for the logarithmic rate is based on a novel chain rule for corotational derivatives of isotropic tensor functions.</description>

Abstract: We establish new Harnack estimates that defy the waiting-time phenomenon for global solutions to nonlocal parabolic equations. Our technique allows us to consider general nonlocal operators with bounded measurable coefficients. Moreover, we show that a waiting-time is required for the nonlocal parabolic Harnack inequality when local solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion model for a population structured in phenotype and space I -- Criterion for persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reaction-diffusion model for a population structured in phenotype. We assume that the population lives in a heterogeneous periodic environment, so that a given phenotypic trait may be more or less fit according to the spatial location. The model features spatial mobility of individuals as well as mutation.
  We first prove the well-posedness of the model. Next, we derive a criterion for the persistence of the population which involves the generalised principal eigenvalue associated with the linearised elliptic operator. This notion allows us to handle the possible lack of coercivity of the operator. We then obtain a monotonicity result for the generalised principal eigenvalue, in terms of the frequency of spatial fluctuations of the environment and in terms of the spatial diffusivity. We deduce that the more heterogeneous is the environment, or the higher is the mobility of individuals, the harder is the persistence for the species.
  This work lays the mathematical foundation to investigate some other optimisation problems for the environment to make persistence as hard or as easy as possible, which will be addressed in the forthcoming companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal insulation problem of a given domain in $\mathbb R^N$. We study a model of heat trasfer determined by convection; this corresponds, before insulation, to a Robin boundary value problem. We deal with a prototype which involves the first eigenvalue of an elliptic differential operator. Such optimization problem, if the convection heat transfer coefficient is sufficiently large and the total amount of insulation is small enough, presents a symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: The infinitesimal forms of the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for variational functionals, such as the $q$-capacity, torsional rigidity, and the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator, are investigated for $p \geq 0$. These formulations yield Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities related to these functionals. As an application, the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for torsional rigidity with $0 \leq p &lt; 1$ are confirmed for small $C^{2}$-perturbations of the unit ball.</description>

      <title>Control of a Lotka-Volterra System with Weak Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra model reflects real ecological interactions where species compete for limited resources, potentially leading to coexistence, dominance of one species, or extinction of another. Comprehending the mechanisms governing these systems can yield critical insights for developing strategies in ecological management and biodiversity conservation.
  In this work, we investigate the controllability of a Lotka-Volterra system modeling weak competition between two species. Through constrained controls acting on the boundary of the domain, we establish conditions under which the system can be steered towards various target states. More precisely, we show that the system is controllable in finite time towards a state of coexistence whenever it exists, and asymptotically controllable towards single-species states or total extinction, depending on domain size, diffusion, and competition rates. Additionally, we determine scenarios where controllability is not possible and, in these cases, we construct barrier solutions that prevent the system from reaching specific targets. Our results offer critical insights into how competition, diffusion, and spatial domain influence species dynamics under constrained controls. Several numerical experiments complement our analysis, confirming the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem of determining a coefficient $p(x)$ of an evolution equation $\sigma\ppp_tu = a(x)\ppp_x^2u - p(x)u$ for $0&lt;x&lt;\ell$ and $0&lt;t&lt;T$, where $\sigma \in \C \setminus \{0\}$, $\ell&gt;0$ and $T&gt;0$ are arbitrarily given. Our main result is the uniqueness: by assuming that the zeros of initial value $b(x):= u(0,x)$ on $[0, \ell]$ is a finite set and each zero is of order one at most, if two solutions have the same Cauchy data at $x=0$ over $(0,T)$ and the same initial value $b(x)$, then the coefficient $p(x)$ is uniquely determined on $[0,\ell]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a linearized version of the monotonicity method for shape reconstruction using time harmonic elastic waves. The linearized method provides an efficient version of the method, drastically reducing computation time. Here we show that the linearized method has some additional advantages. The linearized method can in particular be used to obtain additional information on the material parameters, and is able to partially separate and identify the supports of the Lam\'e parameters.</description>

      <title>Identification of minimal number of measurements allowing synchronization of a nodal observer for the wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a state estimation problem for a $2\times 2$ linear hyperbolic system on networks with eigenvalues with opposite signs. The system can be seen as a simplified model for gas flow through gas networks. For this system we construct an observer system based on nodal measurements and investigate the convergence of the state of the observer system towards the original system state. We assume that measurements are available at the boundary nodes of the network and identify the minimal number of additional measurements in the network that are needed to guarantee synchronization of the observer state towards the original system state. It turns out that for tree-shaped networks boundary measurements suffice to guarantee exponential synchronization, while for networks that contain cycles synchronization can be guaranteed if and only if at least one measurement point is added in each cycle. This is shown for a system without source term and for a system with linear friction term.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$ Mild Solution to Stochastic Incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global $L^{p}$ mild solution of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the torus $\mathbb{T}^{N}$ with $N&lt;p&lt;6$, $ 1 \leqslant N \leqslant 3$, driven by the Wiener Process. We introduce a new iteration scheme coupled the density $\rho$ and the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ to linearize the system, which defines a semigroup. Notably, unlike semigroups dependent solely on $x$, the generators of this semigroup depend on both time $t$ and space $x$. After demonstrating the properties of this time- and space-dependent semigroup, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of mild solution, employing the semigroup theory and Banach's fixed point theorem. Finally, we show the global existence of mild solutions by Zorn's lemma. Moreover, for the stochastic case, we need to use the operator splitting method to do some estimates separately.</description>

      <title>Global existence and convergence near equilibrium for the moving interface problem between Navier-Stokes and the linear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first establish existence for all positive time near equilibrium for the moving interface problem between the Navier-Stokes equations for the evolving fluid phase (moved by the fluid velocity) and an elastic body modelled by the linear wave equation. This problem has an infinite number of simple solutions with a flat interface (with zero velocity in the fluid, and zero horizontal velocity in the solid), that we call flat interface solutions. We then show that if the initial data is close enough to the canonical equilibrium, the solution converges towards a flat interface solution in large time, showing that these flat interface solutions capture the long time behaviour of this fluid-structure problem near the canonical equilibrium. This result is established with gravity (which can be set to zero or not). It is first established for the case where the solid has initial volume equal to the volume of its reference configuration (where the linear wave equation is naturally written). It is then shown how this applies similarly for the case where the volume of the solid is initially slightly compressed or slightly extended, when compared with the reference configuration.</description>

      <title>Harmonic extension technique: probabilistic and analytic perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a path of the reflected Brownian motion in the half-plane $\{y \ge 0\}$, and erase its part contained in the interior $\{y &gt; 0\}$. What is left is, in an appropriate sense, a path of a jump-type stochastic process on the line $\{y = 0\}$ -- the boundary trace of the reflected Brownian motion. It is well known that this process is in fact the 1-stable L\'evy process, also known as the Cauchy process.
  The PDE interpretation of the above fact is the following. Consider a bounded harmonic function $u$ in the half-plane $\{y &gt; 0\}$, with sufficiently smooth boundary values $f$. Let $g$ denote the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary. The mapping $f \mapsto g$ is known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, and it is again well known that this operator coincides with the square root of the 1-D Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Thus, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator coincides with the generator of the boundary trace process.
  Molchanov and Ostrovskii proved that isotropic stable L\'evy processes are boundary traces of appropriate diffusions in half-spaces. Caffarelli and Silvestre gave a PDE counterpart of this result: the fractional Laplace operator is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an appropriate second-order elliptic equation in the half-space. Again, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator turns out to be the generator of the boundary trace process.
  During my talk I will discuss boundary trace processes and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in a more general context. My main goal will be to explain the connections between probabilistic and analytical results. Along the way, I will introduce the necessary machinery: Brownian local times and additive functionals, Krein's spectral theory of strings, and Fourier transform methods.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for doubly weighted Brownian Motion with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for doubly weighted Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion under curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. We therefor use an interpolation approach based on energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold and the weighted Reilly formula. Along the way we also obtain a lower bound on the first nontrivial doubly weighted Steklov eigenvalue and an upper bound on the norm of the doubly weighted boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions. We also consider the case of weighted Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection.</description>

      <title>A Globalized Inexact Semismooth Newton Method for Nonsmooth Fixed-point Equations involving Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a semismooth Newton framework for the numerical solution of fixed-point equations that are posed in Banach spaces. The framework is motivated by applications in the field of obstacle-type quasi-variational inequalities and implicit obstacle problems. It is discussed in a general functional analytic setting and allows for inexact function evaluations and Newton steps. Moreover, if a certain contraction assumption holds, we show that it is possible to globalize the algorithm by means of the Banach fixed-point theorem and to ensure $q$-superlinear convergence to the problem solution for arbitrary starting values. By means of a localization technique, our Newton method can also be used to determine solutions of fixed-point equations that are only locally contractive and not uniquely solvable. We apply our algorithm to a quasi-variational inequality which arises in thermoforming and which not only involves the obstacle problem as a source of nonsmoothness but also a semilinear PDE containing a nondifferentiable Nemytskii operator. Our analysis is accompanied by numerical experiments that illustrate the mesh-independence and $q$-superlinear convergence of the developed solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Darboux Integrable Elliptic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize real elliptic differential systems whose solutions can be expressed in terms of holomorphic solutions to an associated holomorphic Pfaffian system $\mathcal H$ on a complex manifold. In particular, these elliptic systems arise as quotients by a group $G$ of the real differential system generated by the real and imaginary parts of $\mathcal H$, such that $G$ is the real form of a complex Lie group $K$ which is a symmetry group of $\mathcal H$. Subject to some mild genericity assumptions, we show that such elliptic systems are characterized by a property known as Darboux integrability. Examples discussed include first- and second-order elliptic PDE and PDE systems in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the magnitude function to Brylinski's beta function of a closed manifold. For compact homogeneous spaces, we show that the residues of the beta function contain the same geometric information as the asymptotic expansion of the magnitude function. For general closed manifolds, we use the recent pseudodifferential analysis of the magnitude operator to show how the two relate to each other via an interpolating polynomial family. Beyond manifolds, the relation with the Brylinski beta function allows to deduce unexpected properties of the magnitude function for the $p$-adic integers.</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise: weak solutions and blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive two weak formulations for the one-dimensional supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise on the quarter plane. The first captures a continuously evolving system, while the second resolves blow-ups by allowing for suitable jump discontinuities in the evolution of the temperature profile and the freezing front. For the first formulation, we establish a probabilistic representation in terms of a conditional McKean--Vlasov problem, and we show that there is finite time blow-up with positive probability as soon as part of the initial temperature profile exceeds a critical value. On the other hand, the system evolves continuously according to a unique solution when the initial profile is everywhere below this value. In the presence of blow-ups, we exploit the conditional McKean--Vlasov problem to find probabilistic solutions of the second weak formulation and we show that, among these, there is a particular solution of minimal temperature increase over time. Finally, we characterize the jump discontinuities of this solution as the minimal resolution of instabilities with respect to an infinitesimal external heat transfer. A general uniqueness result remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time Strichartz estimates and cubic Schr\"odinger equation in a conical singular space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:1702.05813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on a metric cone $X$, where $X=C(Y)=(0,\infty)_r\times Y$ and the cross section $Y$ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$. For the metric $g$ on $X$ given by $g=dr^2+r^2h$, let $\Delta_g$ be the positive Friedrichs extension Laplacian on $X$ and $V=V_0 r^{-2}$ where $V_0\in\CC^\infty(Y)$ is a real function such that the operator $P:=\Delta_h+V_0+(n-2)^2/4$ is a strictly positive operator on $L^2(Y)$. We establish the full range of global-in-time Strichartz estimates without loss for the Schr\"odinger equation associated with the operator $\LL_V=\Delta_g+V_0 r^{-2}$ including the endpoint estimate both in homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. A new finding reveals that the range of admissible pairs at $\dot H^s$-level is influenced by the smallest eigenvalue of the operator $P$. This additionally proves the conjecture in Wang [Ann. Inst. Fourier 2006] and generalizes the results of Ford [Comm. Math. Phys. 2010] and Baskin-Marzuola-Wunsch [Contemp. Math. 2014]. As an application, we show the well-posedness theory and scattering theory for the Schr\"odinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity on this setting which verifies a conjecture in Baskin-Marzuola-Wunsch [Contemp. Math. 2014].</description>

Abstract: We mainly consider semilinear thermoelastic plate systems with general power nonlinearities in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$. By applying the Fourier analysis, some sharp $(L^q\cap L^m)-L^q$ estimates of solutions (with any $1\leqslant m\leqslant q\leqslant +\infty$) to the classical thermoelastic plate system are derived, which cover all known results in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then, we investigate global in time existence of small data $L^q$ solutions (with any $q\in[1,+\infty]$) and blow-up of weak solutions for the semilinear thermoelastic plate systems under suitable conditions on the power exponents, which justify critical exponents for several classes of nonlinearities.</description>

This approach extends to time dependent potential perturbations, as it does not rely on Resolvent Estimates or related methods.

      <title>Global existence and optimal time decay rate to one-dimensional two-phase flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and optimal time decay rate of solution to the one dimensional (1D) two-phase flow described by compressible Euler equations coupled with compressible Navier-Stokes equations through the relaxation drag force on the momentum equations. First, we prove the global existence of strong solution to 1D Euler-Navier-Stokes system by using the standard continuity argument for small $H^{1}$ data while the second order derivative can be large. Then we derive the optimal time decay rate to the equilibrium state $(\rho_*, 0, n_*, 0)$. Compared with multi-dimensional case, it is much hard to get time decay rate by direct spectrum method due to a slower convergence rate of the fundamental solution in 1D case. To overcome this main difficulty, we need to first carry out time-weighted energy estimates for higher order derivatives, and based on these time-weighted estimates, we can close a priori assumptions and get the optimal time decay rate by spectrum analysis method. Moreover, due to non-conserved form and insufficient decay rate of the coupled drag force terms between the two-phase flows, we essentially need to use momentum variables $(m= \rho u, M=n\omega)$, not velocity variables $(u, \omega)$ in the spectrum analysis, to fully cancel out those non-conserved and insufficiently decay drag force terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the condenser capacity $\mathrm{cap}_p(E,\Omega)$ on \emph{unbounded} open sets $\Omega$ in a proper connected metric space $X$ equipped with a locally doubling measure supporting a local $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Using a new definition of capacitary potentials, we show that $\mathrm{cap}_p$ is countably subadditive and that it is a Choquet capacity. We next obtain formulas for the capacity of superlevel sets for the capacitary potential. These are then used to show that $p$-harmonic Green functions exist in an unbounded domain $\Omega$ if and only if either $X$ is $p$-hyperbolic or the Sobolev capacity $C_p(X\setminus \Omega)&gt;0$. As an application, we deduce new results for Perron solutions and boundary regularity for the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded open sets.</description>

Abstract: We prove a compactness result related to $G$-convergence for autonomous evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. Compared to previous work related to applications, we do not require any boundedness or regularity of the underlying spatial domain; nor do we assume any periodicity or ergodicity assumption on the potentially oscillatory part. In terms of abstract evolutionary equations, we remove any compactness assumptions of the resolvent modulo kernel of the spatial operator. To achieve the results, we introduced a slightly more general class of material laws. As a by-product, we also provide a criterion for $G$-convergence for time-dependent equations solely in terms of static equations.</description>

      <title>The von Neumann extension theory for abstract Friedrichs operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of abstract Friedrichs operators was introduced some fifteen years ago with the aim of providing a more comprehensive framework for the study of positive symmetric systems of first-order partial differential equations, nowadays better known as (classical) Friedrichs systems. Since then, the theory has not only been frequently applied in numerical and analytical research of Friedrichs systems, but has continued to evolve as well. In this paper, we provide an explicit characterisation and a classification of abstract Friedrichs operators. More precisely, we show that every abstract Friedrichs operator can be written as the sum of a skew-symmetric operator and a bounded self-adjoint strictly positive operator. Furthermore, we develop a classification of realisations of abstract Friedrichs operators in the spirit of the von Neumann extension theory, which, when applied to the symmetric case, extends the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Explicit formula for the Benjamin--Ono equation with square integrable and real valued initial data and applications to the zero dispersion limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend G{\'e}rard's formula for the solution of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to square integrable and real valued initial data. Combined with this formula, we also extend the G{\'e}rard's formula for the zero dispersion limit of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to more singular initial data. In the derivation of the extension of the formula for the zero dispersion limit, we also find an interesting integral equality, which might be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>A PDE Framework of Consensus-Based Optimization for Objectives with Multiple Global Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is an agent-based derivative-free method for non-smooth global optimization that has been introduced in 2017, leveraging a surprising interplay between stochastic exploration and Laplace principle. In addition to its versatility and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems, this approach lends itself well to theoretical analysis. Indeed, its dynamics is governed by a degenerate nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation, whose large time behavior explains the convergence of the method. Recent results provide guarantees of convergence under the restrictive assumption of a unique global minimizer for the objective function. In this work, we propose a novel and simple variation of CBO to tackle non-convex optimization problems with multiple global minimizers. Despite the simplicity of this new model, its analysis is particularly challenging because of its nonlinearity and nonlocal nature. We prove the existence of solutions of the corresponding nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation and we show exponential concentration in time to the set of minimizers made of multiple smooth, convex, and compact components. Our proofs require combining several ingredients, such as delicate geometrical arguments, new variants of a quantitative Laplace principle, ad hoc regularizations and approximations, and regularity theory for parabolic equations. Ultimately, this result suggests that the corresponding CBO algorithm, formulated as an Euler-Maruyama discretization of the underlying empirical stochastic process, tends to converge to multiple global minimizers.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs of existence and stability of solitary waves in the Whitham and capillary-gravity Whitham equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a method to prove constructively the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in both the Whitham and the capillary-gravity Whitham equations. By employing Fourier series analysis and computer-aided techniques, we successfully approximate the Fourier multiplier operator in this equation, allowing the construction of an approximate inverse for the linearization around an approximate solution $u_0$. Then, using a Newton-Kantorovich approach, we provide a sufficient condition under which the existence of a unique solitary wave $\tilde{u}$ in a ball centered at $u_0$ is obtained. The verification of such a condition is established combining analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, we derive a methodology to control the spectrum of the linearization around $\tilde{u}$, enabling the study of spectral stability of the solution. As an illustration, we provide a (constructive) computer-assisted proof of existence of stable {solitary waves} in both the case with capillary effects ($T&gt;0$) and without capillary effects ($T=0$). Moreover, we provide an existence proof for a branch of solitary waves in the case $T=0$ via a rigorous continuation in the wave velocity. The methodology presented in this paper can be generalized and provides a new approach for addressing the existence and spectral stability of solitary waves in nonlocal nonlinear equations. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <title>Refined behavior and structural universality of the blow-up profile for the semilinear heat equation with non scale invariant nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation $$u_t-\Delta u=f(u) $$
  for a large class of non scale invariant nonlinearities of the form
  $f(u)=u^pL(u)$, where $p&gt;1$ is Sobolev subcritical and $L$ is a slowly varying function (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating functions).
  For any positive radial decreasing blow-up solution, we obtain the sharp, global blow-up profile in the scale of the original variables $(x, t)$, which takes the form:
  $$u(x,t)=(1+o(1))\,G^{-1}\bigg(T-t+\frac{p-1}{8p}\frac{|x|^2}{|\log |x||}\bigg),
  \ \hbox{as $(x,t)\to (0,T)$, \quad where } G(X)=\int_{X}^{\infty}\frac{ ds}{f(s)}.$$ This estimate in particular provides the sharp final space profile and the refined space-time profile.
  As a remarkable fact and completely new observation, our results reveal a {\it structural universality} of the global blow-up profile, being given by the "resolvent" $G^{-1}$ of the ODE, composed with a universal, time-space building block, which is the same as in the pure power case.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Riesz transform on exterior Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\ge2$ and $\mathcal{L}=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ be an elliptic operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given an exterior Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, let $\mathcal{L}_D$ be the elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\Omega$ subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition. Previously it was known that the Riesz operator $\nabla \mathcal{L}_D^{-1/2}$ is not bounded for $p&gt;2$ and $p\ge n$, even if $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta$ being the Laplace operator and $\Omega$ being a domain outside a ball. Suppose that $A$ are CMO coefficients or VMO coefficients satisfying certain perturbation property, and $\partial\Omega$ is $C^1$, we prove that for $p&gt;2$ and $p\in [n,\infty)$, it holds $$ \inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})}\left\|\nabla (f-\phi)\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)}\sim \inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})}\left\|\mathcal{L}^{1/2}_D (f-\phi)\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} $$ for $f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. Here $\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})$ is the kernel of $\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2}$ in $\dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$, which coincides with $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}^p_0(\Omega):=\{f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega):\,\mathcal{L}_Df=0\}$ and is a one dimensional subspace. As an application, we provide a substitution of $L^p$-boundedness of $\sqrt{t}\nabla e^{-t\mathcal{L}_D}$ which is uniform in $t$ for $p\ge n$ and $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Method for Particle Approximation of the Landau Equation for Maxwellian Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for Maxwellian molecules from a natural stochastic interacting particle system. More precisely, we control the relative entropy between the joint law of the particle system and the tensorized law of the Landau equation. To obtain this, we establish as key tools the pointwise logarithmic gradient and Hessian estimates of the density function and also a new Law of Large Numbers result for the particle system. The logarithmic estimates are derived via the Bernstein method and the parabolic maximum principle, while the Law of Large Numbers result comes from crucial observations on the control of moments at the particle level.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar Variational Model for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. Moreover, we develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates, we show that the above nonrelativistic limit has the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we also get the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$, this means that $R_\infty-R_c=O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal uniform bounds of $R_c$ and $L^\infty$-norm of $\rho_c$ with respect to $N$ as $c\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the singular set of an $m$-dimensional integral current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n + m}$, semicalibrated by a $C^{2, \kappa_0}$ $m$-form $\omega$ is countably $(m - 2)$-rectifiable. Furthermore, we show that there is a unique tangent cone at $\mathcal{H}^{m - 2}$-a.e. point in the interior singular set of $T$. Our proof adapts techniques that were recently developed in [DLS23a, DLS23b, DLMS23] for area-minimizing currents to this setting.</description>

      <title>It begins with a boundary: A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested into reformulating standard Risk Minimization (RM) into an adversarially robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of RM. In this paper, we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL). We propose a mathematical framework for understanding PRL, which allows us to identify geometric pathologies in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to rectify them. We prove existence of solutions to the original and modified problems using novel relaxation methods and also study properties, as well as local limits, of the introduced perimeters. We also clarify, through a suitable $\Gamma$-convergence analysis, the way in which the original and modified PRL models interpolate between risk minimization and adversarial training.</description>

Abstract: We show that the flow approach of Duch [Duc21] can be adapted to prove local well-posedness for the generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semi-linear equations involving smooth, non-polynomial, functions of the solution - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of elementary differentials.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of stable-like operators with random, ergodic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show homogenization for a family of $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stable-like processes $(X_t^{\epsilon;\theta})_{t\ge 0}$, $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, whose (random) Fourier symbols equal $q_\epsilon(x,\xi;\theta)=\frac{1}{\epsilon^{\alpha}}q(x/\epsilon,\epsilon\xi; \theta)$, where$$q(x,\xi; \theta)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\big(1-e^{i y\cdot\xi}+iy\cdot\xi\mathds{1}_{\{|y|\le1\}}\big)\,\frac{\langle a(x;\theta)y,y\rangle}{|y|^{d+2+\alpha}}\,dy,$$for $(x,\xi,\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}\times\Theta$. Here, $\alpha\in(0,2)$ and the family $(a(x; \theta))_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}$ of $d\times d$ symmetric, non-negative definite matrices is a stationary ergodic random field over some probability space $(\Theta,{\cal H},m)$. We assume that the random field is deterministically bounded and non-degenerate, i.e.\ $|a(x;\theta)|\le\Lambda$ and $\text{Tr}(a(x;\theta))\ge\lambda$ for some $\Lambda,\lambda&gt;0$ and all $\theta\in\Theta$. In addition, we suppose that the field is regular enough so that for any $\theta\in\Theta$, the operator $-q(\cdot,D;\theta)$, defined on the space of compactly supported $C^2$ functions, is closable in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity and its closure generates a Feller semigroup. We prove the weak convergence of the laws of $(X_t^{\epsilon;\theta})_{t\ge 0}$, as $\epsilon\to0^+$, in the Skorokhod space, $m$-a.s.\ in $\theta$, to an $\alpha$-stable process whose Fourier symbol $\bar{q}(\xi)$ is given by $\bar{q}(\xi)=\int_{\Omega}q(0,\xi;\theta)\Phi_*(\theta)\,m(d\theta)$, where $\Phi_*$ is a strictly positive density w.r.t.\ measure $m$. Our result has an analytic interpretation in terms of the convergence, as $\epsilon\to0^+$, of the solutions to random integro-differential equations $ \partial_tu_\epsilon(t,x;\theta)=-q_\epsilon(x,D;\theta)u_\epsilon(t,x;\theta)$, with the initial condition $u_\epsilon(0,x;\theta)=f(x)$, where $f$ is a bounded and continuous function.</description>

      <title>On the inviscid instability of the 2D Taylor-Green vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Euler flows on two-dimensional (2D) periodic domain and are interested in the stability, both linear and nonlinear, of a simple equilibrium given by the 2D Taylor-Green vortex. As the first main result, numerical evidence is provided for the fact that such flows possess unstable eigenvalues embedded in the band of the essential spectrum of the linearized operator. However, the unstable eigenfunction is discontinuous at the hyperbolic stagnation points of the base flow and its regularity is consistent with the prediction of Lin (2004). This eigenfunction gives rise to an exponential transient growth with the rate given by the real part of the eigenvalue followed by passage to a nonlinear instability. As the second main result, we illustrate a fundamentally different, non-modal, growth mechanism involving a continuous family of uncorrelated functions, instead of an eigenfunction of the linearized operator. Constructed by solving a suitable PDE optimization problem, the resulting flows saturate the known estimates on the growth of the semigroup related to the essential spectrum of the linearized Euler operator as the numerical resolution is refined. These findings are contrasted with the results of earlier studies of a similar problem conducted in a slightly viscous setting where only the modal growth of instabilities was observed. This highlights the special stability properties of equilibria in inviscid flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic manifold with complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$. We prove well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with complete Cauchy hypersurfaces. This result is needed as preparation in showing a Fredholmness result in the manner, provided by B\"ar and Strohmaier, for certain non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces in future work. The results already have been published for a simpler setting in arxiv:2107.08532. This version is only focused on the Cauchy problem for a slightly modified setting.</description>
