      <title>Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>

      <title>Using a new spectral disentangling approach to ascertain whether the massive binary HDE 228766 contains a Wolf-Rayet star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive binary HDE 228766 is composed of an O type primary and an evolved secondary. However, previous qualitative analyses of the composite spectrum have led to a wide discussion about whether the secondary is an Of or a Wolf-Rayet star. We use new observations and our novel QER20 package to disentangle for the first time the spectra of the two stellar components and obtain artefact free reconstructed spectra, yielding the more accurate and reliable spectral classifications of O7.5 V((f))z for the primary and O6 Iaf for the secondary. The emission features of the P-Cygni profiles of the H\b{eta} and He I 5876 {\AA} lines, present in the reconstructed spectrum of the secondary, show that this star is at an initial phase of its transition to the WN evolutionary stage. A previously unobserved variable emission, composed of at least four independent features, is seen since 2014 superposed to the H{\gamma} absorption line. Our analysis reveals that these emission features originate from a physically extended region. This could be explained by an episode of enhanced mass-loss in the scenario of a non conservative evolution of the binary.</description>

      <title>Variable Star Light Curves in Koopman Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of data-driven techniques for dynamical system analysis based on Koopman theory to variable stars. We focus on light curves of RRLyrae type variables, in the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Light curves are thus summarized by a handful of complex eigenvalues, corresponding to oscillatory or fading dynamical modes. We find that variable stars of the RRc subclass can be summarized in terms of fewer ($\approx 8$) eigenvalues, while RRab need comparatively more ($\approx 12$). This result can be leveraged for classification and reflects the simpler structure of RRc light curves. We then consider variable stars displaying secular variations due to the Tseraskaya-Blazhko effect and find a change in relevant eigenvalues with time, with possible implications for the physical interpretation of the effect.</description>

      <title>Chemical tracers of a highly eccentric AGB-main sequence star binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary interactions have been proposed to explain a variety of circumstellar structures seen around evolved stars, including asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and planetary nebulae. Studies resolving the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars have revealed spirals, discs and bipolar outflows, with shaping attributed to interactions with a companion. For the first time, we have used a combined chemical and dynamical analysis to reveal a highly eccentric and long-period orbit for W Aquilae, a binary system containing an AGB star and a main sequence companion. Our results are based on anisotropic SiN emission, the first detections of NS and SiC towards an S-type star, and density structures observed in the CO emission. These features are all interpreted as having formed during periastron interactions. Our astrochemistry-based method can yield stringent constraints on the orbital parameters of long-period binaries containing AGB stars, and will be applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>MK-like spectral classification for hot subdwarf stars with LAMOST spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An MK-like spectral classification has been conducted for 1224 hot subdwarf stars with LAMOST DR9 low-resolution spectra. The whole sample was divided into four categories according to the spectral line characteristics: He-normal, He-weak, He-strong C and He-strong. Each selected spectrum was assigned a spectral class, a luminosity class and an helium class by comparing the line depth and width with standard spectra selected in LAMOST. Relationships between atmospheric parameters and spectral classification were also presented.</description>

      <title>Metal accretion scars may be common on magnetic, polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 30% of white dwarfs exhibit atmospheric metals, which are understood to be from recent or ongoing accretion of circumstellar debris. In cool white dwarfs, surface motions should rapidly homogenise photospheric abundances, and the accreted heavy elements should diffuse inward on a timescale much longer than that for surface mixing. The recent discovery of a metal scar on WD0816-310 implies its magnetic field has impeded surface mixing of metals near the visible magnetic pole. Here, we report the discovery of a second magnetic, metal-polluted white dwarf, WD2138-332, which exhibits periodic variability in longitudinal field, metal line strength, and broadband photometry. All three variable quantities have the same period, and show remarkable correlations: the published light curves have a brightness minimum exactly when the longitudinal field and line strength have a maximum, and a maximum when the longitudinal field and line strength have a minimum. The simplest interpretation of the line strength variability is that there is an enhanced metal concentration around one pole of the magnetic field; however, the variable line-blanketing cannot account for the observed multi-band light curves. More theoretical work is required to understand the efficiency of horizontal mixing of the accreted metal atoms, and the origin of photometric variability. Because both magnetic, metal-polluted white dwarfs that have been monitored to date show that metal line strengths vary in phase with the longitudinal field, we suggest that metal scars around magnetic poles may be a common feature of metal-polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Modelling non-radially propagating coronal mass ejections and forecasting the time of their arrival at Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of two solar eruptive events observed on December 7 2020 and October 28 2021.Both events were associated with full halo CMEs and flares.These events were chosen because they show a strong non-radial direction of propagation in the low corona and their main propagation direction is not fully aligned with the Sun-Earth line.This characteristic makes them suitable for our study, which aims to inspect how the non-radial direction of propagation in the low corona affects the time of CMEs' arrival at Earth.We reconstructed the CMEs using coronagraph observations and modelled them with EUHFORIA and the cone model for CMEs.To compare the accuracy of forecasting the CME arrival time at Earth obtained from different methods, we also used so-called typeII bursts, radio signatures of associated shocks, to find the velocities of the CME-driven shocks and forecast the time of their arrival at Earth.We also estimated the CME arrival time using the 2D CME velocity.Our results show that the lowest accuracy of estimated CME Earth arrival times is found when the 2D CME velocity is used.The velocity of the typeII radio bursts provides better, but still not very accurate, results.Employing, as an input to EUHFORIA, the CME parameters obtained from the GCS fittings at consequently increasing heights, results in a strongly improved accuracy of the modelled CME and shock arrival time Delta t changes from 14h to 10min for the first event, and from 12h to 30min for the second one.This improvement shows that when we increased the heights of the GCS reconstruction we accounted for the change in the propagation direction of the studied CMEs, which allowed us to accurately model the CME flank encounter at Earth. Our results show the great importance of the change in the direction of propagation of the CME in the low corona when modelling CMEs and estimating the time of their arrival at Earth.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in asymptotic giant branch stars and their winds. I. From 3D RHD models to synthetic observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] AGB stars are significant contributors to the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium. In this paper, we adapted models from advanced RHD simulations as input for radiative transfer software to create synthetic observables. A major goal is to describe an AGB star's non-sphericity and to simulate its effects on the surrounding dusty envelope. We developed tools to translate models of an AGB star and its dust-driven wind from simulations with CO5BOLD into the format used by RADMC-3D. We preserved the asymmetric shape of the star by including it as a `dust species' and by using temperature data computed in CO5BOLD. Circumstellar dust is included using Mg2SiO4 opacity data with spatially dependent grain sizes. We compared images and SEDs created with RADMC-3D of a model with similar output made with a spherically symmetric star. Our CO5BOLD model features substantial and clumpy dust formation just above 3.4 au from the grid centre, and large-scale structures due to giant convection cells are visible on the stellar surface. With the properties of VLTI as a basis, we have created simple synthetic observables. Such optical interferometers should be able to detect these dust clouds. We find that it is important to include asymmetric stellar models since they even affect the SEDs. Effects on flux levels can be linked to the clumpiness of the circumstellar dust and the angle-dependent illumination resulting from temperature variations on the stellar surface causes shifts in the wavelengths of the flux maximum. The methods presented here are an important step towards producing realistic synthetic observables and testing predictions of advanced 3D RHD models. Taking the angle-dependence of SEDs as a proxy for temporal variations in unresolved data, we conclude that not all variability observed in AGB stars should be interpreted as global changes in the sense of spherical models.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stellar intrinsic colors and dust reddenings for spectro-photometric data: From the blue-edge method to a machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for the studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict the ICs with the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, ${\rm log}\,g$, and $\rm [M/H]$. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and 2MASS bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 GSP-phot module and were validated by comparing with APOGEE and LAMOST. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for $\rm [M/H]$, do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})_0$, 0.050 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$, and 0.040 mag for $(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$. The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from Andrae et al. (2023) to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of $E(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})$ between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of $E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})/E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})$, a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and the accuracy of the machine-learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectro-photometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12787594}. The models for more bands will be completed in the following works.</description>

Abstract: During the last decade and a half, the new generation spectropolarimeter Narval at Pic du Midi, France allowed the study of weak magnetic fields in cool giant stars that are fairly evolved after main sequence. We present a short summary on the recent knowledge on the magnetic fields and activity in giants situated in the upper right part of the Hertzsprung-Russel (H-R) diagram and discuss on the possible mechanisms for magnetic field generation in the asymptotic giants branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars.</description>

      <title>She's Got Her Mother's Hair: End-to-End Collapsar Simulations Unveil the Origin of Black Holes' Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from a black hole (BH) following the core-collapse of a massive star (''collapsar'') is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Using MESA stellar evolution models followed to core-collapse, we explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities, likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit), results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic ''hair'' from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS's pre-collapse energy matches the excess energy in Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so. Our model indicates that standard GRB jets emerge whenever an accretion disk forms.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic arcades in explaining the puzzle of the gamma-ray emission from the solar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of gamma-ray emission originating from the solar disk ($0.5^\circ$ in angular size) as due to the interaction of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) with the solar atmosphere has remained a central challenge in solar physics. After the seminal work by Seckel, Stanev, and Gaisser (SSG91) based on GCRs magnetic mirroring, discrepancies between models and observations persist, indicating the need for a novel approach. The present work focuses on exploring the impact of a closed magnetic field geometry in the low photosphere on the observed gamma-ray flux. We track numerically with the PLUTO code the trajectories of test-particle protons within a static $\sim 20$ Mm scale height magnetic arcade adjacent to jets. By making use of numerical vertical density profiles we inject particles at distinct chromospheric/photospheric altitudes, mimicking the migration of GCRs from neighboring flux tubes into closed arcades. Remarkably, our model reproduces a flat gamma-ray spectrum below $\sim 33$ GeV, a nearly-isotropic emission at $\sim 10$ GeV, both consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, and a near-limb emission at $\sim 1$ TeV. Our model can also reproduce the flux-drop detected by HAWC ($\sim 1$ TeV). Finally, we argue that the spectral dip observed at $\sim$ 40 GeV may result from the flux suppression at low energy due to the cross-field diffusion, which would produce a cutoff. These findings underscore the pivotal role of closed magnetic field structures in shaping the solar disk gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Effect of irradiation and binary radio pulsars with giant companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate rapidly. Most pulsars in binary systems tend to spin faster than those in isolation. According to binary evolution theory, radio pulsars in binary systems can have various types of companion stars. However, currently, binary radio pulsars with companions of giant stars, helium stars, and black holes are still missing. We aim to investigate the possible parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code to consider the effect of irradiation in binary evolution and evolved a series of binary models. In this paper, we present the potential physical properties of binary radio pulsars with giant star companions under the framework of the classical recycling scenario and the irradiation model. We found that the parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions can be greatly expanded by the effect of irradiation. Moreover, if irradiation is strong enough, the sub-millisecond pulsars might be accompanied by giant companion stars. We also demonstrate a correlation between the timescale of the binary system being in the state of low mass X-ray binary and the irradiation efficiency. Birth rate problem between the millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries might not resolved by irradiation effect and a more detailed Binary Population Synthesis is necessary. Our findings may also offer guidance for observers to locate binary radio pulsars with giant companions or sub-millisecond pulsars.</description>

Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the binary Class 0 protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2 as part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program. We describe the $^{12}$CO ($J$=2--1), $^{13}$CO ($J$=2--1), C$^{18}$O ($J$=2--1), H$_2$CO ($J=3_{2,1}$--$2_{2,0}$), and SiO ($J$=5--4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.08" or $\sim$5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position-velocity diagram analysis of the C$^{18}$O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally-supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M$_\odot$ and 0.26 M$_\odot$ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by $^{12}$CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars within Vanishing Complexity Factor Formalism: Hydrostatic Equilibrium, Radial Oscillations, and Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and radial oscillations of anisotropic compact stars composed of dark energy, using the vanishing complexity factor formalism within general relativity. This novel approach establishes a direct link between the energy density and anisotropic factor, providing a robust framework for studying these exotic stellar objects. Employing an Extended Chaplygin Gas equation of state, we numerically compute interior solutions for both isotropic and anisotropic stars, revealing distinct differences in their properties. Additionally, we examine the oscillation modes and frequencies of these stars, highlighting the impact of anisotropy on their pulsational behavior. Our results reveal distinct differences in the stellar properties, such as the metric potentials, pressure, speed of sound, and relativistic adiabatic index, between the two cases. Furthermore, we calculate the large frequency separation for the fundamental and first excited modes, offering insights relevant for future asteroseismology studies. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of gravity, matter, and anisotropy in compact stars, providing a new perspective on dark energy's role in their structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-Variable Elemental Abundances in Coronal Loop Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous recent X-ray observations of coronal loops in both active regions (ARs) and solar flares have shown clearly that elemental abundances vary with time. Over the course of a flare, they have been found to move from coronal values towards photospheric values near the flare peak, before slowly returning to coronal values during the gradual phase. Coronal loop models typically assume that the elemental abundances are fixed, however. In this work, we introduce a time-variable abundance factor into the 0D ebtel++ code that models the changes due to chromospheric evaporation in order to understand how this affects coronal loop cooling. We find that for strong heating events ($\gtrsim$ 1 erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$), the abundances quickly tend towards photospheric values. For smaller heating rates, the abundances fall somewhere between coronal and photospheric values, causing the loop to cool more quickly than the time-fixed photospheric cases (typical flare simulations) and more slowly than time-fixed coronal cases (typical AR simulations). This suggests heating rates in quiescent AR loops no larger than $\approx 0.1$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ to be consistent with recent measurements of abundance factors $f \gtrsim 2$.</description>

Abstract: A structure of spherical white dwarfs is calculated for a non-zero temperature. It is shown that the thermodynamical stability of the white dwarf stars can be described naturally within the concept of the Helmholtz free energy of the Coulomb fully ionized electron-ion plasma.</description>
