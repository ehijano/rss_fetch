      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning Approach For Real-Time Malicious Url Detection Using Som-Rmo And Rbfn With Tabu Search Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of malicious URLs has become a significant threat to internet security, encompassing SPAM, phishing, malware, and defacement attacks. Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of these threats. Detecting malicious URLs in real-time requires advanced techniques capable of handling large datasets and identifying novel attack patterns. The challenge lies in developing a robust model that combines efficient feature extraction with accurate classification. We propose a hybrid machine learning approach combining Self-Organizing Map based Radial Movement Optimization (SOM-RMO) for feature extraction and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based Tabu Search for classification. SOM-RMO effectively reduces dimensionality and highlights significant features, while RBFN, optimized with Tabu Search, classifies URLs with high precision. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in detecting various malicious URL attacks. On a benchmark dataset, our approach achieved an accuracy of 96.5%, precision of 95.2%, recall of 94.8%, and an F1-score of 95.0%, outperforming traditional methods significantly.</description>

      <title>FORAY: Towards Effective Attack Synthesis against Deep Logical Vulnerabilities in DeFi Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain adoption has surged with the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. However, the significant value of digital assets managed by DeFi protocols makes them prime targets for attacks. Current smart contract vulnerability detection tools struggle with DeFi protocols due to deep logical bugs arising from complex financial interactions between multiple smart contracts. These tools primarily analyze individual contracts and resort to brute-force methods for DeFi protocols crossing numerous smart contracts, leading to inefficiency. We introduce Foray, a highly effective attack synthesis framework against deep logical bugs in DeFi protocols. Foray proposes a novel attack sketch generation and completion framework. Specifically, instead of treating DeFis as regular programs, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to lift the low-level smart contracts into their high-level financial operations. Based on our DSL, we first compile a given DeFi protocol into a token flow graph, our graphical representation of DeFi protocols. Then, we design an efficient sketch generation method to synthesize attack sketches for a certain attack goal (e.g., price manipulation, arbitrage, etc.). This algorithm strategically identifies candidate sketches by finding reachable paths in TFG, which is much more efficient than random enumeration. For each candidate sketch written in our DSL, Foray designs a domain-specific symbolic compilation to compile it into SMT constraints. Our compilation simplifies the constraints by removing redundant smart contract semantics. It maintains the usability of symbolic compilation, yet scales to problems orders of magnitude larger. Finally, the candidates are completed via existing solvers and are transformed into concrete attacks via direct syntax transformation.</description>

      <title>DLOVE: A new Security Evaluation Tool for Deep Learning Based Watermarking Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Deep Neural Network (DNN) based watermarking techniques have shown remarkable performance. The state-of-the-art DNN-based techniques not only surpass the robustness of classical watermarking techniques but also show their robustness against many image manipulation techniques. In this paper, we performed a detailed security analysis of different DNN-based watermarking techniques. We propose a new class of attack called the Deep Learning-based OVErwriting (DLOVE) attack, which leverages adversarial machine learning and overwrites the original embedded watermark with a targeted watermark in a watermarked image. To the best of our knowledge, this attack is the first of its kind. We have considered scenarios where watermarks are used to devise and formulate an adversarial attack in white box and black box settings. To show adaptability and efficiency, we launch our DLOVE attack analysis on seven different watermarking techniques, HiDDeN, ReDMark, PIMoG, Stegastamp, Aparecium, Distortion Agostic Deep Watermarking and Hiding Images in an Image. All these techniques use different approaches to create imperceptible watermarked images. Our attack analysis on these watermarking techniques with various constraints highlights the vulnerabilities of DNN-based watermarking. Extensive experimental results validate the capabilities of DLOVE. We propose DLOVE as a benchmark security analysis tool to test the robustness of future deep learning-based watermarking techniques.</description>

      <title>SEBA: Strong Evaluation of Biometric Anonymizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biometric data is pervasively captured and analyzed. Using modern machine learning approaches, identity and attribute inferences attacks have proven high accuracy. Anonymizations aim to mitigate such disclosures by modifying data in a way that prevents identification. However, the effectiveness of some anonymizations is unclear. Therefore, improvements of the corresponding evaluation methodology have been proposed recently. In this paper, we introduce SEBA, a framework for strong evaluation of biometric anonymizations. It combines and implements the state-of-the-art methodology in an easy-to-use and easy-to-expand software framework. This allows anonymization designers to easily test their techniques using a strong evaluation methodology. As part of this discourse, we introduce and discuss new metrics that allow for a more straightforward evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off that is inherent to anonymization attempts. Finally, we report on a prototypical experiment to demonstrate SEBA's applicability.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Vulnerability Feature Extraction Methods from Textual Attack Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, threat reports from cybersecurity vendors incorporate detailed descriptions of attacks within unstructured text. Knowing vulnerabilities that are related to these reports helps cybersecurity researchers and practitioners understand and adjust to evolving attacks and develop mitigation plans. This paper aims to aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners in choosing attack extraction methods to enhance the monitoring and sharing of threat intelligence. In this work, we examine five feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, LSI, BERT, MiniLM, RoBERTa) and find that Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) outperforms the other four methods with a precision of 75\% and an F1 score of 64\%. The findings offer valuable insights to the cybersecurity community, and our research can aid cybersecurity researchers in evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of upcoming extraction methods.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of the Laser Illumination on the Logic Cells Current Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical side-channel attacks represent a great challenge for today's chip design. Although attacks on CMOS dynamic power represent a class of state-of-the-art attacks, many other effects potentially affect the security of CMOS chips analogously by affecting mostly static behaviour of the chip, including aging, ionizing radiation, or non-ionizing illumination of the CMOS. Vulnerabilities exploiting data dependency in CMOS static power were already demonstrated in practice and the analogous vulnerability exploiting light-modulated static power was demonstrated by simulation. This work confirms the CMOS vulnerability related to the light-modulated data-dependent static power experimentally and discusses future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerabilities in software security can remain undiscovered even after being exploited. Linking attacks to vulnerabilities helps experts identify and respond promptly to the incident. This paper introduces VULDAT, a classification tool using a sentence transformer MPNET to identify system vulnerabilities from attack descriptions. Our model was applied to 100 attack techniques from the ATT&amp;CK repository and 685 issues from the CVE repository. Then, we compare the performance of VULDAT against the other eight state-of-the-art classifiers based on sentence transformers. Our findings indicate that our model achieves the best performance with F1 score of 0.85, Precision of 0.86, and Recall of 0.83. Furthermore, we found 56% of CVE reports vulnerabilities associated with an attack were identified by VULDAT, and 61% of identified vulnerabilities were in the CVE repository.</description>

      <title>A BERT-based Empirical Study of Privacy Policies' Compliance with GDPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its implementation in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has prompted businesses to revisit and revise their data handling practices to ensure compliance. The privacy policy, which serves as the primary means of informing users about their privacy rights and the data practices of companies, has been significantly updated by numerous businesses post-GDPR implementation. However, many privacy policies remain packed with technical jargon, lengthy explanations, and vague descriptions of data practices and user rights. This makes it a challenging task for users and regulatory authorities to manually verify the GDPR compliance of these privacy policies. In this study, we aim to address the challenge of compliance analysis between GDPR (Article 13) and privacy policies for 5G networks. We manually collected privacy policies from almost 70 different 5G MNOs, and we utilized an automated BERT-based model for classification. We show that an encouraging 51$\%$ of companies demonstrate a strong adherence to GDPR. In addition, we present the first study that provides current empirical evidence on the readability of privacy policies for 5G network. we adopted readability analysis toolset that incorporates various established readability metrics. The findings empirically show that the readability of the majority of current privacy policies remains a significant challenge. Hence, 5G providers need to invest considerable effort into revising these documents to enhance both their utility and the overall user experience.</description>

      <title>Event Trojan: Asynchronous Event-based Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As asynchronous event data is more frequently engaged in various vision tasks, the risk of backdoor attacks becomes more evident. However, research into the potential risk associated with backdoor attacks in asynchronous event data has been scarce, leaving related tasks vulnerable to potential threats. This paper has uncovered the possibility of directly poisoning event data streams by proposing Event Trojan framework, including two kinds of triggers, i.e., immutable and mutable triggers. Specifically, our two types of event triggers are based on a sequence of simulated event spikes, which can be easily incorporated into any event stream to initiate backdoor attacks. Additionally, for the mutable trigger, we design an adaptive learning mechanism to maximize its aggressiveness. To improve the stealthiness, we introduce a novel loss function that constrains the generated contents of mutable triggers, minimizing the difference between triggers and original events while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments on public event datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor triggers. We hope that this paper can draw greater attention to the potential threats posed by backdoor attacks on event-based tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/rfww/EventTrojan.</description>

      <title>TimeTravel: Real-time Timing Drift Attack on System Time Using Acoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time Clock (RTC) has been widely used in various real-time systems to provide precise system time. In this paper, we reveal a new security vulnerability of the RTC circuit, where the internal storage time or timestamp can be arbitrarily modified forward or backward. The security threat of dynamic modifications of system time caused by this vulnerability is called TimeTravel. Based on acoustic resonance and piezoelectric effects, TimeTravel applies acoustic guide waves to the quartz crystal, thereby adjusting the characteristics of the oscillating signal transmitted into the RTC circuit. By manipulating the parameters of acoustic waves, TimeTravel can accelerate or decelerate the timing speed of system time at an adjustable rate, resulting in the relative drift of the timing, which can pose serious safety threats. To assess the severity of TimeTravel, we examine nine modules and two commercial devices under the RTC circuit. The experimental results show that TimeTravel can drift system time forward and backward at a chosen speed with a maximum 93% accuracy. Our analysis further shows that TimeTravel can maintain an attack success rate of no less than 77% under environments with typical obstacle items.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Multiway and $k$-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the minimum $k$-cut and multiway cut problems. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems.
  For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted graphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our algorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts, resulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private algorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>

      <title>An Improved Two-Step Attack on CRYSTALS-Kyber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After three rounds of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strict evaluations conducted by the national institute of standards and technology (NIST), CRYSTALS-Kyber has successfully been selected and drafted for standardization from the mid of 2022. It becomes urgent to further evaluate Kyber's physical security for the upcoming deployment phase. In this paper, we present an improved two-step attack on Kyber to quickly recover the full secret key, s, by using much fewer energy traces and less time. In the first step, we use the correlation power analysis (CPA) attack to obtain a portion of guess values of s with a small number of energy traces. The CPA attack is enhanced by utilizing both the Pearson and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and modifying the leakage model to improve the accuracy. In the second step, we adopt the lattice attack to recover s based on the results of CPA. The success rate is largely built up by constructing a trail-and-error method. We implement the proposed attack for the reference implementation of Kyber512 (4 128-value groups of s) on ARM Cortex-M4 and successfully recover a 128-value group of s in about 9 minutes using a 16-core machine. Additionally, in that case, we only cost at most 60 CPA guess values for a group and 15 power traces for a guess.</description>

      <title>ICLGuard: Controlling In-Context Learning Behavior for Applicability Authorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model. Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input. It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility. However, this capability also introduces potential issues. For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests. As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content. To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data. ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM. Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Blockchain-Based Approach for Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Differentially Private Blockchain-Based Vertical Federal Learning (DP-BBVFL) algorithm that provides verifiability and privacy guarantees for decentralized applications. DP-BBVFL uses a smart contract to aggregate the feature representations, i.e., the embeddings, from clients transparently. We apply local differential privacy to provide privacy for embeddings stored on a blockchain, hence protecting the original data. We provide the first prototype application of differential privacy with blockchain for vertical federated learning. Our experiments with medical data show that DP-BBVFL achieves high accuracy with a tradeoff in training time due to on-chain aggregation. This innovative fusion of differential privacy and blockchain technology in DP-BBVFL could herald a new era of collaborative and trustworthy machine learning applications across several decentralized application domains.</description>

      <title>If You Don't Understand It, Don't Use It: Eliminating Trojans with Filters Between Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes exhibit dangerous unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is massive -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for all possible inputs that may elicit such behavior. One specific and particularly challenging case is that if data-poisoning-injected trojans, since there is no way to know what they are to search for them. To our knowledge, there is no generally applicable method to unlearn unknown trojans injected during pre-training. This work seeks to provide a general purpose recipe (filters) and a specific implementation (LoRA) filters that work in practice on small to medium sized models. The focus is primarily empirical, though some perplexing behavior opens the door to the fundamental question of how LLMs store and process information. Not unexpectedly, we find that our filters work best on the residual stream and the latest layers.</description>

However the privacy analysis of DP-SGD makes the unrealistic assumption that all intermediate iterates (aka internal state) of the algorithm are released since in practice, only the final trained model, i.e., the final iterate of the algorithm is released. In this hidden state setting, prior work has provided tighter analyses, albeit only when the loss function is constrained, e.g., strongly convex and smooth or linear. On the other hand, the privacy leakage observed empirically from hidden state DP-SGD, even when using non-convex loss functions suggest that there is in fact a gap between the theoretical privacy analysis and the privacy guarantees achieved in practice. Therefore, it remains an open question whether privacy amplification for DP-SGD is possible in the hidden state setting for general loss functions.
  Unfortunately, this work answers the aforementioned research question negatively. By carefully constructing a loss function for DP-SGD, we show that for specific loss functions, the final iterate of DP-SGD alone leaks as much information as the sequence of all iterates combined. Furthermore, we empirically verify this result by evaluating the privacy leakage from the final iterate of DP-SGD with our loss function and show that this matches the theoretical upper bound guaranteed by DP exactly. Therefore, we show that the current privacy analysis fo DP-SGD is tight for general loss functions and conclude that no privacy amplification is possible for DP-SGD in general for all (possibly non-convex) loss functions.</description>

Abstract: Security requirements for the Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor nodes, and other wireless devices connected in a network for data exchange are high. These devices are often subject to lab analysis with the objective to reveal secret hidden information. One kind of attacks to reveal the cryptographic key is to perform optical Fault Injection attacks. In this work, we investigated the IHP radiation tolerant shift registers built of Triple Modular Redundant flip-flops. In our experiments, we were able to inject different transient faults into TMR registers.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Reproducibility of Experimental Results Especially in the Domain of Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security especially in the fields of IoT, industrial automation and critical infrastructure is paramount nowadays and a hot research topic. In order to ensure confidence in research results they need to be reproducible. In the past we reported [18] that in many publications important information such as details about the equipment used are missing. In this paper we report on our own experiments that we run to verify the parameters reported in the datasheets that came along with our experimental equipment. Our results show that there are significant discrepancies between the datasheets and the real world data. These deviations concern accuracy of positions, movements, duration of laser shots etc. In order to improve reproducibility of results we therefore argue on the one hand that research groups verify the data given in datasheets of equipment they use and on the other hand that they provide measurement set-up parameters in globally accepted units such as cm, seconds, etc.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embedding Approaches under Non-adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) transforms a discrete Knowledge Graph (KG) into a continuous vector space facilitating its use in various AI-driven applications like Semantic Search, Question Answering, or Recommenders. While KGE approaches are effective in these applications, most existing approaches assume that all information in the given KG is correct. This enables attackers to influence the output of these approaches, e.g., by perturbing the input. Consequently, the robustness of such KGE approaches has to be addressed. Recent work focused on adversarial attacks. However, non-adversarial attacks on all attack surfaces of these approaches have not been thoroughly examined. We close this gap by evaluating the impact of non-adversarial attacks on the performance of 5 state-of-the-art KGE algorithms on 5 datasets with respect to attacks on 3 attack surfaces-graph, parameter, and label perturbation. Our evaluation results suggest that label perturbation has a strong effect on the KGE performance, followed by parameter perturbation with a moderate and graph with a low effect.</description>

      <title>Prompting Techniques for Secure Code Generation: A Systematic Investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</description>

      <title>Explainable Hyperdimensional Computing for Balancing Privacy and Transparency in Additive Manufacturing Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07066v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ sensing, in conjunction with learning models, presents a unique opportunity to address persistent defect issues in Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. However, this integration introduces significant data privacy concerns, such as data leakage, sensor data compromise, and model inversion attacks, revealing critical details about part design, material composition, and machine parameters. Differential Privacy (DP) models, which inject noise into data under mathematical guarantees, offer a nuanced balance between data utility and privacy by obscuring traces of sensing data. However, the introduction of noise into learning models, often functioning as black boxes, complicates the prediction of how specific noise levels impact model accuracy. This study introduces the Differential Privacy-HyperDimensional computing (DP-HD) framework, leveraging the explainability of the vector symbolic paradigm to predict the noise impact on the accuracy of in-situ monitoring, safeguarding sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency. Experimental results on real-world high-speed melt pool data of AM for detecting overhang anomalies demonstrate that DP-HD achieves superior operational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust privacy protection, outperforming state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models. For example, when implementing the same level of privacy protection (with a privacy budget set at 1), our model achieved an accuracy of 94.43%, surpassing the performance of traditional models such as ResNet50 (52.30%), GoogLeNet (23.85%), AlexNet (55.78%), DenseNet201 (69.13%), and EfficientNet B2 (40.81%). Notably, DP-HD maintains high performance under substantial noise additions designed to enhance privacy, unlike current models that suffer significant accuracy declines under high privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>A False Sense of Privacy: Towards a Reliable Evaluation Methodology for the Anonymization of Biometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biometric data contains distinctive human traits such as facial features or gait patterns. The use of biometric data permits an individuation so exact that the data is utilized effectively in identification and authentication systems. But for this same reason, privacy protections become indispensably necessary. Privacy protection is extensively afforded by the technique of anonymization. Anonymization techniques protect sensitive personal data from biometrics by obfuscating or removing information that allows linking records to the generating individuals, to achieve high levels of anonymity. However, our understanding and possibility to develop effective anonymization relies, in equal parts, on the effectiveness of the methods employed to evaluate anonymization performance. In this paper, we assess the state-of-the-art methods used to evaluate the performance of anonymization techniques for facial images and for gait patterns. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art evaluation methods have serious and frequent shortcomings. In particular, we find that the underlying assumptions of the state-of-the-art are quite unwarranted. State-of-the-art methods generally assume a difficult recognition scenario and thus a weak adversary. However, that assumption causes state-of-the-art evaluations to grossly overestimate the performance of the anonymization. Therefore, we propose a strong adversary which is aware of the anonymization in place. We improve the selection process for the evaluation dataset, and we reduce the numbers of identities contained in the dataset while ensuring that these identities remain easily distinguishable from one another. Our novel evaluation methodology surpasses the state-of-the-art because we measure worst-case performance and so deliver a highly reliable evaluation of biometric anonymization techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Difficulty Calibration for Enhanced Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, are currently an integral part of various applications, from healthcare to finance. However, using sensitive data to train these models raises concerns about privacy and security. One method that has emerged to verify if the trained models are privacy-preserving is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which allows adversaries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's training dataset. While a series of MIAs have been proposed in the literature, only a few can achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) region (0.01%~1%). This is a crucial factor to consider for an MIA to be practically useful in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a novel approach to MIA that is aimed at significantly improving TPR at low FPRs. Our method, named learning-based difficulty calibration for MIA(LDC-MIA), characterizes data records by their hardness levels using a neural network classifier to determine membership. The experiment results show that LDC-MIA can improve TPR at low FPR by up to 4x compared to the other difficulty calibration based MIAs. It also has the highest Area Under ROC curve (AUC) across all datasets. Our method's cost is comparable with most of the existing MIAs, but is orders of magnitude more efficient than one of the state-of-the-art methods, LiRA, while achieving similar performance.</description>

      <title>Communication Optimal Unbalanced Private Set Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the private set union (PSU) problem, where two parties each hold a private set of elements, and they want one of the parties (the receiver) to learn the union of the two sets and nothing else. Our protocols are targeted for the unbalanced case where the receiver's set size is larger than the sender's set size, with the goal of minimizing the costs for the sender both in terms of communication volume and local computation time. This setting is motivated by applications where the receiver has significantly more data (input set size) and computational resources than the sender which might be realized on a small, low-power device. Asymptotically, we achieve communication cost linear in the sender's (smaller) set size, and computation costs for sender and receiver which are nearly-linear in their respective set sizes. To our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm to achieve nearly-linear communication and computation for PSU in this unbalanced setting. Our protocols utilize fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and, optionally, linearly homomorphic encryption (LHE) to perform the necessary computations while preserving privacy. The underlying computations are based on univariate polynomial arithmetic realized within homomorphic encryption, namely fast multiplication, modular reduction, and multi-point evaluation. These asymptotically fast HE polynomial arithmetic algorithms may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the embedding projection layer (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access. For under \$20 USD, our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI's Ada and Babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively. We also recover the exact hidden dimension size of the gpt-3.5-turbo model, and estimate it would cost under $2,000 in queries to recover the entire projection matrix. We conclude with potential defenses and mitigations, and discuss the implications of possible future work that could extend our attack.</description>

      <title>A hybrid LLM workflow can help identify user privilege related variables in programs of any size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many programs involves operations and logic manipulating user privileges, which is essential for the security of an organization. Therefore, one common malicious goal of attackers is to obtain or escalate the privileges, causing privilege leakage. To protect the program and the organization against privilege leakage attacks, it is important to eliminate the vulnerabilities which can be exploited to achieve such attacks. Unfortunately, while memory vulnerabilities are less challenging to find, logic vulnerabilities are much more imminent, harmful and difficult to identify. Accordingly, many analysts choose to find user privilege related (UPR) variables first as start points to investigate the code where the UPR variables may be used to see if there exists any vulnerabilities, especially the logic ones. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) workflow that can assist analysts in identifying such UPR variables, which is considered to be a very time-consuming task. Specifically, our tool will audit all the variables in a program and output a UPR score, which is the degree of relationship (closeness) between the variable and user privileges, for each variable. The proposed approach avoids the drawbacks introduced by directly prompting a LLM to find UPR variables by focusing on leverage the LLM at statement level instead of supplying LLM with very long code snippets. Those variables with high UPR scores are essentially potential UPR variables, which should be manually investigated. Our experiments show that using a typical UPR score threshold (i.e., UPR score &gt;0.8), the false positive rate (FPR) is only 13.49%, while UPR variable found is significantly more than that of the heuristic based method.</description>

      <title>Defending Large Language Models Against Attacks With Residual Stream Activation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, brings to the forefront the imperative to defend against adversarial threats on these models. These attacks, which manipulate an LLM's output by introducing malicious inputs, undermine the model's integrity and the trust users place in its outputs. In response to this challenge, our paper presents an innovative defensive strategy, given white box access to an LLM, that harnesses residual activation analysis between transformer layers of the LLM. We apply a novel methodology for analyzing distinctive activation patterns in the residual streams for attack prompt classification. We curate multiple datasets to demonstrate how this method of classification has high accuracy across multiple types of attack scenarios, including our newly-created attack dataset. Furthermore, we enhance the model's resilience by integrating safety fine-tuning techniques for LLMs in order to measure its effect on our capability to detect attacks. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs, advancing the security framework within which LLMs operate.</description>

      <title>P3GNN: A Privacy-Preserving Provenance Graph-Based Model for APT Detection in Software Defined Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software Defined Networking (SDN) has brought significant advancements in network management and programmability. However, this evolution has also heightened vulnerability to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), sophisticated and stealthy cyberattacks that traditional detection methods often fail to counter, especially in the face of zero-day exploits. A prevalent issue is the inadequacy of existing strategies to detect novel threats while addressing data privacy concerns in collaborative learning scenarios. This paper presents P3GNN (privacy-preserving provenance graph-based graph neural network model), a novel model that synergizes Federated Learning (FL) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for effective APT detection in SDN environments. P3GNN utilizes unsupervised learning to analyze operational patterns within provenance graphs, identifying deviations indicative of security breaches. Its core feature is the integration of FL with homomorphic encryption, which fortifies data confidentiality and gradient integrity during collaborative learning. This approach addresses the critical challenge of data privacy in shared learning contexts. Key innovations of P3GNN include its ability to detect anomalies at the node level within provenance graphs, offering a detailed view of attack trajectories and enhancing security analysis. Furthermore, the models unsupervised learning capability enables it to identify zero-day attacks by learning standard operational patterns. Empirical evaluation using the DARPA TCE3 dataset demonstrates P3GNNs exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.93 and a low false positive rate of 0.06.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring privacy and protection from issuer corruption in digital identity systems is crucial. We propose a method for selective disclosure and privacy-preserving revocation of digital credentials using second-order Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. We make holders able to present proofs of possession of selected credentials without disclosing them, and we protect their presentations from replay attacks. Revocations may be distributed among multiple revocation issuers using publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) and activated only by configurable consensus, ensuring robust protection against issuer corruption. Our system's unique design enables extremely fast revocation checks, even with large revocation lists, leveraging optimized hash map lookups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for processing vast volumes of data has surged dramatically due to the advancement of machine learning technology. Large-scale data processing necessitates substantial computational resources, prompting individuals and enterprises to turn to cloud services. Accompanying this trend is a growing concern regarding data leakage and misuse. Homomorphic encryption (HE) is one solution for safeguarding data privacy, enabling encrypted data to be processed securely in the cloud. However, the encryption and decryption routines of some HE schemes require considerable computational resources, presenting non-trivial work for clients. In this paper, we propose an outsourced decryption protocol for the prevailing RLWE-based fully homomorphic encryption schemes. The protocol splits the original decryption into two routines, with the computationally intensive part executed remotely by the cloud. Its security relies on an invariant of the NTRU-search problem with a newly designed blinding key distribution. Cryptographic analyses are conducted to configure protocol parameters across varying security levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves up to a $67\%$ acceleration in the client's local decryption, accompanied by a $50\%$ reduction in space usage.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of deep learning in various applications, privacy concerns around the protection of training data have become a critical area of research. Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.</description>

      <title>AUTOLYCUS: Exploiting Explainable AI (XAI) for Model Extraction Attacks against Interpretable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to uncover the decision-making processes of AI models. However, the data used for such explanations can pose security and privacy risks. Existing literature identifies attacks on machine learning models, including membership inference, model inversion, and model extraction attacks. These attacks target either the model or the training data, depending on the settings and parties involved.
  XAI tools can increase the vulnerability of model extraction attacks, which is a concern when model owners prefer black-box access, thereby keeping model parameters and architecture private. To exploit this risk, we propose AUTOLYCUS, a novel retraining (learning) based model extraction attack framework against interpretable models under black-box settings. As XAI tools, we exploit Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley values (SHAP) to infer decision boundaries and create surrogate models that replicate the functionality of the target model. LIME and SHAP are mainly chosen for their realistic yet information-rich explanations, coupled with their extensive adoption, simplicity, and usability.
  We evaluate AUTOLYCUS on six machine learning datasets, measuring the accuracy and similarity of the surrogate model to the target model. The results show that AUTOLYCUS is highly effective, requiring significantly fewer queries compared to state-of-the-art attacks, while maintaining comparable accuracy and similarity. We validate its performance and transferability on multiple interpretable ML models, including decision trees, logistic regression, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbor. Additionally, we show the resilience of AUTOLYCUS against proposed countermeasures.</description>

      <title>VEXIR2Vec: An Architecture-Neutral Embedding Framework for Binary Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary similarity involves determining whether two binary programs exhibit similar functionality, often originating from the same source code. In this work, we propose VexIR2Vec, an approach for binary similarity using VEX-IR, an architecture-neutral Intermediate Representation (IR). We extract the embeddings from sequences of basic blocks, termed peepholes, derived by random walks on the control-flow graph. The peepholes are normalized using transformations inspired by compiler optimizations. The VEX-IR Normalization Engine mitigates, with these transformations, the architectural and compiler-induced variations in binaries while exposing semantic similarities. We then learn the vocabulary of representations at the entity level of the IR using the knowledge graph embedding techniques in an unsupervised manner. This vocabulary is used to derive function embeddings for similarity assessment using VexNet, a feed-forward Siamese network designed to position similar functions closely and separate dissimilar ones in an n-dimensional space. This approach is amenable for both diffing and searching tasks, ensuring robustness against Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) issues.
  We evaluate VexIR2Vec on a dataset comprising 2.7M functions and 15.5K binaries from 7 projects compiled across 12 compilers targeting x86 and ARM architectures. In diffing experiments, VexIR2Vec outperforms the nearest baselines by $40\%$, $18\%$, $21\%$, and $60\%$ in cross-optimization, cross-compilation, cross-architecture, and obfuscation settings, respectively. In the searching experiment, VexIR2Vec achieves a mean average precision of $0.76$, outperforming the nearest baseline by $46\%$. Our framework is highly scalable and is built as a lightweight, multi-threaded, parallel library using only open-source tools. VexIR2Vec is $3.1$-$3.5 \times$ faster than the closest baselines and orders-of-magnitude faster than other tools.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Graph Reduction Against GNN Backdoor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining popularity across various domains due to their effectiveness in learning graph-structured data. Nevertheless, they have been shown to be susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks, which pose serious threats to real-world applications. Meanwhile, graph reduction techniques, including coarsening and sparsification, which have long been employed to improve the scalability of large graph computational tasks, have recently emerged as effective methods for accelerating GNN training on large-scale graphs. However, the current development and deployment of graph reduction techniques for large graphs overlook the potential risks of data poisoning attacks against GNNs. It is not yet clear how graph reduction interacts with existing backdoor attacks. This paper conducts a thorough examination of the robustness of graph reduction methods in scalable GNN training in the presence of state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. We performed a comprehensive robustness analysis across six coarsening methods and six sparsification methods for graph reduction, under three GNN backdoor attacks against three GNN architectures. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of graph reduction methods in mitigating attack success rates varies significantly, with some methods even exacerbating the attacks. Through detailed analyses of triggers and poisoned nodes, we interpret our findings and enhance our understanding of how graph reduction influences robustness against backdoor attacks. These results highlight the critical need for incorporating robustness considerations in graph reduction for GNN training, ensuring that enhancements in computational efficiency do not compromise the security of GNN systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Learn-to-Distort-Data Framework for Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Trustworthy Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first give an introduction to the theoretical basis of the privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning based on Bayesian privacy definitions and total variation distance privacy definitions. We then present the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework, which provides a principled approach to navigate the privacy-utility equilibrium by explicitly modeling the distortion introduced by the privacy-preserving mechanism as a learnable variable and optimizing it jointly with the model parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework to a variety of privacy-preserving mechanisms on the basis of data distortion and highlight its connections to related areas such as adversarial training, input robustness, and unlearnable examples. These connections enable leveraging techniques from these areas to design effective algorithms for privacy-utility equilibrium in federated learning under the \textit{Learn-to-Distort-Data} framework.</description>
