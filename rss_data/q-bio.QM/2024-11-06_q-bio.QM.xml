      <title>Diagnostic Performance of Deep Learning for Predicting Gliomas' IDH and 1p/19q Status in MRI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, show high heterogeneity in histological and molecular characteristics. Accurate molecular profiling, like isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This review evaluates MRI-based deep learning (DL) models' efficacy in predicting these biomarkers. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science) up to February 2024, screening studies that utilized DL to predict IDH and 1p/19q codeletion status from MRI data of glioma patients. We assessed the quality and risk of bias using the radiomics quality score and QUADAS-2 tool. Our meta-analysis used a bivariate model to compute pooled sensitivity, specificity, and meta-regression to assess inter-study heterogeneity. Of the 565 articles, 57 were selected for qualitative synthesis, and 52 underwent meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed high diagnostic performance, with validation sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 [prediction interval (PI): 0.67-0.93, I2=51.10%, p &lt; 0.05], 0.87 [PI: 0.49-0.98, I2=82.30%, p &lt; 0.05], and 0.89 for IDH prediction, and 0.76 [PI: 0.28-0.96, I2=77.60%, p &lt; 0.05], 0.85 [PI: 0.49-0.97, I2=80.30%, p &lt; 0.05], and 0.90 for 1p/19q prediction, respectively. Meta-regression analyses revealed significant heterogeneity influenced by glioma grade, data source, inclusion of non-radiomics data, MRI sequences, segmentation and feature extraction methods, and validation techniques. DL models demonstrate strong potential in predicting molecular biomarkers from MRI scans, with significant variability influenced by technical and clinical factors. Thorough external validation is necessary to increase clinical utility.</description>

      <title>Radical-mediated Electrical Enzyme Assay For At-home Clinical Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for accurate, rapid, and cost-effective at-home clinical testing, we developed a radical-mediated enzyme assay (REEA) integrated with a paper fluidic system and electrically read by a handheld field-effect transistor (FET) device. The REEA utilizes horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the conversion of aromatic substrates into radical forms, producing protons detected by an ion-sensitive FET for biomarker quantification. Through screening 14 phenolic compounds, halogenated phenols emerged as optimal substrates for the REEA. Encased in an affordable cartridge ($0.55 per test), the system achieved a detection limit of 146 fg/mL for estradiol (E2), with a coefficient of variation (CV) below 9.2% in E2-spiked samples and an r2 of 0.963 across a measuring range of 19 to 4,551 pg/mL in clinical plasma samples, providing results in under 10 minutes. This adaptable system not only promises to offer a fast and reliable platform, but also holds significant potential for expansion to a wide array of biomarkers, paving the way for broader clinical and home-based applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus concentrations and intra-individual variability in recipients of heart transplants during the early post-heart transplantation period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus blood levels and intra-individual variability in recipients of heart transplants during the early post-transplantation period. Demographic information, concomitant medications, daily tacrolimus dose, trough concentration, and physiological and biochemical information of 87 Chinese recipients of heart transplants were collected. Trough concentrations were determined using a chemiluminescent micro-particle immunoassay, and 17 selected single nucleic acid polymorphisms were genotyped by direct sequencing. We assessed intra-individual variability by calculating the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus trough concentration and analyzed factors associated with tacrolimus concentration and intra-individual variability. Our study found that low body weight and a high percentage of neutrophils significantly influenced the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus. CYP3A5*1D and CYP3A7 rs776744 haplotypes correlated significantly with an intra-individual coefficient of variation of tacrolimus trough concentration during the early postoperative period. Patients with the CYP3A5*1D rs15524 and CYP3A7 rs776744 TT haplotype had a higher coefficient of variation than carriers of the C allele. Genetic polymorphisms in recipients of heart transplants affect tacrolimus metabolism, significantly affecting tacrolimus blood concentration during the early postoperative period. Genotyping before drug administration can help optimize dosing regimens, reduce intra-individual variability, and improve prognosis.</description>

      <title>bursty_dynamics: A Python Package for Exploring the Temporal Properties of Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the temporal properties of longitudinal data is critical for identifying trends, predicting future events, and making informed decisions in any field where temporal data is analysed, including health and epidemiology, finance, geosciences, and social sciences. Traditional time-series analysis techniques often fail to capture the complexity of irregular temporal patterns present in such data. To address this gap, we introduce bursty_dynamics, a Python package that enables the quantification of bursty dynamics through the calculation of the Burstiness Parameter (BP) and Memory Coefficient (MC). In temporal data, BP and MC provide insights into the irregularity and temporal dependencies within event sequences, shedding light on complex patterns of disease aetiology, human behaviour, or other information diffusion over time. An event train detection method is also implemented to identify clustered events occurring within a specified time interval, allowing for more focused analysis with reduced noise. With built-in visualisation tools, bursty_dynamics provides an accessible yet powerful platform for researchers to explore and interpret the temporal dynamics of longitudinal data. This paper outlines the core functionalities of the package, demonstrates its applications in diverse research domains, and discusses the advantages of using BP, MC, and event train detection for enhanced temporal data analysis.</description>

      <title>Target search on networks-within-networks with applications to protein-DNA interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for understanding node target search in systems organized as hierarchical networks-within-networks. Our work generalizes traditional search models on complex networks, where the mean-first passage time is typically inversely proportional to the node degree. However, real-world search processes often span multiple network layers, such as moving from an external environment into a local network, and then navigating several internal states. This multilayered complexity appears in scenarios such as international travel networks, tracking email spammers, and the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions in cells. Our theory addresses these complex systems by modeling them as a three-layer multiplex network: an external source layer, an intermediate spatial layer, and an internal state layer. We derive general closed-form solutions for the steady-state flux through a target node, which serves as a proxy for inverse mean-first passage time. Our results reveal a universal relationship between search efficiency and network-specific parameters. This work extends the current understanding of multiplex networks by focusing on systems with hierarchically connected layers. Our findings have broad implications for fields ranging from epidemiology to cellular biology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of search dynamics in complex, multilayered environments.</description>
