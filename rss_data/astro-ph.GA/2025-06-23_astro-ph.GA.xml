      <title>Hybrid-chimes: A model for radiative cooling and the abundances of ions and molecules in simulations of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative processes play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and chemical states of gas across diverse astrophysical environments, from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the intergalactic medium. We present a hybrid cooling model for cosmological simulations that incorporates a comprehensive treatment of radiative processes, including parameterizations of the interstellar radiation field, cosmic ray rates, and dust physics. The model uses the chimes chemical network and combines on-the-fly non-equilibrium calculations with quasi-equilibrium cooling rates. The quasi-equilibrium rates account for the time-dependent free electron fractions of elements tracked in non-equilibrium, balancing computational efficiency with physical accuracy. We evaluate the performance under various conditions, including the thermal evolution of primordial gas at the cosmic mean density, the properties of the warm and cold neutral media in Milky Way-like galaxies, and the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition. We demonstrate that thermal equilibrium predictions for the neutral phases of the ISM underestimate the median gas pressures in simulations of isolated galaxies by up to 0.5 dex. Finally we find that the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition is shifted to lower densities by up to 1 dex if oxygen is not included in the chemical network. Our work provides a robust framework for studying the multi-phase ISM and its role in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Novel $z\sim~10$ auroral line measurements extend the gradual offset of the FMR deep into the first Gyr of cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass assembly and chemical enrichment of the first galaxies provide key insights into their star-formation histories and the earliest stellar populations at cosmic dawn. Here we compile and utilize new, high-quality spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec Prism observations from the JWST archive. We extend the wavelength coverage beyond the standard pipeline cutoff up to 5.5$\mu$m, enabling a detailed examination of the rest-frame optical emission-line properties for galaxies at $z\approx 10$. The improved calibration allows us to detect H$\beta$ and the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4959,5007$ doublet and resolve the auroral [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ line for the 11 galaxies in our sample ($z=9.3-10.0$) to obtain direct $T_e$-based metallicity measurements. We find that all galaxies show high ionisation fields and electron temperatures, with derived metallicities in the range $12+\log {\rm (O/H)} = 7.1 - 8.3$, consistent with previous strong-line diagnostics at high-z. We derive an empirical relation for $M_{\rm UV}$ and 12+log(O/H) at $z\approx 10$, useful for future higher-z studies, and show that the sample galaxies are `typical' star-forming galaxies though with relatively high specific star-formation rates and with evidence for bursty star formation. Combining the rest-frame optical line analysis and detailed UV to optical SED modelling, we determine the mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental-metallicity relation of the sample, pushing the redshift frontier of these measurements to $z=10$. These results, together with literature measurements, point to a gradually decreasing MZR at higher redshifts, with a break in the FMR at $z\approx 3$, decreasing to metallicities $\approx 3\times$ lower at $z=10$ than observed during the majority of cosmic time at $z=0-3$, likely caused by massive pristine gas inflows diluting the observed metal abundances during early galaxy assembly at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at $z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$) undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by, dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio $M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $&gt;10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.</description>

      <title>How invisible stellar halos bias our understanding of ultra-faint galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how a realistic surface brightness detection limit of $\mu_V \approx 32.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ for stars at the edges of ultra-faint galaxies affects our ability to infer their underlying properties. We use a sample of 19 galaxies with stellar masses $\approx 400 - 40,000~{\rm M}_\odot$ simulated with FIRE-2 physics and baryonic mass resolution of $30~M_{\odot}$. The surface brightness cut leads to smaller sizes, lower stellar masses, and lower stellar velocity dispersions than the values inferred without the cut. However, by imposing this realistic limit, our inferred galaxy properties lie closer to observed populations in the mass-size plane, better match observed velocity dispersions as a function of stellar mass, and better reproduce derived circular velocities as a function of half-light radius. For the most massive galaxies in our sample, the surface brightness cut leads to higher mean $\rm [Fe/H]$ values, but the increase is not enough to match the observed MZR. Finally, we demonstrate that the common Wolf et al. (2010) mass estimator is less accurate when the surface brightness cut is applied. For our lowest-mass galaxies, in particular, excluding the low-surface brightness outskirts causes us to overestimate their central dark-matter densities and virial masses. This suggests that attempts to use mass estimates of ultra-faint galaxies to constrain dark-matter physics or to place constraints on the low-mass threshold of galaxy formation must take into account surface brightness limits or risk significant biases.</description>

      <title>HI asymmetries in spatially resolved SIMBA galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) content of spatially resolved, low-redshift galaxies in the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We create synthetic HI data cubes designed to match observations from the Apertif Medium-Deep HI imaging survey, and follow an observational approach to derive the HI size-mass relation. The HI size-mass relation for SIMBA is in broad agreement with the observed relation to within 0.1 dex, but SIMBA galaxies are slightly smaller than expected at fixed HI mass. We quantify the HI spectral ($A_{\mathrm{flux}}$) and morphological ($A_{\mathrm{mod}}$) asymmetries of the galaxies and motivate standardizing the relative spatial resolution when comparing values in a sample that spans several orders of magnitude in HI mass. Galaxies are classified into three categories (isolated, interacted, or merged) based on their dynamical histories over the preceding ~2 Gyr to contextualize disturbances in their HI reservoirs. We determine that the interacted and merged categories have higher mean asymmetries than the isolated category, with a larger separation between the categories' $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ distributions than between their $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ distributions. For the interacted and merged categories, we find an inverse correlation between baryonic mass and $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ that is not observed between baryonic mass and $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$. These results, coupled with the weak correlation found between $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$, highlight the limitations of only using $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ to infer the HI distributions of spatially unresolved HI detections.</description>

      <title>Estimating Fe and Mg Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxies Using Subaru/HSC and DEIMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical abundance distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Ursa Minor, and Draco dwarf galaxies using Subaru/HSC photometric data. The HSC dataset, which includes broadband g and i filters and the narrowband NB515 filter, offers sensitivity to iron and magnesium abundances as well as surface gravity, enabling the identification of giant stars and foreground dwarfs. For analysis, we selected a total of 6713 giant candidates using a Random Forest regressor trained on medium-resolution (R ~ 6000) Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals the extent of radial metallicity gradients in the galaxies. Such trends, not detectable in earlier studies, are now captured owing to the substantially enlarged sample size and areal coverage provided by the HSC data. These results are also consistent with chemical abundance patterns previously observed in the central regions through spectroscopic studies. Furthermore, we infer that Fornax underwent extended star formation, whereas Sculptor formed both metal-poor and metal-rich stars over a shorter time. Ursa Minor and Draco appear to have experienced brief, intense star formation episodes leading to nearly extinguished star formation. This study underscores the critical role of the expanded HSC dataset in revealing chemical gradients that were previously inaccessible. Future work incorporating additional spectra of metal-poor stars and age-sensitive isochrone modeling will enable more accurate maps of chemical abundance distributions.</description>

      <title>Detailed analysis of multi-line molecular distributions in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068: Possible effect of the AGN outflow to the starburst ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines of the nearby type-2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 obtained by Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to objectively visualize the features of its center, (1) within a radius of about 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5; hereafter the "overall region") and (2) the ring shaped starburst region between 750 pc ($\sim$ 10") and 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5) of the galaxy (hereafter the "SB ring region"). PCA is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique that extracts key information through dimensionality reduction. The PCA results for the overall region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and difference of volume density and/or chemical composition between the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the starburst ring (SB ring). Additionally, the PCA results for the SB ring region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and distinction between starburst dominated region and shock dominated region. Furthermore, the PCA results for the SB ring region indicate a possible interaction between the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) outflow and gas in the SB ring. Although further investigation is required, we suggest that the AGN outflow interacts with gas in the SB ring, as this feature is consistent with the direction of the AGN outflow and is contributed by CN, C$_2$H and HCN, which are known to be enhanced by the AGN outflow. These results demonstrate that PCA can effectively extract features even for galaxies with complex structures, such as AGN + SB ring. This study also implies that PCA has the potential to uncover previously unrecognized phenomena by visualizing latent structures in multi-line data.</description>

      <title>A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for In Situ Massive Star Formation Beyond the Optical Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce. Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31, making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an ~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154 thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Identifying Ring Galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of ring structures in galaxies are crucial for understanding the nature and distribution of dark matter, galactic interactions, and the internal secular evolution of galaxies. However, the limited number of existing ring galaxy catalogs has constrained deeper exploration in this field. To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage binary classification model based on the Swin Transformer architecture to identify ring galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This model first selects potential candidates and then refines them in a second stage to improve classification accuracy. During model training, we investigated the impact of imbalanced datasets on the performance of the two-stage model. We experimented with various model combinations applied to the datasets of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR9, processing a total of 573,668 images with redshifts ranging from z_spec = 0.01-0.20 and magr &lt;17.5. After applying the two-stage filtering and conducting visual inspections, the overall Precision of the models exceeded 64.87%, successfully identifying a total of 8052 newly discovered ring galaxies. With our catalog, the forthcoming spectroscopic data from DESI will facilitate a more comprehensive investigation into the formation and evolution of ring galaxies.</description>

      <title>CNN-Derived Elemental Abundances of LAMOST DR10 Giants: Implications for Galactic Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar parameters and abundances provide crucial insights into stellar and Galactic evolution studies. In this work, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate stellar parameters: effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$), surface gravity (log $g$) and metallicity (both [Fe/H] and [M/H]) as well as six $\alpha$-elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca) and [$\alpha$/M]. We selected giant stars with \( 3500 \, \text{K} &lt; T_{\text{eff}} &lt; 5500 \, \text{K} \) and \( 0 \, \text{dex} &lt; \log g &lt; 3.6 \, \text{dex} \) from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys, while requiring (S/N)$_g$ of the LAMOST low-resolution spectra $&gt;$ 10, which leaves 1,100,858 giant stars. The spectral from LAMOST and the labels from APOGEE for 62,511 common stars were used as our training set. The corresponding test set yields scatters 50 K, 0.06 dex and 0.13 dex for $T_{\text{eff}}$, [Fe/H] and log $g$, respectively. For $\alpha$ elements O, Mg, Si and Ca, the scatters are 0.05 dex, 0.04 dex, 0.03 and 0.04 dex, respectively. For C and N elements, the scatters are 0.07 dex and 0.05 dex. For [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H], the scatters are 0.03 dex and 0.06 dex. The mean absolute error (MAE) of most elements are between 0.02 $-$ 0.04 dex. The predicted abundances were cross-matched with previously identified substructures PG1 and PG2, with their origins subsequently analyzed. Finally, the catalog is available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101529/.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a steeper SMBH-Bulge mass relationship extended to low masses using TDE host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are excellent tools for probing low mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that may otherwise remain undetected. Here, we present an extended SMBH--Bulge mass scaling relationship using these lower mass TDE black holes and their host galaxies. Bulge masses are derived using Prospector fits to UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 40 TDEs that have a detected late-time UV/optical plateau emission, from which a SMBH mass is derived. Overall, we find that TDE plateaus are a successful method for probing BH scaling relations. We combine the observed TDE sample with a higher mass SMBH sample and extend the known relationship, recovering a steeper slope ($m = 1.34 \pm 0.03$) than current literature estimates, which focus on the high mass regime. For the TDE only sample, we measure an equally significant but shallower relationship with a power-law slope of $m = 1.17 \pm 0.10$ and significance $&lt;0.001$. Forward modelling is used to determine whether known selection effects can explain both the comparatively flatter TDE only relation and the overall steepening across the full SMBH mass range. We find that the flattening at TDE masses can be accounted for, however the steepening can not. It appears that if a single slope extends for the whole BH mass range, it must be steeper to include the TDE population.</description>

Abstract: We present the first band-2 (120 - 250 MHz) uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 1644 (z = 0.0471), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of the northern (A1644N) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N exhibits a synchrotron power law spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron self-absorption. X-ray analysis reveals two shock fronts at the southern substructure with a Mach number $M= 3.21 \pm 0.51$ and $M= 2.22 \pm 0.07$, indicating an ongoing merger. Our findings reinforce the complex dynamical nature of Abell 1644 and contribute to a deeper understanding of the cluster's thermodynamic state. Future deep radio observations with improved radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation will be crucial for probing non-thermal phenomena in this system.</description>

      <title>Can AI Dream of Unseen Galaxies? Conditional Diffusion Model for Galaxy Morphology Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets -- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features ( $\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical foundation model developments.

      <title>The Radio Spectral Energy Distribution and Star Formation Calibration in MIGHTEE-COSMOS Highly Star-Forming Galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of distant galaxies is essential for understanding their assembly and evolution over cosmic time. We present rest-frame radio SEDs of a sample of 160 starburst galaxies at redshifts 1.5 to 3.5 in the COSMOS field, as part of the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) project. MeerKAT observations, combined with archival VLA and GMRT data, allow us to determine the integrated mid-radio (1-10 GHz) continuum (MRC) luminosity and magnetic field strength. A Bayesian method is used to model the SEDs and separate free-free and synchrotron emission. We calibrate the star formation rate (SFR) in radio both directly through SED analysis and indirectly via the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). With a mean synchrotron spectral index of approximately 0.7, we find that the index flattens with redshift and specific SFR, suggesting that cosmic rays are more energetic in the early universe due to higher star formation activity. The magnetic field strength increases with redshift (B is proportional to (1 + z)^0.7) and with star formation rate (B is proportional to SFR^0.3), indicating a small-scale dynamo as the dominant amplification mechanism. Accounting for SED evolution, the IRRC remains redshift-invariant and does not vary with stellar mass at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, though the correlation deviates from linearity. Similarly, we show that SFR estimates based on integrated MRC luminosity are also redshift-invariant.</description>

      <title>Tracing Dark Matter in the Central Regions of Galaxy Clusters Using Galaxies, Gas, and Intracluster Light in TNG300: Connections to Cluster Dynamical State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of intracluster light (ICL) as a dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding cluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total mass $M_{\rm tot}&gt;10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions of dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as dark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\rm vir}&lt;0.3$. We apply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the similarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of the galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the spatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely resemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more relaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results demonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark matter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to mass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark matter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.</description>

      <title>A Bimodal Metallicity Distribution Function in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Reticulum II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $M_* &lt;10^5M_\odot$) is suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after reionization.</description>

      <title>Taking a Break at Cosmic Noon: Continuum-selected Low-mass Galaxies Require Long Burst Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational limitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass galaxies ($M_\star &lt; 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1&lt;z&lt;3$), uniformly selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by 20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the galaxies' H$\alpha$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations to synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($\gtrsim 100$ Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($\gtrsim 0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population--at least those within our detection limits--should not be classified solely by their current star formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing dynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star formation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Galactic echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>Star Formation and Magnetic Field Amplification due to Galactic Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use global MHD galaxy simulations to investigate the effects of spiral arms on the evolution of magnetic fields and star formation within a self-regulated interstellar medium (ISM). The same galaxy is simulated twice: once with self-consistent stellar spiral arms and once more with the stellar spirals suppressed via a novel numerical approach, using the Ramses AMR code. Spiral arms continually promote star formation, with 2.6 times higher rates in the spiral galaxy. The higher rate is due to high gas columns gathered along the spiral arms, rather than increasing the star formation efficiency at a given gas column. In both cases, the magnetic field is initially amplified via a small-scale dynamo driven by turbulence due to supernova feedback. Only the spiral galaxy exhibits late-time, consistent field growth due to a large-scale dynamo (e-folding time $\sim600$ Myr). This results in volume-averaged field strengths of $\sim 1$ $\mu$G after 1 Gyr of evolution. The mean-fields tend to align themselves with the spiral arms and are coherent up to 10 kpc scales. We demonstrate a novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, whereby spiral-driven radial flows enable the mean-field amplification.</description>

      <title>Realistic consecutive galaxy mergers form eccentric PTA sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs. We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an eccentricity e&gt;0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary formation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv) triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which hasn't yet reached coalescence.</description>

      <title>Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</description>

      <title>Project AMIGA: The Inner Circumgalactic Medium of Andromeda from Thick Disk to Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies, where disk and halo processes intersect, remains poorly characterized despite its critical role in regulating galaxy evolution. We present results from Project AMIGA Insider, mapping Andromeda's (M31) inner CGM within 0.25 R_vir (~75 kpc) using 11 QSO sightlines, bringing our total sample to 54 sightlines from the disk to 2 R_vir. We detect a clear transition between M31's thick disk and CGM at R &lt; 30 kpc, where low/intermediate ions show thick-disk corotating components with higher column densities than the CGM ones, while high ions exhibit similar column densities in both the CGM and thick disk. Beyond this region, all ion column densities decrease with impact parameter, with steeper gradients for low ions than high ions. The inner CGM (R &lt; 100 kpc) shows more complex gas phases and multi-component absorption compared to the predominantly single-component outer CGM. We find no significant azimuthal dependence for any observed ions, suggesting M31's CGM is shaped by radial processes (e.g., cooling flows, precipitation) rather than disk-aligned outflows. We estimate the total metal mass in M31's cool (SiII, SiIII, SiIV) CGM within R_vir to be (1.9+/-0.3_stat+/-0.7_sys)x10^7 M_sun, leading to a cool gas mass of approximately 6x10^9 (Z/0.3 Z_sun)^-1 M_sun. The warmer OVI gas may contain at least 10 times more metal and gas mass. Compared to the COS-Halos L* galaxies, M31's cool CGM shows lower Si column densities at R &lt; 0.4 R_200 and lower cool CGM masses, possibly resulting from M31's higher halo mass or different environments.</description>

      <title>Shockingly Effective: Cluster Winds as Engines of Feedback in Starburst Galaxy VV 114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU spectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous starburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution data allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a broad emission line component ($\sigma_{\rm{broad}} \sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$) with line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by stars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to shocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface number density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles around clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds driven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power estimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy deposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that at least 70\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star clusters. \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging reveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of the shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there is a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \emph{Chandra} soft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The energy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic power of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the starburst.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Intracluster Light and Brightest Cluster Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Intracluster Light (ICL) is a faint stellar component of galaxy groups and clusters bound to the cluster potential, and making up a significant fraction of the cluster mass. ICL formation and evolution is strongly linked to the Brightest Cluster Galaxies of clusters. Aims. To compare the properties and progenitor galaxies of the Intracluster Light (ICL) and Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) of clusters and groups at redshift z = 0, and determine how they coevolve. Methods. We select 127 clusters and groups in the hydrodynamic Illustris-TNG100 simulation above a mass of $10^{13} M_\odot$. We divide the ICL from the BCG by applying a surface brightness cut at the Holmberg radius of 26.5 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$, where star particles within this radius are defined as being attached to the BCG, and outside, the ICL. We then study the properties and formation history of the ICL and BCG. Results. We find the ICL is generally composed of material from stripped or merged intermediate mass galaxies, with a smaller in-situ component, while the BCG is composed of more massive merged galaxies and has a larger in-situ fraction. The ICL mass fraction increases weakly with cluster mass, declines with concentration and increases with time since the BCGs most recent major merger. The ICL is bluer and more metal-poor than the BCG, but there is no significant difference in the age of the material. Universally, BCG+ICL systems have negative colour and metallicity gradients. The ICL and BCG share a high fraction of progenitor galaxies, but the most significant progenitor is frequently not shared. Conclusions. ICL properties and formation are tied to the formation histories of the host cluster and BCG, and thus their properties are individual to each system. Although the ICL and BCG coevolve, they have distinct formation histories and properties.</description>

      <title>High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of the G333 giant molecular cloud complex : III. Decomposition of molecular clouds into multi-scale hub-filament structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO (3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios. Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in our previous studies.</description>

      <title>Expansion Signatures in 35 HII Regions traced by SOFIA [CII] Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the expansion signatures of 35 HII regions mapped in [CII] 158 micron emission by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The [CII] emission primarily traces photodissociation regions (PDRs) at the transition between ionized and neutral gas. The brightness and narrow linewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions often exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the 35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV) diagrams, making them expansion candidates (ECs), with an average expansion velocity of ~12.2 km/s. The remaining 23 regions show no clear expansion signatures, though they may still be expanding below detection limits. Blueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one redshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and ~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical expansion models supports expansion in eight of 12 ECs. Estimated dynamical ages are 10 to 100 times shorter than the ionizing star lifetimes, in agreement with the results of previous studies. Of the 35 regions, 14 (~40%) appear as [CII] bubbles; nine of the 12 ECs are bubble-shaped. Thermal pressure likely drives expansion in M43, while stellar winds dominate in M17, M42, RCW 120, and RCW 79. For other ECs, available data do not allow a definitive conclusion. Larger samples and more information about ionizing sources are needed to refine our understanding of HII region feedback and evolution.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of the mass density profile of dense molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is $\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow) or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally, under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with $\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds are two nearby dwarf irregular galaxies whose study can help us in understanding galaxy and stellar evolution. In particular, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the larger one, contains approximately 30 billion stars at various evolutionary stages. In this work, we present an SDSS $gri$-bands photometric analysis based on multiple images acquired with DECam, the Dark Energy Camera, installed on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile). We performed a full image analysis and photometric calibration, resulting in a photometric catalog named COSMIC-L, consisting of 57,997,665 stars, of which 18,676,294 contain estimates for all three $gri$ magnitudes, resulting in a completeness magnitude of $\simeq 21$ and a limiting magnitude of $\simeq 22$ in all three bands.</description>

      <title>Impact of the large-scale cosmic web on the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot circumgalactic medium (CGM), probed by X-ray observations, plays a central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness (XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} &gt;10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the impact of the environment on X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>High resolution radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on large-scale radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) that led to the definite detection of five young stars and the tentative detection of five more. As in other regions surveyed in the radio domain, the majority of detected sources are fairly evolved low-mass T Tauri stars, but we also detect one protostellar object (Ced 110 IRS4) and one Herbig Ae/Be star. With the exception of the protostellar source, the radio emission mechanism is likely of non-thermal origin. The three brightest radio stars identified with ATCA were subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one, J11061540-7721567 (Ced 110 IRS2), was detected at three epochs. This confirms the non-thermal nature of the radio emission in that specific case, and enabled accurate radio position measurements. Comparison with predictions from Gaia DR3 strongly suggests that this star is a binary system with an orbital period of order 40 years; additional LBA observations in the next decades would enable accurate determinations of the individual stellar masses in that system.</description>

      <title>The Modeling Landscape of Extragalactic CO in CMB Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150, and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.</description>

      <title>Testing Light Unaffiliated Mass Clumps in MACS 0416 on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2 remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2. Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps. The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences for DM being associated with light in clusters.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space density of moderate-luminosity, obscured AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe, however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z&gt;6, until now. We present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11 directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN, at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred. These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$; correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities. Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Metallicity Effects in Hot Jupiter Occurrence Across Galactic Birth Radius and Phase-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius (\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\ $\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$ per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $&lt; 5$ kpc arise from survey selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$ sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity (0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics studies.</description>

      <title>10,000 Resolved Triples from Gaia: Empirical Constraints on Triple Star Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Insights gained from the Light Echo of Cepheus A HW2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cepheus A HW2 is a well-studied massive young stellar object (MYSO) featuring Class II methanol masers. Recently, certain maser components have been found to flare every five years. This period went undetected in (NEO)WISE photometry due to detector saturation. However, difference imaging revealed a light echo (LE), representing a variability record. Its periodicity is similar to that of the masers. Thereby, the mid-IR light curve since 2007 could be reconstructed. Phase and period maps provide information on the circumstellar dust distribution and viewing geometry. This is the first time an LE has been used for reverberation mapping of a YSO environment and expanding its light curve into the past.</description>

      <title>The PGPUC horizontal branch evolutionary tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizontal branch (HB) phase of stellar evolution plays a critical role in understanding the life cycle of stars, particularly in the context of low-mass stars. However, generating theoretical evolutionary tracks for HB stars is computationally intensive, especially when attempting to match a wide range of observational data. This work presents an extensive grid of HB evolutionary tracks computed using the PGPUC code, covering a broad range of chemical compositions, progenitor masses, and alpha-element distributions. The aim is to provide a robust tool for interpreting HB stellar populations and advancing our understanding of their diverse properties. The evolutionary tracks are made publicly available through the PGPUC Online database for easy access and interpolation. We computed over 19,000 HB evolutionary tracks encompassing a wide range in terms of mass, metallicity, helium abundance, and alpha-element enhancement, along with different progenitor masses. Using these tracks, we calculated zero-age, middle-age, and terminal-age loci. The PGPUC database now includes a fine grid of HB evolutionary tracks, allowing for precise interpolation. Key findings include the dependence of HB morphology on progenitor mass, metallicity, and helium abundance.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVII: A Compact but Structured Keplerian Disk and Large-scale Streamers Revealed in the Class I Protostellar System IRAS 04169+2702</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\sim$0.05"; 8 au) dust continuum and molecular line observations toward the Class I protostellar system IRAS 04169+2702 in the Taurus B213 region, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3-mm dust continuum emission traces a circumstellar disk with a central depression toward the protostar. Our VLA observations of the same target reveal a single central peak dominated by the free-free emission, which coincides with the depression of the thermal dust emission. The mean spectral index of the thermal dust emission from 1.3 mm to 1.4 cm is approximately 2.8, suggestive of the presence of grains grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes in the disk. Velocity gradients along the disk major axis are seen in emission from $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), and C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ protostar, as well as an infalling and rotating envelope with the angular momentum conserved. In addition to the compact disk, large-scale infalling spiral structures extending up to approximately 1400 au, streamers, are discovered in C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0, 3}$-2$_{0, 2}$) as well as in the 1.3-mm continuum emission. Notably, in the region closer to the protostar, the spatial coincidence of C$^{18}$O and SO may indicate the presence of a shock related to accretion through the spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals in Galactic Centers for FIRE simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission, viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes (Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio 1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle. We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However, we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do not produce the expected signal.</description>

      <title>CosmoGLINT: Cosmological Generative Model for Line Intensity Mapping with Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo -- conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation, the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Navigating AGN variability with self-organizing maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
  Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting classifications.
  Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the ability to identify different AGNs types.
  Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge. In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected. These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>Infalling Ultra Faint Dwarfs as Emissaries of the Axiverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of Ultra Faint dwarf galaxies (UFG's) infalling onto the Milky Way, namely Leo K \&amp; M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the case that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller, fainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of multiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of $3\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \&amp; M, whereas a lighter axion of $10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including the dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its velocity dispersion to be smaller $\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\simeq 4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty Principle to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing residuals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and 4 months, respectively.</description>

      <title>Shadow in the Galactic Center: Theoretical Concept -- Prediction -- Realization</title>

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole binary merger: properties and astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Dynamical Friction: a Numerical Study of Extended Perturbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of momentum and energy transfer between a massive body and a background medium it is moving through is known as dynamical friction (DF). It is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian meshless finite mass hydrodynamics solver, the moving-mesh MUSCL scheme, and the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) solver. We use a set of simulations of massive bodies, modelled as Plummer spheres, moving with Mach $0.2 \leq \mathcal{M} \leq 3$. We investigate at which radial distances from the perturber these solvers recover the linear point mass solution for gaseous DF. We analyse the drag force and the structure and time evolution of the wake. The different solvers agree closely. Numerical convergence is reached when the initial spatial resolution is $0.2r_s$, where $r_s$ is the softening scale of the Plummer sphere. We find that the wake structure and drag force are recovered, at the $5\%$ level, when compared beyond $4r_\mathrm{s}$. Our results predict that models using the standard linear point mass DF solution will overestimate the drag force on extended perturbers by as much as 25\%, for Mach$\sim$1. Finally, we consider DF in the context of galaxy clusters, where dark matter subhaloes move through circumgalactic media. We show that DF is typically in the linear regime for most subhaloes in hosting haloes $&lt;10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ but non-linear in more massive host haloes.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution in Nuclear Stellar Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear Stellar Discs (NSDs) have been observed in the vast majority of barred disc galaxies including the Milky Way. Their intense star formation is sustained by the intense gas inflows driven by their surrounding bars and frequently supports a large-scale galactic fountain. Despite their central role in galaxy evolution, their chemical evolution remains largely unexplored. We argue that the chemical composition of NSDs is best understood relative to the bar tips from which their gas is drawn. We make predictions of the detailed abundance profiles of gas and young stars within the NSD under different accretion scenarios from the galactic bar. We present the first systematic, multizonal modelling of the chemical evolution of nuclear stellar discs based on the RAMICES II code. We show that due to their different star formation history to galactic discs, NSDs offer a unique laboratory to break parameter degeneracies in chemical evolution models. This allows us to identify the effects of the main parameters guiding NSD nucleosynthesis and disentangle them from the global enrichment history. We also show for two edge cases how the mode of gas accretion onto the NSD imprints on the gas abundance profiles and make predictions that can be tested with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions computed by Cloudy in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) value importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere, with errors $\gtrsim 10$ times smaller than for the interpolation table of Gnedin and Hollon (2012). We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.</description>

      <title>Simulating intermediate black hole mass measurements for a sample of galaxies with nuclear star clusters using ELT/HARMONI high spatial resolution integral-field stellar kinematics</title>

Abstract: Understanding the demographics of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^2-10^5$ M$_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies is key to constraining black hole seed formation models, but detecting them is challenging due to their small gravitational sphere of influence (SOI). The upcoming ELT/HARMONI instrument, with its high angular resolution, offers a promising solution. We present simulations assessing HARMONI's ability to measure IMBH masses in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) of nearby dwarf galaxies. We selected a sample of 44 candidates within 10 Mpc. For two representative targets, NGC 300 and NGC 3115 dw01, we generated mock HARMONI integral-field data cubes using realistic inputs derived from \hst\ imaging, stellar population models, and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM), assuming IMBH masses up to 1\% of the NSC mass. We simulated observations across six NIR gratings at 10 mas resolution. Analyzing the mock data with standard kinematic extraction (pPXF) and JAM models in a Bayesian framework, we demonstrate that HARMONI can resolve the IMBH SOI and accurately recover masses down to $\approx 0.5\%$ of the NSC mass within feasible exposure times. These results highlight HARMONI's potential to revolutionize IMBH studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a kinematic and spectroscopic analysis of 40 red giant branch stars, in 9 fields, exquisitely delineating the lower segment of the North West Stream (NW-K2), which extends for $\sim$80 kpc from the centre of the Andromeda galaxy. We measure the stream's systemic velocity as -439.3$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}$ km/s with a velocity dispersion = 16.4$^{+5.6}_{-3.8}$ km/s that is in keeping with its progenitor being a dwarf galaxy. We find no detectable velocity gradient along the stream. We determine $-$1.3$\pm$0.1 $\le$ &lt;[Fe/H]$_{\rm spec}$&gt; $\le$ $-$1.2$\pm$0.8 but find no metallicity gradient along the stream. We are able to plausibly associate NW-K2 with the globular clusters PandAS-04, PandAS-09, PAndAS-10, PAndAS-11, PandAS-12 but not with PandAS-13 or PandAS-15 which we find to be superimposed on the stream but not kinematically associated with it.</description>

      <title>One Stream or Two -- Exploring Andromeda's North West Stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of our dynamical stream modelling for the North West Stream in the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Comprising two main segments, the North West Stream was thought to be a single structured arching around M31. However, recent evidence suggests that it is two separate, unrelated, streams. To test this hypothesis we use observational data from 6 fields associated with the upper segment of the North West Stream together with 8 fields and 5 globular clusters associated with the lower segment to constrain model orbits. We fit both segments of the stream using a fixed potential model for M31 and an orbit integrator to compare orbits with the observed streams. We measure the central tracks and predict proper motions for for the upper segment (lower segment) finding ${\mu^*_{\alpha}}$ = 0.078$^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ (0.085$^{+0.001}_{-0.002}$) mas/yr and ${\mu_{\delta}}$ = $-$0.05$^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$ ($-$0.095$^{+0.003}_{-0.005}$) mas/yr. Our results support the hypothesis that the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XXVII is the progenitor of the upper segment of the North West Stream and that the upper and lower segments do not comprise a single structure. We propose that the upper segment, which appears to be on an infall trajectory with M31, be renamed the "Andromeda XXVII Stream" and the lower segment, also apparently infalling towards M31, retain the name "North West Stream".</description>

      <title>A theoretical investigation of far-infrared fine structure lines at $z&gt;6$ and of the origin of the [OIII]88/[CII]158 enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>Understanding Stellar Mass-Metallicity and Size Relations in Simulated Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reproducing the physical characteristics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) in cosmological simulations is challenging, particularly with respect to stellar metallicity and galaxy size. To investigate these difficulties in detail, we conduct high-resolution simulations ($M_{\rm gas} \sim 60 \, M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm DM} \sim 370 \, M_{\odot}$ ) on six UFD analogs ($M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^8 - 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm \star} \sim 10^3 - 2.1 \times 10^4 \, M_{\odot}$). Our findings reveal that the stellar properties of UFD analogs are shaped by diverse star-forming environments from multiple progenitor halos in the early Universe. Notably, our UFD analogs exhibit a better match to the observed mass-metallicity relation (MZR), showing higher average metallicity compared to other theoretical models. The metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) of our simulated UFDs lack high-metallicity stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -2.0$) while containing low-metallicity stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &lt; -4.0$). Excluding these low-metallicity stars, our results align well with the MDFs of observed UFDs. However, forming stars with higher metallicity ($-2.0 \leq [\rm Fe/H]_{\rm max} \leq -1.5$) remains a challenge due to the difficulty of sustaining metal enrichment during their brief star formation period before cosmic reionization. Additionally, our simulations show extended outer structures in UFDs, resulting from dry mergers between progenitor halos. To ensure consistency, we adopt the same fitting method commonly used in observations to derive the half-light radius. We find that this method tends to produce lower values compared to direct calculations and struggles to accurately describe the extended outer structures. To address this, we employ a two-component density profile to obtain structural parameters, finding that it better describes the galaxy shape, including both inner and outer structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of active galactic nucleus jets on kiloparsec-scales due to their interaction with the clumpy interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy and, subsequently, the surrounding circumgalactic environment. Hydrodynamic simulations of this jet-environment interaction are presented for a range of jet kinetic powers, peak densities of the multiphase ISM, and scale radii of the larger-scale environment -- characteristic of either a galaxy cluster or poor group. Synthetic radio images are generated by considering the combination of synchrotron radiation from the jet plasma and free-free absorption from the multiphase ISM. We find that jet propagation is slowed by interactions with a few very dense clouds in the host galaxy ISM, producing asymmetries in lobe length and brightness which persist to scales of tens of kpc for poor group environments. The classification of kiloparsec-scale jets is highly dependent on surface brightness sensitivity and resolution. Our simulations of young active sources can appear as restarted sources, showing double-double lobe morphology, high core prominence (CP &gt; 0.1), and the expected radio spectra for both the inner- and outer-lobe components. We qualitatively reproduce the observed inverse correlation between peak frequency and source size, and find that the peak frequency of the integrated radio spectrum depends on ISM density but not the jet power. Spectral turnover in resolved young radio sources therefore provides a new probe of the ISM.</description>

      <title>On the Use of WGANs for Super-Resolution in Dark-Matter Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution techniques have the potential to reduce the computational cost of cosmological and astrophysical simulations. This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) model, previously proposed in the literature, to increase the particle resolution of dark-matter-only simulations. We reproduce prior results, showing the WGAN model successfully generates high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true high-resolution simulations. However, we also identify a limitation of the WGAN model in the form of smeared features in generated high-resolution data, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos and filaments. This limitation points to a potential weakness of the proposed WGAN-based super-resolution method in capturing the detailed structure of halos, and underscores the need for further development in applying such models to cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the accreted stellar halos of low-mass field galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the properties of stellar halos in galaxies of present-day virial mass $10^8 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ by combining the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, the COCO cosmological N-body simulation, and the STINGS particle tagging technique. Galaxies in low mass halos have a wide range of stellar halo properties. Their diversity is much greater at fixed stellar mass than fixed virial mass. In the least massive DM halos capable of supporting galaxy formation, accreted mass fractions are &lt; 10 per cent, and the typical density profile of accreted stars is similar to that of stars formed in situ. In low mass galaxies, the radial scale lengths of accreted stellar halos are smaller than those of stellar disks formed in situ, but the accreted component is still diffuse, not bulge-like. At the scale of galaxies like M33, the surface density of accreted stars exceeds that of the in situ component at ~15kpc; the accreted surface density at this radius is $3.5\lesssim \log_{10} M_\star/{\rm M_\odot} \mathrm{kpc^{-2}} \lesssim 6$, varying systematically with virial mass. We compare our predictions to observations and other cosmological simulations. A small but significant number of $\sim 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ halos with exceptionally inefficient star formation -- "failed Milky Ways" -- are more prominent in our model than others; the true abundance of this population is a potential constraint on galaxy formation physics and could be measured by low surface brightness surveys targeting field galaxies with M33-like stellar mass. The stellar particle data for our simulation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Population III star formation continues until the end of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift $z \approx 15$ due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift $z=3$. The high mass resolution of up to $142 M_\odot$ per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from $10^6 M_\odot$ to $10^9 M_\odot$ until the end of reionization at around $z=5$. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Measuring Scaling Relationships: Fitting Technique Matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling relationships, both integrated and spatially resolved, arise due to the physical processes that govern galaxy evolution and are frequently measured in both observed and simulated data. However, the accuracy and comparability of these measurements are hindered by various differences between studies such as spatial resolution, sample selection criteria, and fitting technique. Here, we compare variations of standard least squares techniques to the ridge line method for identifying spatially resolved scaling relations ($\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, $\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, and $\Sigma_{\rm gas}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) for TNG100 galaxies. We find that using the ridge line technique to fit these scaling relations with a double linear function results in significantly better fits than fitting with ordinary least squares. We further illustrate the utility of the ridge line technique with an investigation into the dependence of rSFMS measurements on spatial resolution and smoothing scale. Specifically, we find that the slope of the rSFMS at low-$\Sigma_*$ is independent (within $2\sigma$) of spatial resolution and smoothing scale. Finally, we discuss the need for a consistent re-analysis of resolved scaling relations in the literature and physically motivate adoption of the ridge line technique over other fitting methods.</description>

      <title>Massive black hole formation in Population III star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that challenge existing black hole (BH) formation models. These newly observed BHs seem overmassive compared to the host galaxies and have an unexpectedly high abundance. Their exact origin remains elusive. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the formation of massive BH seeds in dense Population III (Pop III) star clusters. Using a cosmological simulation of Pop III cluster formation, we present models for the assembly and subsequent evolution of these clusters. The models account for background gas potential, stellar collisions and associated mass loss, gas accretion, stellar growth, their initial mass function (IMF), and subsequent star formation. We conduct $N$-body simulations of these models over a span of 2 million years. Our results show that BHs of $&gt; 400$ M$_\odot$ are formed in all cases, reaching up to $\sim 5000$ M$_\odot$ under optimistic yet reasonable conditions and potentially exceeding 10$^4$ M$_\odot$ provided that high accretion rates of 10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ onto the stars can be sustained. We conclude that massive BHs can be formed in Pop III stellar clusters and are likely to remain within their host clusters. These BHs may experience further growth as they sink into the galaxy's potential well. This formation channel should be given further consideration in models of galaxy formation and BH demographics.</description>

      <title>The competing effects of recent and long-term star formation histories on oxygen, nitrogen, and stellar metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) - the three-way trend between galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs) and gaseous metallicities - remains amongst the most studied extragalactic relations. Furthermore, metallicity correlates particularly tightly with gravitational potential. Simulations support a shared origin for these relations relating to long-term gas inflow history variations; however, differences between simulated and observed galaxy samples make it unclear whether this holds for real galaxies. We use MaNGA integral field observations to probe these relations in star-forming galaxies at one effective radius. We confirm the FMR and equivalent relations for stellar metallicity (FMR*) and gaseous N/O (fundamental nitrogen relation, FNR). We find that all relations persist when considering gravitational potential in place of stellar mass and/or considering stellar ages in place of SFR, with the gaseous relations strengthened significantly by considering potential. The gaseous FMR disappears at high masses/potentials, while the FNR persists and the FMR* strengthens. Our results suggest a unified interpretation of galaxies' gaseous and stellar metallicities and their N/O abundances in terms of their formation histories. Deeper gravitational potentials correspond to earlier star-formation histories (SFHs) and faster gas consumption, producing tight potential-abundance relations for stars and gas. In weak potentials, galaxy SFR variations primarily result from recent gas inflows, mostly affecting gas abundances. In deeper potentials, SFR variations instead correspond to broad differences in SFH shapes resulting from differences in long-term gas consumption histories, which is most visible in stellar abundances. This unified interpretation could be confirmed with upcoming higher redshift spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Leo I: the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the highest dark-matter density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are known for being strongly dominated by dark matter (DM), which makes them convenient targets for investigating the DM nature and distribution. Recently, renewed interest in the dSph Leo I has resulted from claims suggesting the presence of a central supermassive black hole (BH), with mass estimates that challenge the typical expectations for dSphs, which are generally thought to host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). However, Pascale et al. 2024 presented new upper limits on the BH mass, which are consistent with the range for IMBHs, solving the concerns raised in previous studies. Building on the analysis of Pascale et al. 2024, we examine the DM properties of Leo I inferred from the dynamical models of that paper. Our results indicate that Leo I is the galaxy with the highest DM density among the classical dSphs, with a central DM density (measured at a distance of $150$ pc from the galaxy centre) $\rho_{150}=35.5_{-4.7}^{+3.8}\times10^7\,M_\odot\,$kpc$^{-3}$. The DM density profile has logarithmic slope $\gamma_{150}=-0.89_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$ at $150$ pc, in line with literature values. At smaller distances the DM distribution flattens into a core, with a core radius of $r_c=72^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. Combined with the small pericentric distance of Leo I's orbit in the Milky Way, the new estimate of $\rho_{150}$ makes Leo I decisive in the study of the anticorrelation between pericentre and central DM density, and suggests that the anticorrelation could be significantly steeper and more pronounced than previously estimated. Despite its DM dominance, Leo I does not emerge as the most favorable target for indirect DM detection: the inferred DM decay $D$ and annihilation $J$ factors, $\log D(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV cm$^{-2}$] = $17.94_{-0.25}^{+0.17}$ and $\log J(0.5^{\circ})$ [GeV$^2$ cm$^{-5}$]= $18.13_{-0.18}^{+0.17}$ are consistent with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>The ejection and detectability of high- and hyper-velocity stars by compact object binaries in globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo $N$-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected $\sim$6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which $839_{-67}^{+70}$ have present-day velocities exceeding $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$. Using mock photometric observations, we find that $290_{-23}^{+28}$ ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only $1_{-1}^{+2}$ stars faster than $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.</description>

      <title>Observing the launch of an Eddington wind in the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The luminous narrow line Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 was the first non-BAL AGN to reveal a powerful ionized wind, based on early observations with ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory. Subsequent observations, mainly with XMM-Newton and the Japanese Suzaku Observatory, found such winds to be a common feature of luminous AGN. Typical outflow velocities of v ~ 0.1c and flow momenta mv ~ L_Edd /c are consistent with winds being launched by continuum driving from a disc when the local mass accretion rate is super-Eddington. Here we report the launch of a new, ultra-fast outflow component in PG1211+143, near the end of a 5-week XMM-Newton observing campaign, and discuss its origin in an ultra-fast {\it inflow} detected some 3 weeks earlier. We note that the inflow lasted for at least 3 days and delivered at least 10 Earth mass of fresh material into the innermost region of the source. While this mass by itself is insufficient to cause a complete inner disc restructuring - a prediction supported by lack of change in simultaneous UV fluxes - we suggest that a ring of matter at R ~ 20 R_g, located via its gravitational redshift (Pounds and Page 2024), was subsequently accreted, leading to the launch of a new outflow at a velocity of v ~ 0.27c.</description>

      <title>A new "temperature inversion" estimator to detect CMB patchy screening by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons imprints various properties of the baryons around galaxies on the CMB. One such imprint, called patchy screening, is a direct probe of the gas density profile around galaxies. It usefully complements the information from the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and does not require individual redshifts. In this paper, we derive new estimators of patchy screening called the "temperature inversion" (TI) and "signed" estimators, analogous to the gradient inversion estimator of CMB lensing. Pedagogically, we clarify the relation between these estimators and the standard patchy screening quadratic estimator (QE). The new estimators trade optimality for robustness to biases caused by the dominant CMB lensing and foreground contaminants, allowing the use of smaller angular scales. We perform a simulated analysis to realistically forecast the expected precision of patchy screening measurements from four CMB experiments, ACT, SPT, Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4, cross-correlated with three galaxy samples from BOSS, unWISE and the simulated Rubin LSST Data Challenge 2 catalog. Our results give further confidence in the first detection of this effect from the ACT$\times$unWISE data in the companion paper and show patchy screening will be a powerful observable for future surveys like SO, CMB-S4 and LSST. Implementations of the patchy screening QE and the TI and signed estimators are publicly available in our LensQuEst and ThumbStack software packages, available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst and https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/ThumbStack , respectively.</description>

      <title>Testing Strong Gravitational Lensing Effects of Supermassive Black Holes with String-Inspired Metric: Observational Signatures and EHT Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing in the strong field limit for spherically symmetric string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes, characterized by magnetic charge ($q$) and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton coupling constants ($\alpha, \beta$) from the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory. Our results show that the string coupling has a weak impact on the positions of relativistic images, deflection angles, photon orbit radii, and shadow sizes, making these black holes indistinguishable from the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black holes with the same mass and charge. Compared to Schwarzschild black holes, the string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes exhibit smaller deflection angles, decreasing with increasing charge. Moreover, the time delay for Sgr A * and M87 * can reach $~11.477$ and $~17349.8$ minutes, respectively, at $q=0.1$ and $\eta=-1$, deviating from Schwarzschild black holes by $~0.0198$ and $~28.9$ minutes, which are not very significant. For Sgr A* and M87*, we determine $\theta_\infty$ range within $(11.52, 26.33)~\mu as$, and $(9.17, 19.78)~\mu as$ respectively, with angular separations $s$ ranging from $(3.29-6.85)~nas$ for Sgr A* and $(2.47-5.15)~nas$ for M87*. EHT bounds on the $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ interval bound the $q$ as: for Sgr A* $0.54109\le q \le 0.7796 $ and for M87* $0&lt; q \le 0.29107$, while in both the cases, we did not find any bound on the parameter $\eta$. We show that string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg black holes and EHT observations agree in the finite parameter space. A discussion on the effective metric has been included.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter haloes in Two-field Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a compelling candidate for dark matter, offering a natural explanation for the structure of diffuse low-mass haloes. However, the canonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in reproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly scenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of multiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue. The theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the fact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum exist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper, we consider the axiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the two-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an unprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the diverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time. Depending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes can host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Black holes: An Explanation for the Galaxy Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of increasing observational evidence supporting the existence of ultra-compact objects, we adopt the term astrophysical black hole to refer to any object having a huge mass confined within a sufficiently small region of spacetime. This terminology encompasses both the classical black hole solutions predicted by general relativity, as well as alternative compact objects that may not possess an event horizon. We propose models of Astrophysical Black holes (ABHs) without event horizons (EHs), as a more viable explanation for the long-term quenching phenomenon in galaxies. At the same time, the short-term quenching is explained here in terms of an efficient feedback expected in the models of stellar-mass astrophysical black holes (StMABHs). We have calculated the radiative flux from the disk in a general spherically symmetric metric background and used it to contrast the distinctive features of the BHs and ABHs scenarios. We demonstrate the relative ease of wind generation from the accretion disk surrounding an ABH without an event horizon, compared to a BH, and highlight the significant strength of these winds. The nature of the feedbacks arising from accretion onto a BH and an ABH in the `quasar' and `radio' modes are compared and some possible observational signatures of the StMABHs are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>
