      <description>arXiv:2408.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study weighted sum processes associated to elements in a Wiener chaos with fixed order. More precisely we give H{\"o}lder estimates and weak convergences of them. Main tools we will use are the integration by parts formula in Malliavin calculus and the fourth moment theorem.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings and Lozenge Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct perfect t-embeddings for regular hexagons of the hexagonal lattice, providing the first example, and hence proving existence, for graphs with an outer face of degree greater than four. The construction is in terms of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix and relies only on symmetries of the graph. Using known formulas for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, we derive exact contour integral formulas for these embeddings and their origami maps. Through steepest descent analysis, we establish scaling limits, proving convergence of origami maps to a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$, and we verify structural rigidity conditions, leading to a new proof of convergence of height fluctuations to the Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Branching random walk conditioned on large martingale limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a branching random walk in the non-boundary case where the additive martingale $W_n$ converges a.s. and in mean to some non-degenerate limit $W_\infty$. We first establish the joint tail distribution of $W_\infty$ and the global minimum of this branching random walk. Next, conditioned on the event that the minimum is atypically small or conditioned on very large $W_\infty$, we study the branching random walk viewed from the minimum and obtain the convergence in law in the vague sense. As a byproduct, we also get the right tail of the limit of derivative martingale.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions for single death processes with killing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the quasi-stationary distributions for a single death process (or downwardly skip-free process) with killing defined on the non-negative integers, corresponding to a non-conservative transition rate matrix. The set $\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$ constitutes an irreducible class and $0$ is an absorbing state. For the single death process with three kinds of killing term, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the quasi-stationary distribution. Moreover, we derive the conditions for exponential convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution in the total variation norm. Our main approach is based on the Doob's $h$-transform, potential theory and probabilistic methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one dimensional Littlewood-Offord problem for general Ising models. More precisely, consider the concentration function \[Q_n(x,v)=P(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\varepsilon_iv_i\in(x-1,x+1)),\] where $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ are real numbers such that $|v_1|\geq 1, |v_2|\geq 1,\ldots, |v_n|\geq 1$, and $(\varepsilon_i)_{i=1,2,\ldots,n}$ are spins of some Ising model. Let $Q_n=\sup_{x,v}Q_n(x,v)$. Under natural assumptions, we show that there exists a universal constant $C$ such that for all $n\geq 1$, \[\binom{n}{[n/2]}2^{-n}\leq Q_n\leq Cn^{-\frac{1}{2}}.\]</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration: Order versus Anti-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix Markov inequality by Ahlswede2001 was stated using the Loewner anti-order between positive definite matrices. Wang2024 use this to derive several other Chebyshev and Chernoff-type inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein, empirical Bernstein) in the Loewner anti-order, including self-normalized matrix martingale inequalities. These imply upper tail bounds on the maximum eigenvalue, such as those developed by Tropp2012 and howard2020time. The current paper develops analogs of all these inequalities in the Loewner order, rather than anti-order, by deriving a new matrix Markov inequality. These yield upper tail bounds on the minimum eigenvalue that are a factor of d tighter than the above bounds on the maximum eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for subgraph count in random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-uniform and inhomogeneous random hypergraph model is considered, which is a straightforward extension of the celebrated binomial random graph model $\mathbb G(n, p)$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for small hypergraph count to be asymptotically normal, and complement them with convergence rate in both the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances. Next we narrow our attention to the homogeneous model and relate the obtained results to the fourth moment phenomenon. Additionally, a short proof of necessity of aforementioned conditions is presented, which seems to be absent in the literature even in the context of the model $\mathbb G(n, p)$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Volume Bounds Under Hypercube Translations and Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds for the Gaussian volume of the Minkowski sum \(\Omega + K_a\), where \(\Omega\) is any Borel set and \(K_a\) represents the vertices of a hypercube with edge length \(2a\). For \(a = c/\sqrt{\ln n}\), we show that if \(c &lt; \pi/\sqrt{2}\), then the volume remains close to that of \(\Omega\). Conversely, if \(c &gt; \pi\), we construct a domain \(\Omega\) for which the volume of the sum is significantly less than that of \(\Omega\). These results extend to generalized hypercubes, providing precise volume bounds based on the sparsity ratio of the vertices used in the translations. The findings have implications for adversarial hypothesis testing, particularly in scenarios where an adversary, after observing a Gaussian random vector, perturbs a subset of its components by a fixed magnitude.</description>

      <title>A distance theorem for inhomogenous random rectangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (n - d)}$ be a random matrix with independent uniformly anti-concentrated entries satisfying $\mathbb{E}\lvert A\rvert_{HS}^2 \leq Kn(n-d)$ and let $H$ be the subspace spanned by $H$. Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a random vector with uniformly anti-concentrated entries. We show that when $1 \leq d \leq \lambda n/\log n$ the distance between between $X$ and $H$ satisfies the following following small ball probability estimate:
  \[
  \Pr\left( \text{dis}(X,H) \leq t\sqrt{d} \right)
  \leq (Ct)^{d} + e^{-cn},
  \]
  for some constants $\lambda,c,C &gt; 0$. This extends the distance theorems of Rudelson and Vershynin, Livshyts, and Livshyts,Tikhomirov, and Vershynin by dropping any identical distribution assumptions about the entries of $X$ and $A$. Furthermore it can be applied to prove numerous results about random matrices in the inhomogenous setting. These include lower tail estimates on the smallest singular value of rectangular matrices and upper tail estimates on the smallest singular value of square matrices. To obtain a distance theorem for inhomogenous rectangular matrices we introduce a new tool for this new general ensemble of random matrices, Randomized Logarithmic LCD, a natural combination of the Randomized LCD, used in study of smallest singular values of inhomogenous square matrices, and of the Logarithmic LCD, used in the study of no-gaps delocalization of eigenvectors and the smallest singular values of Hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions to 3D stochastic magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the 3D stochastic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations driven by additive noise on torus. For arbitrarily prescribed divergence-free initial data in $L^{2}_x$, we construct infinitely many probabilistically strong and analitically weak solutions in the class $L^{r}_{\Omega}L_{t}^{\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$, where $r&gt;1$ and $(s, \gamma, p)$ lie in a supercritical regime with respect to the the Lady\v{z}henskaya-Prodi-Serrin (LPS) criteria. In particular, we get the non-uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions, which is sharp at one LPS endpoint space. Our proof utilizes intermittent flows which are different from those of Navier-Stokes equations and derives the non-uniqueness even in the high viscous and resistive regime beyond the Lions exponent 5/4. Furthermore, we prove that as the noise intensity tends to zero, the accumulation points of stochastic MHD solutions contain all deterministic solutions to MHD solutions, which include the recently constructed solutions in [28, 29] to deterministic MHD systems.</description>

      <title>Mixing on Generalized Associahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eppstein and Frishberg recently proved that the mixing time for the simple random walk on the $1$-skeleton of the associahedron is $O(n^3\log^3 n)$. We obtain similar rapid mixing results for the simple random walks on the $1$-skeleta of the type-$B$ and type-$D$ associahedra. We adapt Eppstein and Frishberg's technique to obtain the same bound of $O(n^3\log^3 n)$ in type $B$ and a bound of $O(n^{13} \log^2 n)$ in type $D$; in the process, we establish an expansion bound that is tight up to logarithmic factors in type $B$.</description>

Abstract: This thesis explores the historical progression and theoretical constructs of financial mathematics, with an in-depth exploration of Stochastic Calculus as showcased in the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and the Continuous-Time Models. A comprehensive survey of stochastic calculus principles applied to option pricing is offered, highlighting insights from Peter Carr and Lorenzo Torricelli's ``Convex Duality in Continuous Option Pricing Models". This manuscript adopts techniques such as Monte-Carlo Simulation and machine learning algorithms to examine the propositions of Carr and Torricelli, drawing comparisons between the Logistic and Bachelier models. Additionally, it suggests directions for potential future research on option pricing methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (SLLBar) equation with pure jump noise in Marcus canonical form, which describes the dynamics of magnetic spin field in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures with the effective field $\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{eff}}$ influenced by external random noise. Under the natural assumption that the magnetic body $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$) is bounded with smooth boundary, we shall prove that the initial-boundary value problem of SLLBar equation possesses a unique global probabilistically strong and analytically weak solution with initial data in the energy space $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O})$. Then by employing the weak convergence method, we proceed to establish a Freidlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle for pathwise solutions to the SLLBar equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of global solutions to the Cauchy problem for a coupled stochastic chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system with multiplicative L\'{e}vy noises in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The existence of global martingale solutions is proved under a framework that is based on the Faedo-Galerkin approximation scheme and stochastic compactness method, where the verification of tightness depends crucially on a novel stochastic version of Lyapunov functional inequality and proper compactness criteria in Fr\'{e}chet spaces. A pathwise uniqueness result is also established with suitable assumption on the jump noises, which indicates that the considered system admits a unique global strong solution.</description>

      <title>M\"obius inversion and the bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating nonlinear functionals of probability distributions from samples is a fundamental statistical problem. The "plug-in" estimator obtained by applying the target functional to the empirical distribution of samples is biased. Resampling methods such as the bootstrap derive artificial datasets from the original one by resampling. Comparing the outcome of the plug-in estimator in the original and resampled datasets allows estimating and thus correcting the bias. In the asymptotic setting, iterations of this procedure attain an arbitrarily high order of bias correction, but finite sample results are scarce. This work develops a new theoretical understanding of bootstrap bias correction by viewing it as an iterative linear solver for the combinatorial operation of M\"obius inversion. It sharply characterizes the regime of linear convergence of the bootstrap bias reduction for moment polynomials. It uses these results to show its superalgebraic convergence rate for band-limited functionals. Finally, it derives a modified bootstrap iteration enabling the unbiased estimation of unknown order-$m$ moment polynomials in $m$ bootstrap iterations.</description>

      <title>Iterative Improvement of an Additively Regularized Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic modelling is fundamentally a soft clustering problem (of known objects -- documents, over unknown clusters -- topics). That is, the task is incorrectly posed. In particular, the topic models are unstable and incomplete. All this leads to the fact that the process of finding a good topic model (repeated hyperparameter selection, model training, and topic quality assessment) can be particularly long and labor-intensive. We aim to simplify the process, to make it more deterministic and provable. To this end, we present a method for iterative training of a topic model. The essence of the method is that a series of related topic models are trained so that each subsequent model is at least as good as the previous one, i.e., that it retains all the good topics found earlier. The connection between the models is achieved by additive regularization. The result of this iterative training is the last topic model in the series, which we call the iteratively updated additively regularized topic model (ITAR). Experiments conducted on several collections of natural language texts show that the proposed ITAR model performs better than other popular topic models (LDA, ARTM, BERTopic), its topics are diverse, and its perplexity (ability to "explain" the underlying data) is moderate.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Estimates for Markov Transition Matrices with Rigorous Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for the classical Maximal Likelihood Estimation of the transition matrix of a given Markov chain. Meanwhile, in the reversible case, we propose a new reversibility-preserving online Symmetric Counting Estimation of the transition matrix with non-asymptotic deviation bounds. Our analysis is based on a convergence study of certain Markov chains on the length-2 path spaces induced by the original Markov chain.</description>

      <title>On bivariate lower semilinear copulas and the star product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the family $\mathcal{C}^{LSL}$ of all bivariate lower semilinear (LSL) copulas first introduced by Durante et al. in 2008 and, using the characterization of LSL copulas in terms of diagonals with specific properties, derive several novel and partially unexpected results. In particular we prove that the star product (also known as Markov product) $S_{\delta_1}*S_{\delta_2}$ of two LSL copulas $S_{\delta_1},S_{\delta_2}$ is again a LSL copula, i.e., that the family $\mathcal{C}^{LSL}$ is closed with respect to the star product. Moreover, we show that translating the star product to the class of corresponding diagonals $\mathcal{D}^{LSL}$ allows to determine the limit of the sequence $S_\delta, S_\delta*S_\delta, S_\delta*S_\delta*S_\delta,\ldots$ for every diagonal $\delta \in \mathcal{D}^{LSL}$. In fact, for every LSL copula $S_\delta$ the sequence $(S_\delta^{*n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to some LSL copula $S_{\overline{\delta}}$, the limit $S_{\overline{\delta}}$ is idempotent, and the class of all idempotent LSL copulas allows for a simple characterization. Complementing these results we then focus on concordance of LSL copulas. After deriving simple formulas for Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ we study the exact region $\Omega^{LSL}$ determined by these two concordance measures of all elements in $\mathcal{C}^{LSL}$, derive a sharp lower bound and finally show that $\Omega^{LSL}$ is convex and compact.</description>

      <title>Reinsurance with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>On differentiability and mass distributions of typical bivariate copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that copulas are commonly considered as analytically smooth/regular objects, derivatives of copulas have to be handled with care. Triggered by a recently published result characterizing multivariate copulas via $(d-1)$-increasingness of their partial derivative we study the bivariate setting in detail and show that the set of non-differentiability points of a copula may be quite large. We first construct examples of copulas $C$ whose first partial derivative $\partial_1C(x,y)$ is pathological in the sense that for almost every $x \in (0,1)$ it does not exist on a dense subset of $y \in (0,1)$, and then show that the family of these copulas is dense. Since in commonly considered subfamilies more regularity might be typical, we then focus on bivariate Extreme Value copulas (EVC) and show that a topologically typical EVC is not absolutely continuous but has degenerated discrete component, implying that in this class typically $\partial_1C(x,y)$ exists in full $(0,1)^2$. Considering that regularity of copulas is closely related to their mass distributions we then study mass distributions of topologically typical copulas and prove the surprising fact that topologically typical bivariate copulas are mutually completely dependent with full support. Furthermore, we use the characterization of EVCs in terms of their associated Pickands dependence measures $\vartheta$ on $[0,1]$, show that regularity of $\vartheta$ carries over to the corresponding EVC and prove that the subfamily of all EVCs whose absolutely continuous, discrete and singular component has full support is dense in the class of all EVCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.05720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for stochastic differential equations driven by semimartingales, with additive controls. Conditions are given in terms of characteristics of driven semimartingales, so that if the noise-control pairs satisfy a large deviation principle with some good rate function, so do the solution processes. There is no joint exponential tightness assumption for noise-control-solution triplets and no uniform exponential tightness assumption for noise.</description>

      <title>From Monte Carlo to neural networks approximations of boundary value problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study probabilistic and neural network approximations for solutions to Poisson equation subject to Holder data in general bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We aim at two fundamental goals.
  The first, and the most important, we show that the solution to Poisson equation can be numerically approximated in the sup-norm by Monte Carlo methods, and that this can be done highly efficiently if we use a modified version of the walk on spheres algorithm as an acceleration method. This provides estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation error and with polynomial complexity in the dimension and the reciprocal of the error. A crucial feature is that the overall number of samples does not not depend on the point at which the approximation is performed.
  As a second goal, we show that the obtained Monte Carlo solver renders in a constructive way ReLU deep neural network (DNN) solutions to Poisson problem, whose sizes depend at most polynomialy in the dimension $d$ and in the desired error. In fact we show that the random DNN provides with high probability a small approximation error and low polynomial complexity in the dimension.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for the two urn model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the generalized P\'olya urn model containing two urns and we study the number of balls $B_j(n)$ of a given color $j\in\{1,\ldots,J\}$, $J\in\mathbb{N}$ added to the urns after $n$ draws. We provide sufficient conditions under which the random variables $(B_j(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ properly normalized and centered converge weakly to a limiting random variable. The result reveals a similar trichotomy as in the classical case with one urn, one of the main differences being that in the scaling we encounter 1-periodic continuous functions. Another difference in our results compared to the classical urn models is that the phase transition of the second order behavior occurs at $\sqrt{\rho}$ and not at $\rho/2$, where $\rho$ is the dominant eigenvalue of the mean replacement matrix.</description>

Abstract: A model for the evolution of a large population interacting system is considered in which a marked Poisson processes influences their evolution, together with a Brownian motion. Mean field McKean-Vlasov limits of such system are formulated studying first both systems individually. Letting the population size growing to infinite, the weak convergence of the solutions of such systems is proved; in other words, propagation of chaos of such systems is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by $$ \mathscr{L}_{\epsilon}f= {b} \cdot \nabla f + \epsilon \Delta f $$ for some smooth vector field $ b\colon \mathbb R^d \to\mathbb R^d$ and a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$. Consider the initial-valued problem $$ \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_ t u_\epsilon = \mathscr L_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon (0, \cdot) = u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. $$ for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Denote by $\mathcal M_0$ the set of critical points of $b$ which are stable stationary points for the ODE $\dot x (t) = b (x(t))$. Under the hypothesis that $\mathcal M_0$ is finite and $ b = -(\nabla U + \ell)$, where $ \ell$ is a divergence-free field orthogonal to $\nabla U$, the main result of this article states that there exist a time-scale $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon$, $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to \infty$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, and a Markov semigroup $\{p_t : t\ge 0\}$ defined on $\mathcal M_0$ such that $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (t\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon, x)
  =\sum_{m'\in \mathcal M_0} p_t(m, m')\, u_0( m'), $$ for all $t&gt;0$ and $ x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the ODE $\dot{x}(t)= b( x(t))$. The time scale $\theta^{(1)}$ is critical in the sense that, for all time scale $\varrho_\epsilon$ such that $\varrho_\epsilon \to \infty$, $\varrho_\epsilon/\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to 0$, $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (\varrho_\epsilon, x)=u_0(m) $$ for all $x \in \mathcal D(m)$. Namely, $\theta_\epsilon^{(1)}$ is the first scale at which the solution to the initial-valued problem starts to change. In a companion paper [Landim, Lee, Seo, forthcoming] we extend this result finding all critical time-scales at which the solution $u_\epsilon$ evolves smoothly in time and we show that the solution $u_\epsilon$ is expressed in terms of the semigroup of some Markov chain taking values in sets formed by unions of critical points of $b$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a transient Brownian motion reflected obliquely in a two-dimensional wedge. A precise asymptotic expansion of Green's functions is found in all directions. To this end, we first determine a kernel functional equation connecting the Laplace transforms of the Green's functions. We then extend the Laplace transforms analytically and study its singularities. We obtain the asymptotics applying the saddle point method to the inverse Laplace transform on the Riemann surface generated by the kernel.</description>

Abstract: For the one dimensional Burgers equation with a random and periodic forcing, it is well-known that there exists a family of invariant measures, each corresponding to a different average velocity. In this paper, we consider the coupled invariant measures and study how they change as the velocity parameter varies. We show that the derivative of the invariant measure with respect to the velocity parameter exists, and it can be interpreted as the steady state of a diffusion advected by the Burgers flow</description>

      <title>On the area between a L\'evy process with secondary jump inputs and its reflected version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic properties of the area under some function of the difference between (i) a spectrally positive L\'evy process $W_t^x$ that jumps to a level $x&gt;0$ whenever it hits zero, and (ii) its reflected version $W_t$. Remarkably, even though the analysis of each of these areas is challenging, we succeed in attaining explicit expressions for their difference. The main result concerns the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the integral $A_x$ of (a function of) the distance between $W_t^x$ and $W_t$ until $W_t^x$ hits zero. This result is extended in a number of directions, including the area between $A_x$ and $A_y$ and a Gaussian limit theorem. We conclude the paper with an inventory problem for which our results are particularly useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine to leading order the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for Wigner matrices and $\beta$-ensembles. In the special case of Gaussian-divisible Wigner matrices, our method provides universality of the maximum up to tightness. These are the first universal results on the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjectures for these models, and in particular answer the question of optimal rigidity for the spectrum of Wigner matrices.
  Our proofs combine dynamical techniques for universality of eigenvalue statistics with ideas surrounding the maxima of log-correlated fields and Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio is a quantity used in the physics literature to differentiate between phases in lattice Higgs models. It is defined as the limit of a ratio of expectations of Wilson line observables as the length of these lines go to infinity while the parameters of the model are kept fixed. In this paper, we show that the Marcu-Fredenhagen ratio exists in all predicted phases of the model, and show that it indeed undergoes a phase transition. In the Higgs phase of the model we do a more careful analysis of the ratio to deduce its first order behaviour and also give an upper bound on its rate of convergence. Finally, we also present a short and concise proof of the exponential decay of correlations in the Higgs phase.</description>

Abstract: This note is devoted to a discussion of the potential links and differences between three topics: regularization by noise, convex integration, spontaneous stochasticity. All of them deal with the effect on large scales of a small-scale perturbation of fluid dynamic equations. The effects sometimes have something in common, like convex integration and spontaneous stochasticity, sometimes they look the opposite, as in regularization by noise. We are not aware of rigorous links or precise explanations of the differences, and hope to drive new research with this comparative examination.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the explicit expression for the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}^{X}(D)$ for a large class of compound Poisson processes $X$ on a bounded open set $D$ by examining its spectral heat content. When the jump density of the compound Poisson process is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing, we demonstrate that balls are the unique minimizers for $\lambda_{1}^{X}(D)$ among all sets with equal Lebesgue measure. Furthermore, we show that this uniqueness fails if the jump density is not strictly decreasing.</description>

      <title>Universality in Random Persistent Homology and Scale-Invariant Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a universality result for the limiting distribution of persistence diagrams arising from geometric filtrations over random point processes. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the ratio of persistence values (death/birth), and show that for fixed dimension, homological degree and filtration type (Cech or Vietoris-Rips), the limiting distribution is independent of the underlying point process distribution, i.e., universal. In proving this result, we present a novel general framework for universality in scale-invariant functionals on point processes. Finally, we also provide a number of new results related to Morse theory in random geometric complexes, which may be of an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bounds on some geometric functionals of high dimensional Brownian convex hulls and their inverse processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two-sided bounds on the expected values of several geometric functionals of the convex hull of Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their inverse processes. This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017), Jovaleki\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \v{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from the plane to higher dimensions. Our main result shows that the average time required for the convex hull in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to attain unit volume is at most $n\sqrt[n]{n!}$. The proof relies on a novel procedure that embeds an $n$-simplex of prescribed volume within the convex hull of the Brownian path run up to a certain stopping time. All of our bounds capture the correct order of asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.</description>

      <title>Uniform log-Sobolev inequalities for mean field particles with flat-convex energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to demonstrate uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for the mean field gradient particle systems associated to an energy functional that is convex in the flat sense. A defective log-Sobolev inequality was already established implicitly in a previous joint work with F. Chen and Z. Ren [arXiv:2212.03050 [math.PR]]. It remains only to tighten it by a uniform Poincar\'e inequality, which we prove by the method in a recent work of Guillin, W. Liu, L. Wu and C. Zhang [Ann. Appl. Probab., 32(3):1590-1614, 2022]. As an application, we show that the particle system exhibits the concentration of measure phenomenon in the long time.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for locally small increments of compound empirical processes with applications to solutions of compound and risk averse stochastical programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with concentration inequalities for locally small increments of compound empirical processes. In the asymptotic theory of $m$-estimation such inequalities play an essential role in deriving convergence rates for solutions of the sample average approximation method to solve compound stochastic programs, and in particular for $m$-estimators. We develop inequalities dependent on the sample sizes with explicit terms instead of unspecified universal constants. They are applied to study the Sample Average Approximation method for compound stochastic programs. Nonasymptotic upper estimates for the deviation probabilities of the optimal solutions are derived which are dependent on the sample sizes. They allow to conclude immediately convergence rates for the optimal solutions. In the special case of classical risk neutral stochastic programs, we end up with upper estimates of deviation probabilities for $m$-estimators, and their convergence rates. Moreover, we may also demonstrate how to apply the results to sample average approximation of risk averse stochastic programs. In this respect we consider stochastic programs expressed in terms of absolute semideviations and Average Value at Risk. The investigations are based on concentration inequalities from the recent contribution Kratschmer(2024).</description>

      <title>Random tensor networks with nontrivial links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random tensor networks are a powerful toy model for understanding the entanglement structure of holographic quantum gravity. However, unlike holographic quantum gravity, their entanglement spectra are flat. It has therefore been argued that a better model consists of random tensor networks with link states that are not maximally entangled, i.e., have nontrivial spectra. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of the entanglement properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A parametric approach to the estimation of convex risk functionals based on Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a static setting for the assessment of risk in the context of mathematical finance and actuarial science that takes into account model uncertainty in the distribution of a possibly infinite-dimensional risk factor. We allow for perturbations around a baseline model, measured via Wasserstein distance, and we investigate to which extent this form of probabilistic imprecision can be parametrized. The aim is to come up with a convex risk functional that incorporates a sefety margin with respect to nonparametric uncertainty and still can be approximated through parametrized models. The particular form of the parametrization allows us to develop a numerical method, based on neural networks, which gives both the value of the risk functional and the optimal perturbation of the reference measure. Moreover, we study the problem under additional constraints on the perturbations, namely, a mean and a martingale constraint. We show that, in both cases, under suitable conditions on the loss function, it is still possible to estimate the risk functional by passing to a parametric family of perturbed models, which again allows for a numerical approximation via neural networks.</description>

      <title>Computation of random time-shift distributions for stochastic population models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even in large systems, the effect of noise arising from when populations are initially small can persist to be measurable on the macroscale. A deterministic approximation to a stochastic model will fail to capture this effect, but it can be accurately approximated by including an additional random time-shift to the initial conditions. We present a efficient numerical method to compute this time-shift distribution for a large class of stochastic models. The method relies on differentiation of certain functional equations, which we show can be effectively automated by deriving rules for different types of model rates that arise commonly when mass-action mixing is assumed. Explicit computation of the time-shift distribution can be used to build a practical tool for the efficient generation of macroscopic trajectories of stochastic population models, without the need for costly stochastic simulations. Full code is provided to implement this and we demonstrate our method on an epidemic model and a model of within-host viral dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) in continuous time that is based on the strict no-arbitrage condition and that is applicable to both frictionless markets and markets with proportional transaction costs. We consider a market with a single risky asset whose ask price process is higher than or equal to its bid price process. Neither the concatenation property of the set of wealth processes, that is used in the proof of the frictionless FTAP, nor some boundedness property of the trading volume of admissible strategies usually argued with in models with a nonvanishing bid-ask spread need to be satisfied in our model.</description>

      <title>Mixed orthogonality graphs for continuous-time stationary processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce different concepts of Granger causality and contemporaneous correlation for multivariate stationary continuous-time processes to model different dependencies between the component processes. Several equivalent characterisations are given for the different definitions, in particular by orthogonal projections. We then define two mixed graphs based on different definitions of Granger causality and contemporaneous correlation, the (mixed) orthogonality graph and the local (mixed) orthogonality graph. In these graphs, the components of the process are represented by vertices, directed edges between the vertices visualise Granger causal influences and undirected edges visualise contemporaneous correlation between the component processes. Further, we introduce various notions of Markov properties in analogy to Eichler (2012), which relate paths in the graphs to different dependence structures of subprocesses, and we derive sufficient criteria for the (local) orthogonality graph to satisfy them. Finally, as an example, for the popular multivariate continuous-time AR (MCAR) processes, we explicitly characterise the edges in the (local) orthogonality graph by the model parameters.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and suppose that the distance between each pair of points is revealed independently with probability $p$. We study when this information is sufficient to reconstruct large subsets of $V$, up to isometry.
  Strong results for $d=1$ have been obtained by Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott. In this paper, we investigate higher dimensions, and show that if $p&gt;n^{-2/(d+4)}$, then we can reconstruct almost all of $V$ up to isometry, with high probability. We do this by relating it to a polluted graph bootstrap percolation result, for which we adapt the methods of Balogh, Bollob\'as, and Morris.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding approximate Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is explicitly identified in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. This is achieved by introducing a suitable linear derivative of the value functions with respect to unilateral deviations of strategies and via analyzing the sensitivity processes of state dynamics with respect to controls.
  For games with mean-field type interactions, $\alpha$ is shown to decay to zero as the number of players goes to infinity, even with heterogeneity in state dynamics, cost functions, and admissible strategy classes. For distributed games, if a static potential function can be derived from the cost functions, then $\alpha=0$. For crowd aversion games, $\alpha$ is capable of capturing the subtle difference between the choice of admissible strategies.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric bootstrap of high-dimensional sample covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new "$(m,mp/n)$ out of $(n,p)$" sampling-with-replace\-ment bootstrap for eigenvalue statistics of high-dimensional sample covariance matrices based on $n$ independent $p$-dimensional random vectors. In the high-dimensional scenario $p/n\rightarrow c\in (0,\infty)$, this fully nonparametric and computationally tractable bootstrap is shown to consistently reproduce the empirical spectral measure if $m/n\rightarrow 0$. If $m^2/n\rightarrow 0$, it approximates correctly the distribution of linear spectral statistics. The crucial component is a suitably defined Representative Subpopulation Condition which is shown to be verified in a large variety of situations. Our proofs are conducted under minimal moment requirements and incorporate delicate results on non-centered quadratic forms, combinatorial trace moments estimates as well as a conditional bootstrap martingale CLT which may be of independent interest.</description>
