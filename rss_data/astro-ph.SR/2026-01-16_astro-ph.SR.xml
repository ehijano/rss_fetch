      <title>Simulating the photospheric to coronal plasma using magnetohydrodynamic characteristics III: validation including gravity, flux emergence, and an eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar eruptions arise from instabilities or loss of equilibria in the solar atmosphere, but routinely inferring the precise magnetic and plasma properties that lead to eruptions is not currently practical using synoptic solar observations. Data driven simulations offer an appealing alternative. We test our boundary data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach, based on the method of characteristics, on a simulation that includes full MHD, a stratified atmosphere, and the emergence of a model solar magnetic active region, from the photosphere upwards. The driven simulation is tested against a larger, ab initio ``Ground Truth'' simulation that extends downward into the convection zone. Our driven simulation accurately reproduces the dynamic emergence of the active region above the photosphere, the formation of key topological features throughout the corona, and the subsequent eruption of mass and magnetic field. The total emerged energy matches to better than one percent, the ratio of emerged to eruptive energy is $\approx2\%$, and the actual values of each energy term agree to within $10\%$ between the two cases. Crucially, the data injection cadence, when properly scaled, matches the cadence of synoptic observations of the Sun's surface magnetic field, and is three to four orders of magnitude longer than the inherent CFL time step of the simulations. The stability of the code and fidelity of the results over an entire active region lifetime, from emergence to eruption, strongly suggests that our method will produce reliable results when driven using solar synoptic observations from existing and anticipated ground and spaced based observatories.</description>

      <title>Using rapid rotators as tracers of multiplicity statistics as a function of stellar density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have identified that rapidly rotating stars are predominantly binaries with separations of a few to a few tenths of au. This is a crucial range of separation that is often inaccessible to searches of binary stars, providing a unique opportunity to examine their statistical properties. In particular, we have performed an analysis of rapid rotators in young moving groups. We examined their fraction as a function of the stellar density of the population in which they are found. We find that there is a deficit of rapid rotators in dense clusters such as the Orion Nebula in comparison to the more diffuse parts of the Orion Complex, as intracluster interactions with neighboring stars likely dissolve binaries with intermediate separations before they had a chance to fully form. In contrast, in older populations with an age of $\sim100$ Myr, mass segregation redistributes binaries relative to single stars, thus in such older regions, rapid rotators are predominantly found in the regions of higher stellar density. This work sheds light on both the conditions that lead to the formation of binary stars and their dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Type II-P Supernova Progenitors with the Euclid and CSST Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal in supernova (SN) research is to identify and characterize their progenitors. However, this is very difficult due to the limited archival images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution required for direct progenitor detection and due to the circumstellar dust which often biases the estimate of their intrinsic parameters. This field will be revolutionized by Euclid and the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), which conduct deep, wide-field, high-resolution and multi-band imaging surveys. We analyze their detection capability by comparing the model magnitudes of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors with the detection limits under different conditions, and we estimate the annual detection rates with Monte-Carlo simulations. We explore how to recover the intrinsic properties of SN progenitors with the help of radiation transfer calculations in circumstellar dust. We find the optical and near-infrared filters of the Euclid and CSST are highly effective for detecting RSG progenitors. We predict that archival images from the completed 2 surveys will enable $\lesssim13$ (or 24) progenitor detections per year within the mass range of 8--16 (or 8--25)M_\odot, an order of magnitude higher than the current detection rate of $\sim1$ detection per year. In the presence of circumstellar dust, the emerging spectral energy distribution (SED) of the progenitor is mainly affected by the optical depth and is almost independent of dust temperature in the Euclid and CSST filters. Our mock tests demonstrate that one can derive the progenitor mass and dust optical depth simultaneously by fitting the observed SED over the 11 filters of the 2 surveys while fixing the dust temperature to a typical value. Euclid and CSST will significantly enlarge the sample of direct progenitor detections with accurate mass measurements, which is crucial to resolve the long-standing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>A Highly Magnetic Ultra Massive White Dwarf with a 23-minute Rotation Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physical characterization of TMTS J00063798+3104160 (J0006), a rapidly rotating,ultra-massive white dwarf (WD) identified in high-cadence light curves from the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS). A coherent 23-minute periodicity is detected in TMTS, TESS, and ZTF photometry. A time series of low-resolution spectra with the Keck-I 10 m telescope reveals broad, shallow hydrogen absorption features indicative of an extreme magnetic field and shows no evidence for radial-velocity variations. Atmospheric modeling yields a magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 250 MG, while Gaia astrometry and photometry imply a mass of 1.06 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$. A significant infrared excess is detected in the WISE W1 band and is well fitted by a 550 K blackbody, likely arising from residual material of a merger. We interpret the 23-minute photometric modulation as the rotation period of an isolated, massive WD formed likely through the merger of a double WD binary. With one of the shortest rotation periods known among candidate merger remnants and with constraints from a deep Einstein Probe X-ray nondetection, J0006 provides a rare and important observational window into the poorly explored intermediate stages of post-merger evolution.</description>

      <title>Cycle dependence of helioseismic oscillations above the acoustic cut-off frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helioseismic and recent asteroseismic observations reveal fine structure in the power spectrum with alternating peaks and troughs above the acoustic cut-off frequency. This structure is interpreted as the interference patterns of high-frequency acoustic waves excited in the solar interior and propagating into the atmosphere, known as pseudomodes. Pseudomodes exhibit clear solar-cycle variability, with frequency shifts that occur predominantly in anti-phase with the activity cycle, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This work investigates how the subsurface excitation source location and the photospheric acoustic cut-off frequency influence the formation, frequency distribution, and solar-cycle variability of pseudomodes. We employ an analytical Klein-Gordon subsurface cavity model, which is shown to act as an effective Fabry-P\'erot interferometer for high-frequency waves that experience constructive and destructive interference between the source location and the lower turning point. We derive an effective dispersion relation isolating the effects of the source location and photospheric cut-off on the pseudomode frequency. The model reproduces the observed peak-trough pseudomode spectrum for reasonable parameter values constrained by Bayesian MCMC best-fitting to GONG observations. We also find that solar-cycle-associated 11-year modulations of the source location result in anti-phase pseudomode frequency shifts, whereas similar cyclic variations in the cut-off frequency produce harmonic-dependent behaviour, yielding both in-phase and anti-phase shifts. As the acoustic cut-off and mode excitation relate to stratification and flows in the solar interior, the results highlight pseudomodes as a powerful diagnostic tool for changes in subsurface solar and stellar structure through the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic follow-up of Gaia alerted Young Stellar Object variables: the Large Binocular Telescope view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed optical/near-IR Large Binocular Telescope spectra of 16 sources alerted by Gaia between 2021 and 2024 due to significant photometric variability. Half of the spectra were taken during quiescence and the rest during a burst or at intermediate brightness. Our analysis of their ten-year light curves and photometric/spectroscopic features provide evidence that all 16 sources are accreting Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). One object, Gaia23bab, is a known EXor source. Other light curves either have peaks over a stable baseline, or significant variability throughout the entire observation period, suggesting multiple contributing processes. All spectra exhibit emission lines from accretion columns, and over half of them show atomic forbidden lines as signatures of outflowing gas. We determined stellar parameters, accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) at different brightness phases. Only two sources showed variability primarily due to extinction. During quiescence, our sources exhibit Lacc and Macc values typical of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBE) sources, supporting the hypothesis that any YSO may undergo episodic accretion. In bursts, the Lacc and Macc of sources with photometric variations exceeding 2 mag follow a shallower relation with stellar luminosity and mass, typical of known EXor sources. This group includes one Class I, one flat-spectrum, and two Class II sources. Notably, the other Class I source, Gaia24beh, shows an Lacc value about ten times higher than typical EXor bursts of the same mass. In the other cases, Lacc and Macc align with variability seen in T Tauri and HAEBE sources.</description>

      <title>Shock Signatures of the Successive Type-II Solar Radio Bursts at Meter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successive type-II solar radio bursts observed on 31 July 2012 by the Bruny Island Radio Spectrometer (BIRS) in the frequency range between 62 - 6 MHz is reported and analyzed. The first type-II radio burst shows clear fundamental and harmonic band structures, while only one band is observed for the second type-II radio burst and is considered as the harmonic band. The first type-II radio burst is observed in the frequency range of 57 - 27 MHz between 00:03 - 00:09 UT at the harmonic band. The second type-II burst is observed between 00:18 - 00:27 UT in the frequency range of 43 - 17 MHz. The type-II radio bursts are associated with a C6 class flare located at the south-eastern limb (S24E87) and a CME observed from STEREO and LASCO observations. The EUVI signatures of the CME is observed in the ST-B EUVI FOV between 23:56 (on 30 July 2012) to 00:06 UT (on 31 July 2012), and are observed in the ST-B COR1 FOV between 00:10 - 00:35 UT moving within an average speed of 725 + or - 101 km/s. The CME is observed in the LASCO C2 FOV after 00:12 UT as a partial halo CME moving with an average speed of 486 km/s. The height-time plot shows that the first type-II radio burst was formed by the CME-shock along the shock front and the second type-II radio burst along the shock-dip structure, probably the dip structure results from the shock transiting across the high dense streamer structure. The successive type-II bursts are most likely produced by the single CME shock and their interactions with the streamer structures. The first type-II radio burst by the CME shock and the second type-II radio burst by the CME shock-streamer interactions.</description>

      <title>HST Observations of HD 166620 and Tau Ceti: First UV Spectra of a Magnetic Grand Minimum Star and the Extent of Tau Ceti's Astrosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra of the K2 V star HD 166620, the first star clearly recognized to be in a "magnetic grand minimum" state analogous to the Sun's "Maunder Minimum" in the late 1600's. The stellar H I Lyman-alpha surface fluxes are extremely low, about a factor of two below fluxes observed during solar minimum, and also significantly lower than those of Tau Ceti (G8 V) and HD 191408 (K2.5 V), two stars more similar to HD 166620 in spectral type and age (~10 Gyr) than the Sun. The Tau Ceti data that are compared with HD 166620 include both old archival data and a new HST observation as well. The Lyman alpha data are used to confirm a nondetection of astrospheric Lyman-alpha absorption for this star, suggesting a very weak wind with Mdot&lt;0.1 Mdot_sun. The very compact astrosphere inferred for Tau Ceti indicates that the star's debris disk is at least partly exposed to the ISM, and we discuss possible consequences.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity stellar extinction with Gaia and APOGEE -- I. The method and a new extinction curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-fidelity extinction measurements remains a bottleneck in deriving accurate stellar properties from Gaia parallaxes. In this work, we aim to derive precision extinction estimates for APOGEE DR19 stars, establishing a new benchmark for Galactic stellar population studies. We first determine reddening by comparing observed colorsr, etrieved from photometric surveys or standardized synthetic magnitudes from Gaia BP/RP spectra, to intrinsic colors predicted via an XGBoost model. The model is trained on minimally reddened stars to infer intrinsic colors and their associated uncertainties, using APOGEE stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]). The derived reddening values are then converted into extinctions using an anchor ratio of A_BP / A_RP = 1.694 +/- 0.004, derived from red-clump-like stars. Here, we provide extinction measurements in 39 filters across 10 photometric systems and introduce a new empirical extinction curve optimized for broadband passbands. Our extinction estimates (Av) outperform existing results (Bayestar19, StarHorse, SEDEX), achieving a typical precision of 0.03 mag in Av. Notably, we identify systematic deviations of up to 30% between monochromatic and passband-integrated extinction ratios at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. This result highlights the necessity of adopting passband-specific coefficients when correcting extinction to derive stellar parameters. As the foundation for a forthcoming series of papers, these benchmark measurements will be used to (1) revise asteroseismic scaling relations, (2) calibrate differential reddening in open clusters, and (3) reconcile heterogeneous dust maps into a unified, all-sky extinction scheme.</description>

      <title>WEAVE imaging spectroscopy of NGC 6720: an iron bar in the Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of the planetary nebula NGC 6720, the Ring Nebula, taken during the science verification phase of WEAVE, a new instrument mounted on the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma. We use the instrument's Large Integral Field Unit (LIFU) to obtain spectra of the Ring Nebula, covering its entire optically bright inner regions as well as parts of its much fainter outer molecular halo. We report the discovery of emission from [Fe~{\sc v}] and [Fe~{\sc vi}] confined to a narrow ``bar'' extending across the central regions of the nebula. No lines of other elements share this morphology or, at the spectral resolving power used ($R \sim 2500$), the same radial velocity. The extent to which iron in this bar is depleted is presently unclear; comparison with JWST-detected dust continuum emission suggests that some dust grain destruction may be occurring in the region, but there is currently no observational evidence for the $&gt;$ 50~km\,s$^{-1}$ shock waves or $T &gt; 10^6$~K X-ray emitting gas needed to enable this. Where the bar is located along the line of sight through the nebula, and how it was created, are new puzzles to be solved for this iconic planetary nebula.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Coronal Magnetic Field with 2D Coronal Seismology: A Forward-Modeling Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a two-dimensional (2D) coronal seismology technique applied to spectral-imaging data from the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) and UCoMP has enabled routine measurement of the global coronal magnetic field. The technique combines coronal transverse wave phase speed from Doppler measurements with electron densities from the Fe \sc{xiii}\rm{} 10798/10747 \AA\ intensity ratio to infer the magnetic field strength, while the wave propagation directions from Doppler measurements trace the magnetic field direction. To validate the accuracy and robustness of this method, we use forward modeling of a MURaM simulation that produces open and closed magnetic structures with excited waves. From the synthetic Doppler velocity, Fe \sc{xiii}\rm{} infrared line intensities, and linear polarization signals, we apply the 2D coronal seismology technique to estimate the magnetic field strength and direction. A comparison with the simulation ground truth shows close agreement, indicating that the technique can recover the line-of-sight emissivity-weighted magnetic field direction and strength with high accuracy. We also perform a parameter-space analysis to quantify sensitivities of the method to parameter choice. These findings provide practical guidance for CoMP/UCoMP-like analysis and demonstrate that 2D coronal seismology can deliver reliable, LOS emissivity-weighted measurements of the coronal magnetic field from coronal wave observations.</description>

      <title>MHD modelling of open flux evolution around solar maximum by coronal model COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate impact of temporal evolution and commonly used harmonic filtering of magnetograms, and the empirically defined oversimplified heating source terms on open-field distributions, we use a series of hourly-updated magnetograms, preprocessed by the 10th- and 50th-order filtered PF solvers, to drive COCONUT, configured with different heating prescriptions, to mimic coronal evolutions during CRs 2282 and 2283. We evaluate the simulated open magnetic flux at 1.01~$R_s$, 3~$R_s$, and 0.1~AU, and compare them with interplanetary observations. The results show that the simulated unsigned open flux evaluated near the solar surface can be comparable to that derived from interplanetary in situ observations. However, in low corona, numerous small-scale closed-field magnetic structures introduce magnetic polarity inversion interfaces within the open field, cancelling part of the open field near these interfaces during the volume-integration procedure of the finite-volume method. Consequently, the simulated unsigned open flux can be reduced by up to 45% at 0.1~AU and decreases more rapidly in the low corona. The results also indicate that moderate adjustments to the heating source term can effectively regulate the magnitude of the unsigned open magnetic flux. Preprocessing the initial magnetogram by a PF solver with limited spherical harmonics can reduce the open flux in the low corona and alter the distribution of open-field regions, but has little effect on the total unsigned open flux at larger heliocentric distances. The ratio of the maximum to minimum open unsigned magnetic flux can reach 1.4 within a single solar maximum CR. These findings highlight the necessity of considering finer grid resolution around magnetic polarity inversion interfaces, more realistic heating mechanisms, and the time-evolving regime of MHD coronal modelling when further addressing the ``open flux problem".</description>

      <title>The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.</description>

      <title>HR-GO II: chemical abundances of low-$E$ retrograde dynamically-tagged-groups: Revealing Thamnos as a very metal-poor substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Milky Way halo substructures identified in dynamical space are known to suffer from contamination from the Milky Way in-situ stars, which makes their accreted origins uncertain. We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $\alpha$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Apsidal Motion in Non-Synchronous Binary Pulsars Coupled Orbit and Spin Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apsidal motion of a non-synchronous binary pulsar serves as a valuable probe of relativistic gravity, stellar stricture, and dynamical evolution of close binary systems, In this study, we investigate the combined influence of general relativity, stellar oblateness and tidal interaction on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars: 1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002. Zahn's tidal equations \cite{1977A&amp;A....57..383Z, 1989A&amp;A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $\mu$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, Galactic Astronomy has largely concerned itself with astrophysical processes, and with the locations, space motions and compositions of objects. Consider, for example, the elucidation of the components of the Galaxy over the past decades, its mapping as enabled by Gaia and its predecessors, the photometric and spectroscopic characterization of innumerable astrophysical objects in various wavelength ranges, both from the ground and from space, and the expanding discovery and characterization of exoplanets; all focused on the current, static Galaxy. This White Paper proposes a dedicated program to derive stellar ages from time-series spectroscopy to hasten the transformation of this static conception into a dynamical one with age-labeled objects and events.</description>

      <title>Long Period Transients (LPTs): a comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.</description>

      <title>Circumplanetary Disk Candidate in the Disk of HD 163296 Traced by Localized Emission from Simple Organics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations suggest that the disc of HD 163296 is being actively shaped by embedded, yet unseen protoplanets, as indicated by numerous gas and dust substructures consistent with planet-disc interaction models. We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and C2H, tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the HD 163296 system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\pm7$ au and azimuth $\phi=46\pm3^\circ$ (or $R=0.75''$, $\rm{{PA}}=350^\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD--isolated with a 7$\sigma$ significance--we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $M_{\rm Jup}$, consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet's Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T &gt; 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\rm p} &lt; 1.0$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, and CPD radii $R_{\rm CPD} &lt; 2$ au.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the quiet-Sun center-to-limb variations (CLV) of the He I triplet at 10 830 {\AA} and the nearby Si I 10 827 {\AA} line, observed with GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+). The observations cover the interval $\mu = [0.1,\, 1.0]$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the heliocentric angle. At each $\mu$-position, the spectra are spatially averaged over 0.02 $\mu$, and the resulting CLVs are given both as these averaged data points and as smooth polynomial curves fitted across each wavelength point. The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451646.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an eclipsing, mass-transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with an 8.56-minute orbital period, identified via periodic variability in light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium-dominated accretion disk, while high-speed photometry with ULTRACAM shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade-long timing baseline using data from ATLAS, Gaia, ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope, and the proto-Lightspeed instrument on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline, we measure an orbital period derivative of dP/dt = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of the period derivative indicate that the orbital evolution is governed by the interplay between gravitational-wave-driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star's structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational wave emission, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain of the system for future space-based observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We predict a characteristic strain corresponding to a four-year signal-to-noise ratio greater than approximately 20, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective source for probing long-term orbital evolution in the mass-transferring regime.</description>

      <title>Multiple Populations and a CH Star Found in the 300S Globular Cluster Stellar Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) display chemical enrichment in a phenomenon called multiple stellar populations (MSPs). While the enrichment mechanism is not fully understood, there is a correlation between a cluster's mass and the fraction of enriched stars found therein. However, present-day GC masses are often smaller than their masses at the time of formation due to dynamical mass loss. In this work, we explore the relationship between mass and MSPs using the stellar stream 300S. We present the chemical abundances of eight red giant branch member stars in 300S with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/MIKE. We identify one enriched star characteristic of MSPs and no detectable metallicity dispersion, confirming that the progenitor of 300S was a globular cluster. The fraction of enriched stars (12.5\%) observed in our 300S stars is less than the 50\% of stars found enriched in Milky Way GCs of comparable present-day mass ($\sim10^{4.5}$\msun). We calculate the mass of 300S's progenitor and compare it to the initial masses of intact GCs, finding that 300S aligns well with the trend between the system mass at formation and enrichment. 300S's progenitor may straddle the critical mass threshold for the formation of MSPs and can therefore serve as a benchmark for the stellar enrichment process. Additionally, we identify a CH star, with high abundances of \textit{s}-process elements, probably accreted from a binary companion. The rarity of such binaries in intact GCs may imply stellar streams permit the survival of binaries that would otherwise be disrupted.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While most of the 6000 discovered exoplanets are highly unlike the Earth, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As detections increase, it is critical to test the empirical HZ as well as its limits using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to test the limits of surface habitability.
  We analysed data from Gaia DR3 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) of all known exoplanets, identifying future targets to test limits of habitability through i) orbits near the edges of the HZ, ii) similar irradiation environments to modern Earth, and iii) large eccentricities. We prioritize targets for transmission observations, light curve measurements, and direct imaging, identify the oldest HZ rocky worlds based on the NEA and complementary literature data, and provide theoretical limits for the empirical HZ and a 3D-HZ for each system.
  Our analysis shows 45 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 24 in a narrower 3D-HZ. For context, we compare their demographics to those of the full catalog of exoplanets in the NEA. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), and LIFE -- and design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these worlds, addressing the question of the limits of exoplanet surface habitability.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), using the XNS code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. We investigate equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries and incorporate complex many-body effects through microscopically derived proton pairing gaps. The models employ equations of state (EoS) obtained from microscopic many-body theory - including realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions - as well as from relativistic mean-field approaches. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent in one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LXXI. A sub-Neptune suitable for atmospheric characterization in a multiplanet and mutually inclined system orbiting the bright K dwarf TOI-5789 (HIP 99452)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11490</link>

Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. TOI-5789 is a mutually inclined system as the difference between the orbital inclinations of planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that these relatively high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</description>

      <title>Classical Cepheids in the Galactic thin disk I. Abundance gradients via non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (CCs) have long been considered excellent tracers of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's young disk. We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Red noise-based false alarm thresholds for astrophysical periodograms via Whittle's approximation to the likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomers who search for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle periodograms rely on false alarm level (FAL) estimates to identify statistically significant peaks. Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\alpha$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\alpha$~Cen~B $\log R^{\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction. Software for calculating red noise-based FALs is available on GitHub.</description>
