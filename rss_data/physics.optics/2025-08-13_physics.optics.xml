      <title>Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formally defines optogeometric factor as a pixel level measure of geometric optical throughput.
  The quantity is formally defined as the surface solid angle integral of the local etendue between a pixel and its corresponding scene element. Under ideal geometric optical conditions, it can be approximated by the product of the projected pixel footprint area on the object plane and the solid angle covered by the entrance pupil. Provides a compact link between the radiance of the scene and the radiant flux collected by a single pixel, making explicit the spatial angular coupling that governs the radiometric measurements at the pixel level.
  Two mathematically equivalent expressions of optogeometric factor are derived: a scene based form, expressed via the footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed via the pixel pitch and optical f number. Their equivalence is demonstrated analytically and confirmed using representative parameters of real thermal imaging systems.
  The concept is extended to effective optogeometric factor, which incorporates the pixel fill factor to account for the active area of the sensor. This concept enables a clear separation of geometric optical coupling from detector design and other calibration terms, offering a physically transparent and transferable basis for quantitative thermography and other imaging modalities operating in the geometric optics regime.</description>

      <title>The interplay between high-harmonic generation and photoluminescence in ZnO: Anisotropic spectral properties of harmonic emission and the role of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear optical response of bulk ZnO under intense short-wave infrared excitation, focusing on the interplay between high-harmonic generation (HHG) and photoluminescence (PL). While HHG exhibits non-perturbative intensity scaling and a spectral blueshift consistent with plasma-induced refractive index changes, the PL signal shows a pronounced superlinear increase and a redshift, attributed to a combination of exciton-exciton scattering and phonon-assisted exciton recombination emission. A similar PL response under above-bandgap excitation supports its intrinsic origin. Spectral analysis of the HHG emission reveals an intensity-driven transition in the characteristics of the fifth harmonic, indicating a change in the underlying generation mechanism. These findings establish PL and spectral HHG analysis as complementary probes of strong-field and many-body effects in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>High-definition 3D suspended Archimedean spiral with broadband, spatially extended, and single-handed optical chirality enhancement in Vis-NIR range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D plasmonic structures can provide giant optical chirality (C) in the near field, enabling strong interactions with enantiomers for chiral sensing applications. However, these structures face several limitations, including narrow operational bandwidth constrained by resonance, flipping handedness of C around the resonant frequency, spatially confined distribution of C, and difficulty in trapping enantiomers. Our numerical predictions reveal that a 3D plasmonic Archimedean spiral (AS) exhibits spectrally broadband, spatially extended and single-handed near-field C in visible-to-near-infrared range. However, realizing highly deterministic 3D AS remains challenging. We develop an effective fabrication strategy that combines focused ion beam milling and template-stripping method to realize high-definition 3D AS. Furthermore, we experimentally characterize the fabricated structure's far-field chiroptical behavior to confirm the predicted optical response. Owing to its conical hole-like geometry, 3D AS can potentially function as a sieve for trapping enantiomer-functionalized nanoparticles in the hot zone with enhanced C for sensitive broadband chirotical detection.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Switchable Polarization Lasing between q-BIC and Bragg Resonance Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) enable low-threshold lasing through high-Q cavity modes, yet their polarization tunability remains constrained by nanostructure-imposed cavity symmetries. By engineering a microcavity with an optimized duty cycle (0.34), we demonstrate a polarization-switchable distributed feedback (DFB) laser with controlled emission transitions between dual off-{\Gamma} q-BIC lasing and single {\Gamma}-point Bragg resonance (BR) lasing through switching pump polarization. The switching mechanism shows unprecedented robustness in varying waveguide thickness and photonic crystal period of DFB structures. Our findings extend the capabilities of DFB lasers beyond their conventional limits, opening opportunities for nanophotonics, classical and quantum optics applications.</description>

      <title>Zeolitic imidazolate framework glasses emit white light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) glasses represent a newly emerged class of melt-quenched glasses, characterized by their intrinsic nanoporous structure, good processability, and multifunctionalities such as gas separation and energy storage. However, creating photonic functionalities in Zn-based ZIF glasses remains elusive. Here we show a remarkable broadband white light-emitting behavior in a Zn-based ZIF glass, which can be enhanced by annealing. Furthermore, we discovered a sharp red shift upon increasing annealing temperature above the critical temperature of 1.07Tg, where Tg is the glass transition temperature, for a short duration of 30 min. Finally, we achieved a high absolute internal photoluminescence quantum yield of 12.2% upon annealing of ZIF glass at 1.13Tg. Based on the optimally annealed ZIF glass, we fabricated a white light-emitting diode (LED) with the luminous efficacy of 4.2 lm/W and high operational stability, retaining 74.1% of its initial luminous efficacy after 180 min of continuous operation. These results not only demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing ZIF glasses in LED applications but also mark a significant advancement in the development of durable, efficient, and multifunctional photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Vortex Light at the Nanoscale: Twists, Spins, and Surprises -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over three decades, the study of optical vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been at the forefront of optics, driven by fundamental questions about optical momentum as well as diverse applications in quantum information, communications, and optical manipulation. Most work has focused on paraxial beams, whose transverse fields are accurately described by conventional wave optics and the Stokes formalism. By contrast, when light is confined to the nanoscale and tightly focused beyond the paraxial regime, vortex beams exhibit complex electromagnetic structures that transcend these conventional models. In this deeply non-paraxial regime, the resulting fields display rich and often counterintuitive behaviour, opening new perspectives on light-matter interactions. This review unifies the emerging physics of nanoscale optical vortices by developing a coherent theoretical framework and offering a critical synthesis of recent advances, guiding readers toward a deeper understanding and stimulating future work in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Skyrmions with customized intensity distribution and trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions, which are topological protection quasi-particles with nontrivial textures, hold a pivotal focus in current structured light research for their potential in diverse applications. In this work, the angular spectrum theory is first introduced into the generation of optical skyrmions and modulation of the intensity and trajectory of skyrmions at will. We propose a novel theoretical approach for the generation of skyrmions, including Neel-type, Bloch-type, anti-type and 2nd order. The simultaneous and independent modulation of intensity distribution and trajectory of isolated skyrmions is first achieved with the combination of phase-shifting theory with angular spectrum theory. By controlling the displacement phase factor (DPF), the customized shape of skyrmions array with controllable intensity distribution and trajectory is also generated. Our findings in this work allow a greater exploration of skyrmions, which promote applications in particle manipulation and high-density storage.</description>

      <title>Metric-Induced Principal Symbols in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometrical formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics by expressing its principal symbol as an optical metric-induced object. Under the assumption of no birefringence, we show that the evolution of linear perturbations can be recast as a covariant divergence on a curved, field-dependent background, enabling the application of quantum field theory techniques as in Maxwell's theory in curved backgrounds. This geometric reformulation opens a new route for analogue models potentially implementable in laboratory via tailored nonlinear metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Structure-Adaptive Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic Band Gaps with TE-Polarized Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging our structure-adaptive topology optimization framework based on the integration of the photonic density of states over a frequency window for the TM polarization of light [see A. Bahulikar et al., arXiv:2411.09165 (2025)], we show that the $\Gamma$-point and full Brillouin zone integration schemes can also recover two-dimensional photonic crystals for TE polarization. For the $\Gamma$-point formalism, we employ the scalar magnetic field formulation of the electromagnetic wave equation with independent sources polarized in the x and y directions. For the full Brillouin zone formalism, we employ the vector electric field formulation of the electromagnetic wave equation, again with independent sources polarized in the x and y directions. This work can simultaneously treat frequency-dependent optical response, allow for targeted optimization for a given frequency and reciprocal lattice vector pair, and inherently encourage binarized designs.</description>

      <title>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz-like Metastability and Optimal Dephasing in Dissipative Bosonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing: while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.</description>

      <title>Relative Wavefront Errors in Continuous-Variable Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When undertaking continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) across atmospheric channels, strong classical local oscillators (LOs) are often polarization-multiplexed with the weak quantum signals for coherent measurement at the receiver. Although the wavefronts of the quantum signal and LO are often assumed to experience the same distortion across channels, previous theoretical work has shown that they can experience differential distortions, resulting in relative wavefront errors (WFEs). Such errors have previously been shown to limit CV-QKD performance, in some cases leading to zero secure key rates. In this work, for the first time, we provide strong experimental evidence that relative WFEs are present in some circumstances and that standard assumptions in CV-QKD deployments may need to be revisited. In addition, we demonstrate how turbulence can affect the detailed form of the relative WFEs, thereby indicating that long-range links like terrestrial-satellite channels are likely impacted more than short-range terrestrial-only channels.</description>

      <title>Temperature-compensating package for OH line filters for astronomy: II. manufacture, assembly, and performance study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line filters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR) astronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new self-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in non-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long single-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A fourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the uncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal cycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift of only 0.37 pm/$^{\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\circ}$C to 15$^{\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum wavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference filter grating was $\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of the prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs, particularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer stability.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear periodic orbit solutions and their bifurcation structure at the origin of soliton hopping in coupled microresonators</title>

Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs, essential for future integrated optical systems, rely on dissipative Kerr solitons generated in a single microresonator to achieve coherent frequency comb generation. Recent advances in the nanofabrication of low-loss integrated nonlinear microresonators have paved the way for the exploration of coupled-resonator systems. These systems provide significant technological advantages, including higher conversion efficiency and the generation of dual dispersive waves. Beyond their practical benefits, coupled-resonator systems also reveal novel emergent nonlinear phenomena, such as soliton hopping, a dynamic process in which solitons periodically transfer between coupled resonators. In this study, we employ a dynamical system approach and the corresponding well-established numerical techniques, extensively developed within the context of hydrodynamics and transitional turbulence, to investigate the bifurcation structure of periodic orbit solutions of the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations that underlie soliton hopping in photonic dimers and trimers. Our main finding uncovers a fundamental difference in the origin of the hopping process in dimers and trimers. We demonstrate that in dimers, hopping emerges from a branch of stable soliton solutions, whereas in trimers, it originates from an unstable branch. This distinction leads to a significant difference in pump power requirements. We relate the bifurcation structure of the periodic orbits including their stability to the observed dynamics in simulated laser scans mimicking typical experimental investigations. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations of unstable equilibrium branches specifically explain observed hysteresis, the coexistence of multiple attractors at the same parameter values, and the importance of choosing a specific path in parameter space to reliably achieve a desired dynamical regime.</description>

Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a design rule check correction algorithm to more readily meet fabrication constraints, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. A statistical study is performed on a 2D modal multiplexer, revealing that 87% of devices optimized using this strategy conform to foundry constraints, compared to 13% of devices optimized using traditional TO. We apply seeded topology optimization to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. Using this optimization strategy, the measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from &lt; 1.50 dB to &lt; 0.64 dB, and the measured TE1 insertion loss of the TE modal multiplexer was reduced from &lt; 3.95 dB to &lt; 1.38 dB over C-band. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation of quantum emitters as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) cavities offer a scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). Unlike traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach uses lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, CMOS-compatible modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance regime with linear, high sensitivity to small perturbations. Using silicon PICs as an example, we show detection limits down to 10^{-9} RIU for Q = 10^5-10^7 cavities, matching or exceeding plasmonic and microresonator sensors with simpler instrumentation. Long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon allow sub-nanosecond shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of silicon-based quantum emitters remains unproven, the concept is generic and applicable to other PIC platforms, including diamond-, silicon nitride-, and silicon carbide-based systems where such operation is established.</description>

      <title>Zitterbewegung, momentum and spin dynamics of electromagnetic wave in linear dielectric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index $n$, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of $n$ according to Max Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Hermann Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineered Layer Dependent Nonlinear Optical Response in Two Dimensional Muscovite for Efficient Optical Limiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant interest due to their distinctive optical and electronic properties. Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement mediated by DC current induced nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons. Nonreciprocal systems are ideal for the enhancement, control, and preservation of entanglement due to the potential for unidirectional beam-like wave propagation, i.e., efficiently transporting photons from one emitter to another. Using a quantum master equation and three-dimensional Green's function analysis, we investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters dominantly interacting via electric current induced nonreciprocal plasmonic modes of a graphene waveguide. We use concurrence as a measure of entanglement. We show that nonreciprocal graphene plasmon polaritons are a promising candidate to generate and mediate concurrence, where it is shown that there is good enhancement and control of entanglement over vacuum, which is beneficial for the broad applications of entanglement as a quantum resource. We believe our findings contribute to the development of quantum devices, enabling efficient and tunable entanglement between two-level systems, which is a central goal in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning the terahertz response of liquids by creating polar many-body excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A surprising result from the theory of quantum control is the degree to which the properties of a physical system can be manipulated. Both atomic and many-body solid state models admit the possibility of creating a 'driven imposter', in which the optical response of one material mimics that of a dynamically distinct system. Here we apply these techniques to polarons in polar liquids. Such quasiparticles describe solvated electrons interacting with many-body degrees of freedom of their environment. The polaron frequency, which depends on the electron concentration in the liquid, is controlled with a pump field, rendering the polaron frequency of three different liquids identical. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of 'polar impostorons', a so far purely theoretical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of Phonon Chirality under Symmetry Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations, and their modes (linear, circular, or stationary) are symmetry-determined. Circularly polarized phonons, possessing nonzero angular momentum (AM), have drawn widespread attention recently. Despite widespread use of pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) and circularly polarized light polarization flips to identify chiral phonons in Raman scattering, their reliability is debated due to symmetry dependence, and experimental verification standards remain lacking. Here, we systematically study phonon chirality and associated phenomena across magnetic point groups. We establish that the AM-PAM correlation is governed by both crystalline symmetry and Wyckoff positions, dictating conditions where nonzero AM manifests in PAM signatures. Crucially, phonons belonging to distinct irreducible representations exhibit distinct experimental benchmarks, enabling direct determination of crystalline chirality and symmetry classification. Furthermore, we report the discovery of a signature for symmetry-induced phenomena, notably a half-wave plate-analogous effect induced by mirror-odd phonons. Meanwhile, we conducted five experiments to validate our theory.</description>

      <title>Fiber transmission of cluster states via multi-level time-bin encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process, rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers, permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.</description>

      <title>Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>
