      <title>Constraining star formation in M87 using deep HST UV data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F275W ultraviolet (UV) imaging of M87 to obtain the most robust constraints on its star formation rate (SFR) and star formation history (SFH). After removing the galaxy continuum and globular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center. By comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by stochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we ruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We found an extremely low SFR of $\sim 2\times10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87, with evidence of a weak starburst $\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\sim 1000$ M$_\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and directly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and H$\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history suggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither triggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier outbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments co-spatial with H$\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though they are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered by metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing low-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that AGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even though some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot created by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained.</description>

      <title>Studying the gaseous outskirts of galaxy groups with coherent Ly alpha absorption patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the properties of diffuse intergalactic gas residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052, NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz&lt;2000 km/s) beyond their group virial radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent. We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit redshift of dN/dz=232pm58.This is 25 percent above the value derived for the general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups. Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the robustness of the Auriga galaxy formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing galactic feedback history via the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on the low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest as a potential constraint on galactic feedback, as different AGN and stellar feedback models in hydrodynamic simulations produce varying intergalactic medium (IGM) statistics. However, existing low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data provide insufficient observational constraints for simulations due to their low precision and the lack of observations from $z \sim 0.4$ to $1.8$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory, equipped with an ultraviolet (FUV / NUV) spectrograph, could provide transformative data for this science by increasing both absorbers in the redshift range where current data are lacking and increasing the precision of the Ly$\alpha$ forest observational data at $z \leq 0.4$. This spectrograph should cover the wavelengths $1215-3402$ \AA~and have a spectral resolution of $R =$~40,000. Distinguishing between certain active-galactic nuclei feedback models requires high precision ($\sim 5-10$\%) measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum for $z\leq 1.8$. This requires $\sim 830$ QSO spectra with S/N~$\geq5$ - $25$ depending on redshift. This data would also enable a comprehensive study on the thermal state of the IGM across time, and address the tension between the observed and simulated Ly$\alpha$ forest $b$-value distribution.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: New JWST Constraints on Satellite Models and Subhalo Tidal Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has revolutionized the study of faint satellite galaxies at $z \gtrsim 1$, enabling statistical constraints on galaxy evolution and the galaxy$-$halo connection in a previously unexplored mass and redshift regime. We compare satellite abundances at $1 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from recent JWST observations with predictions from cosmological dark matter-only zoom-in simulations. We identify and quantify several sources of biases that can impact theoretical satellite counts, finding that assumptions about subhalo tidal evolution introduce the largest uncertainty in predictions for the satellite mass function. Using a flexible galaxy disruption model, we explore a range of disruption scenarios, spanning hydrodynamically motivated and idealized prescriptions, to bracket plausible physical outcomes. We show that varying galaxy durability can change the predicted satellite mass functions by a factor of $\sim3.5$. The JWST data and our fiducial model are consistent within $1-2\sigma$ across the full redshift ($1 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$) and stellar mass ($M_\star&gt; 10^7~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) range probed. We find evidence that subhalos are at least as long-lived as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. Our framework will enable robust constraints on the tidal evolution of subhalos with future observations. This work presents the first direct comparison between cosmological models and observations of the high-redshift satellite population in this low-mass regime. These results showcase JWST's emerging power to test structure formation in the first half of the Universe in a new domain and to constrain the physical processes driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Nature of High Equivalent Width Emitters in the Epoch of Reionization Revealed by JWST Medium-band Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at high redshifts are considered key contributors to cosmic reionization at $z&gt;6$ due to their higher ionization efficiencies. We have identified 119 H$\beta$ + [OIII] emitters at $z\sim7$ selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 $&lt;$ EW$_{0}$/\r{A} $&lt;$ 6850 (with the median value of $\sim1700$ \r{A}). Among them, 19 are EW$_{0}$ $&gt;$ 3000 \r{A}, which represent extreme populations even in the context of recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass ($\sim 3\times10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), (ii) blue colors ($\beta_{\rm UV}\sim -2.2$), and (iii) low dust attenuation ($A_{\mathrm{V}}\sim 0.1$ mag). We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13 emitters with spatially offset H$\beta$ + [OIII] emission compared to the UV and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Unveiling M33's Hidden Merger History: A Potential Population of Star Clusters on Retrograde Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a possible sub-population of stellar clusters that appear to follow retrograde orbits around the third largest galaxy in the Local Group, M33 (Triangulum). This spiral disk galaxy has apparently had a mostly quiescent existence, although recent discoveries, particularly of a pronounced warp in the gas and stellar disk, suggest that M33's relatively quiet past was interrupted at least once by a dynamical interaction with another galaxy. We suggest that this sub population provides evidence of accretion of one or more dwarf galaxies in M33's history. We estimate a lower limit for the accreted halo virial mass of $M_{\rm vir} \sim (7 \pm 3) \times 10^{10}$\msun, accounting for about 10\% of the virial mass in the halo of M33 that has an accretion origin. We propose one of these accretion events as the source of the observed warp in M33's disk.</description>

      <title>The $z=7.08$ quasar ULAS J1120+0641 May Never Reach a "Normal" Black Hole to Stellar Mass Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.</description>

      <title>ALMA FACTS III. High-Resolution CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) Maps of Twelve Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present early results from a high-resolution analysis ($\sim$100-200pc) of the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio in twelve nearby galaxies. We use new ALMA CO(1-0) observations from the Fundamental CO(1-0) Transition Survey (FACTS), and re-imaged CO(2-1) data from PHANGS. We make empirical classifications based on the optical and molecular gas morphologies, which show clear systematic trends in the variation of $R_{21}$ as a function of galactic structure. The sample includes barred and unbarred, and flocculent galaxies. The barred spiral galaxies follow a general trend: $R_{21}$ is high in the center, low along the bar, increases at the bar ends, and then declines in the outer parts of the disk. The structure dependence suggests the importance of galactic dynamics on molecular gas evolution, and consequently on star formation, in galaxies. $R_{21}$ fluctuates in the spiral arms for both barred and unbarred galaxies. HII regions increase $R_{21}$ locally in their surrounding gas and are often associated with galactic structures. Together, $R_{21}$ varies systematically as a function of galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.</description>

      <title>An integral field spectroscopic study of stellar and ionized gas properties around edge-on disk galaxies in the stellar mass range 9&lt;log M*&lt;11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stellar light, 4000 Angstrom break and emission line profiles of 82 edge-on disk galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We characterize the stellar light profiles perpendicular to the disk plane using two parameters: a) the power law slope of the thick disk component, 2) the transition radius where the profile flattens. The 4000 Angstrom break profiles perpendicular to the plane are characterized by the number of significant changes in slope (breaks) and by the change in D_n(4000) from inner to outer disk. The slope correlates tightly with the stellar mass of the galaxy over the stellar mass range 10^9&lt;log M*&lt;10^10 M_sun. More massive galaxies have more extended thick disks. The slope and transition radius exhibit large scatter for galaxies more massive than 10^{10} M_sun. Half the sample have older stellar populations in their thick disks, a third have flat D$_n$(4000) profiles and 15% have younger thick disks. The D$_n$(4000) profiles exhibit as many as 4 separate breaks. There are more breaks in massive galaxies with bulges and more extended thick disks. This may indicate that the breaks are produced by more frequent accretion events in such systems. The extra-planar Halpha EQW correlates most strongly with the specific star formation rate of the galaxy, and the [OII]/Halpha ratio increases with distance from the disk plane. This increase is most apparent for massive galaxies with extended thick disk components and low SFR/M* These findings support the hypothesis that the larger [OII]/Halpha ratios may be caused by ionization from evolved stars.</description>

Abstract: Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($&gt;10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and sizes (&gt;30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass $M_{200}\simeq 5\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass $&gt;10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing by black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing in the strong-field regime for a black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity with Rainbow gravity modifications. This black hole spacetime is characterized by the Euler Heisenberg parameter, F(R) parameters, Rainbow functions, the black hole charge Q, and mass M . We numerically compute the strong deflection angle and its associated coefficients, and explore their astrophysical implications for supermassive black holes in different galaxies. Our findings show that increasing the Euler Heisenberg parameter enhances key lensing observables such as the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, angular position, relative magnification, Einstein ring radius, and time delay for a fixed Q . Conversely, increasing Q decreases these parameters while keeping other quantities fixed. Additionally, a higher Euler Heisenberg parameter reduces the deflection angle and angular separation S , whereas increasing Q causes both to increase. Our study reveals that black holes in this modified gravity framework can act as strong gravitational lenses, producing deflection angles that surpass those of Reissner Nordstrom and Schwarzschild black holes under specific conditions. These results highlight the unique topological features of modified charged black holes and suggest their potential as astrophysical candidates, offering new insights into their observational signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the lensing predictions with respect to changes in the functional forms of the Rainbow functions. The combined effects of F(R) gravity, Euler Heisenberg electrodynamics, and Rainbow gravity introduce novel qualitative features not present in the individual models.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using K-means and Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying stars, galaxies, and quasars is essential for understanding cosmic structure and evolution, but the vast data from modern surveys make manual classification impractical, while supervised learning methods remain constrained by the scarcity of labeled spectroscopic data. We aim to develop a scalable, label-efficient method for astronomical classification by leveraging semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome the limitations of fully supervised approaches. We propose a novel SSL framework combining K-means clustering with Random Forest classification. Our method partitions unlabeled data into 50 clusters, propagates labels from spectroscopically confirmed centroids to 95\% of cluster members, and trains a Random Forest on the expanded pseudo-labeled dataset. We apply this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey photometric and spectroscopic data, and compare performance with a fully supervised Random Forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1-scores of 98.8\%, 98.9\%, and 92.0\% for stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the supervised method with F1-scores of 99.1\%, 99.1\%, and 93.1\% while outperforming traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates robustness in high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency compared to prior work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for astronomical classification when labeled data is limited, though performance may degrade in lower-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>ChemZz I: Comparing Oxygen and Iron Abundance Patterns in the Milky Way, the Local Group and Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies has advanced through measurements from both distant galaxies across redshift, and our own Milky Way (MW). To form a comprehensive picture, it is essential to unify these constraints, placing them on a common scale and parlance and to understand their systematic differences. In this study, we homogenize oxygen and iron measurements from star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z{\sim}2-3$) with resolved stellar abundances from the Local Group. The MW is divided into four components, assuming the outer halo is dominated by debris from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor. After converting all abundances to a common Solar scale, we identify clear $\alpha$- and iron-enhancement trends with mass in the $z{\sim}2-3$ galaxies and find good agreement between these galaxies and the MW high-$\alpha$ disc in [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]. We also find excellent agreement between the [O/Fe] trends seen in the MW high- and low-$\alpha$ discs with O-abundances seen in old and young planetary nebulae in M~31 respectively, supporting the existence of $\alpha$-bimodality in the inner regions of M~31. Finally, we use globular cluster ages to project the MW and GSE back in time to $z{\sim}3$ and find that their estimated mass, oxygen and iron abundances are strikingly consistent with the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}3$. In the future, increased transparency around the choice of Solar scale and abundance methodology will make combining chemical abundances easier -- contributing to a complete picture of the chemical evolution of all galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We report on the observation and measurement of astrometry, photometry, morphology, and activity of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), with the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The third interstellar object, comet 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered on UT 2025 July 1. Serendipitously, the Rubin Observatory collected imaging in the area of the sky inhabited by the object during regular commissioning activities. We successfully recovered object detections from Rubin visits spanning UT 2025 June 21 (10 days before discovery) to UT 2025 July 7. Facilitated by Rubin's high resolution and large aperture, we report on the detection of cometary activity as early as June 21st, and observe it throughout. We measure the location and magnitude of the object on 37 Rubin images in r, i, and z bands, with typical precision of about 20 mas (100 mas, systematic) and about 10 mmag, respectively. We use these to derive improved orbit solutions, and to show there is no detectable photometric variability on hourly timescales. We derive a V-band absolute magnitude of H_V = (13.7 +/- 0.2) mag, and an equivalent effective nucleus radius of around (5.6 +/- 0.7) km. These data represent the earliest observations of this object by a large (8-meter class) telescope reported to date, and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries) Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide once operational later this year.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>reLAISS: A Python Package for Flexible Similarity Searches of Supernovae and Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery rates of supernovae are expected to surpass one million events annually with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. With unprecedented sample sizes of both common and rare transient types, photometric classification alone will be insufficient for finding one-in-a-million events and prioritizing the 1% of events for spectroscopic follow-up observations. Here, we present reLAISS, a modified framework for similarity searches of supernovae using extracted features of ZTF light curves and Pan-STARRS host galaxy photometry and built on the original LAISS framework. Unlike its predecessor, reLAISS couples interpretable light curve morphology features with extinction-corrected host-galaxy colors to probe both explosion physics and associated stellar populations simultaneously. The library allows users to customize the number of neighbors retrieved, the weight of host and light curve features, and the use of Monte Carlo simulations to ensure relevant matches when features are poorly constrained. We release reLAISS as a pip-installable package with an accompanying reference set of 20,000 features, and a set of tutorials that demonstrate the code's expanded functionality. All source code can be found at https://github.com/evan-reynolds/re-laiss .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new time-series CCD \emph{VR} photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5634. We aim to use the known RR Lyrae stars, members of the cluster, as indicators of mean metallicity and distance. Accurate coordinates, periods and an identification chart of the variables in the field of our images are provided. A membership analysis was performed, based on $Gaia$-DR3 proper motions, for 3525 point sources within 15 arcmin from the cluster center. The membership status for each known variable was established and it was found that V10, V11 and V16 are most likely field stars. The variability of the RRab star V7, considered non-variable for a number of years, is demonstrated. Via the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of cluster member RR Lyrae, the mean metallicity and distance were calculated independently from RRab and RRc stars to find [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.67 \pm 0.11$ y $D=23.9 \pm 0.8$ kpc, and [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.69 \pm 0.22$ y $D=22.9 \pm 1.0$ kpc respectively.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- VI. The Lowest-Mass Objects in M 4 and the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present `James Webb Space Telescope' observations of M4 -- the closest globular cluster -- that probe the lower Main Sequence down to the hydrogen-burning limit. The unveiled stellar sequence reaches much fainter luminosities than previously possible, revealing a few extremely red objects that are consistent with brown dwarfs as cool as T_eff~1000K. However, the lack of a second JWST epoch presently prevents us from verifying the cluster membership of these objects. By cross-matching our data with archival `Hubble Space Telescope' images, we are able to verify cluster membership for a subset of objects down to T_eff~3000K. The observed color distribution indicate that the lower Main Sequence of M4 is likely deficient in oxygen compared to its higher-mass post-Main Sequence members by ~0.5dex. This feature has now been observed in three different globular clusters (M4, NGC6397 and 47Tuc), suggesting a general trend. Finally, we derive the mass function of the Galactic bulge in the background of M4. The mass function was found to have the bottom-heavy slope of alpha=0.88+/-0.36 and appears to terminate at ~0.15 M_Sun, although the latter value may be overestimated due to the limited sample size.</description>

      <title>The Double-Episode Jet Genesis of the eROSITA and Fermi Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles are two pairs of large diffuse multi-band structures detected in our Milky Way galaxy, yet their origins remain uncertain. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the model where these bubbles were produced by two successive active galactic nucleus jet activities from the Galactic center, with their edges delineated by the correspondingly driven forward shocks. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed morphology, multi-band X-ray surface brightness distributions between 0.11 and 2.04 keV, and O viii/O vii line ratios, matching ROSAT and eROSITA observations. The results indicate that the first jet pair, launched 15 Myr ago, created the eROSITA bubbles, now extending to ~15 kpc with gas temperatures of ~0.25 keV. The second jet pair, launched 5 Myr ago, produced the Fermi bubbles, currently reaching ~10 kpc with temperatures of 0.3--0.4 keV. The sharp edges of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles are naturally explained by the forward shocks in this double-episode jet scenario. Our findings support a Galactic-scale origin for these structures and suggest episodic jet activities from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>NGC 663 as a laboratory for massive star evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive young clusters with rich populations of high-mass stars are ideal laboratories to explore their evolutionary paths. Despite being the most prominent cluster in the Perseus-arm Cas OB8 association, NGC 663 remains comparatively little studied. We present a comprehensive investigation of its properties, integrating astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for the cluster and its surroundings, including accurate spectral classification for over 150 members. Gaia astrometry indicates over 300 B-type members, possibly rendering NGC 663 the most massive cluster in the Perseus arm, with initial mass likely exceeding 10000 M_\sun . This large population makes NGC 663 an excellent laboratory for studying massive star evolution. Spectral analysis of the earliest members reveals approximately solar metallicity and a turn-off mass of approximate 8.5 M_\sun, consistent with the photometric age of 23 Ma. We identify five spectroscopic blue stragglers, including the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9$+$6121. We outline its evolutionary history and compare its properties with other Be stars. Although the cluster contains many Be stars, their relative fraction is not particularly high. Intriguingly, four of the six blue supergiant members appear to have significantly higher masses than the brightest giants near the Hertzsprung gap. These observations suggest that most mid-B supergiants may form via mergers, unless stars of 10-12 M_\sun born as primaries in binaries rarely undergo supernova explosions. Similarly, if Be stars form through the binary channel, then either most are produced through case A evolution or supernovae are uncommon among primaries in this mass range.</description>

      <title>The formation of supermassive black holes from Population III.1 seeds. III. Galaxy evolution and black hole growth from semi-analytic modelling</title>

Abstract: We present an implementation of Pop III.1 seeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution to assess the growth the SMBH population and the properties of the host galaxies. The model of Pop III.1 seeding involves SMBH formation at redshifts $z\gtrsim 20$ in dark matter minihalos that are isolated from external radiative feedback, parameterized by isolation distance $d_{\rm iso}$. Within a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we generate dark matter halos using the code PINOCCHIO and seed them according to the Pop III.1 scenario, exploring values of $d_{\rm iso}$ from 50 to 100~kpc (proper distance). We consider two alternative cases of SMBH seeding: a Halo Mass Threshold (HMT) model in which all halos $&gt;7\times10^{10}\:M_\odot$ are seeded with $\sim 10^5\:M_\odot$ black holes; an All Light Seed (ALS) model in which all halos are seeded with low, stellar-mass black holes. We follow the redshift evolution of the halos, populating them with galaxies using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly theoretical model of galaxy formation, including accretion on SMBHs and related feedback processes. Here we present predictions for the properties of galaxy populations, focusing on stellar masses, star formation rates, and black hole masses. The local, $z\sim0$ metrics of occupation fraction as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), and black hole mass function (BHMF) all suggest a constraint of $d_{\rm iso}&lt;75\:$kpc. We discuss the implications of this result for the Pop III.1 seeding mechanism.</description>

      <title>Possible environmental quenching in an interacting little red dot pair at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a $z\sim7$ group of galaxies that contains two little red dots (LRDs) just 3.3 kpc apart, along with three potential satellite galaxies, as part of the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this LRD pair show evidence of a Balmer break, consistent with a recent ($\sim 100$ Myr) quenching of star formation. In contrast, the satellites are compatible with a recent-onset ($\sim 100$ Myr), ongoing burst of star formation. LRD1's SED is consistent with a dust-free active galactic nucleus (AGN) being the source of the UV excess in the galaxy. The optical continuum would be powered by the emission from an obscured post-starburst and the AGN at a subdominant level. LRD2's SED is more ambiguous, but it could also be indicative of a dust-free AGN. In this scenario, these LRDs would be massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10}\,M_\odot$) and dusty (A(V) $&gt;1$ mag) and the three satellites would be lower-mass objects ($M_\star\sim10^{8-9}\,M_\odot$) subject to low dust attenuations. The proximity of the two LRDs suggests that their interaction is responsible for their recent star formation histories, which can be interpreted as environmental bursting and quenching in the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Dust Distribution in Ionizing-photon Escape: NIRCam and MIRI Imaging of a Lyman Continuum-emitting Galaxy at z ~ 3.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of Ion1, a previously confirmed Lyman Continuum (LyC)-emitting galaxy at $z_{spec}=3.794$. Together with existing HST imaging, these new observations from the JADES program enable a joint analysis of Ion1's LyC, rest-frame UV, stellar, and dust emission with unprecedented detail. We report the first detection of dust emission at rest-frame $\sim3 \mu$m in a high-redshift LyC-emitting galaxy using MIRI/F1500W. Our analysis suggests a porous distribution of dust in Ion1, with regions exhibiting evidence of dust deficit coinciding both with LyC-emitting regions and with the peak of H$\alpha$ emission. Furthermore, multi-band NIRCam imaging reveals a strong FUV-to-optical color gradient, where LyC-emitting regions appear significantly bluer than the rest of Ion1. Spatially resolved SED fitting confirms that this color gradient is primarily driven by spatially varying dust attenuation. Together, these findings suggest that Ion1's LyC emission originates from a compact star-forming complex near its stellar-light centroid, where stellar feedback carves out low HI column density channels, facilitating LyC escape. However, only a fraction of these LyC photons - specifically those along sightlines with minimal HI obscuration - ultimately escape and reach observers. This work underscores the critical role of dust and neutral gas geometry in shaping LyC escape in galaxies at high redshifts. Anisotropic LyC escape may be a common feature in the early Universe, which must be properly incorporated to constrain the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>Redshift ~2.7 is not special</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galikyan et al. (2025) reported a statistically significant change in galaxy spectral properties at redshift $z$ $\simeq$ 2.7 based on a Kolmogorov Stochasticity Parameter analysis of JWST spectroscopic data of galaxies. In this comment, we demonstrate that their result is critically driven by a single outlier in the dataset. This outlier arises from the use of a questionable redshift estimate for one spectrum. When the outlier is removed or the redshift is corrected, the claimed transition at $z$ $\simeq$ 2.7 disappears entirely. By independently reproducing their analysis, we demonstrate that the claimed feature is not a robust statistical signal, but an artefact of this anomalous data point.</description>

      <title>An outer-disk SX Phe variable star in Rubin Data Preview 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields and cosmic rays in M31. II. Strength and distribution of the magnetic field components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensities of total, linearly polarized, and unpolarized synchrotron emission are measures for the strengths of total, ordered, and isotropic turbulent fields in the sky plane. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) provide a model of the regular field. The quadratic difference between ordered and regular field strengths yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field. - Based on observations of M31 at 3.6 cm, 6.2 cm, and 20.5 cm wavelengths and assuming equipartition between the energy densities of total magnetic fields and total cosmic rays, we measured average equipartition strengths of the magnetic field in the emission torus of M31 of 6.3\pm\0.2 \muG for the total, 5.4\pm0.2 \muG for the isotropic turbulent, and 3.2\pm0.3 \muG for the ordered field in the sky plane. The average strength of the axisymmetric regular field, Breg, is 2.0\pm0.5 \muG and remains almost constant between 7 kpc and 12 kpc radius. Quadratic subtraction of the component Breg,perp in the sky plane from the ordered field Bord,perp yields the strength of the anisotropic turbulent field Ban,perp, which is 2.7\pm0.7 \muG. - The average strength of the regular field is about 40% smaller than the equipartition strength of the ordered field, which is consistent with the assumption of equipartition. The almost constant ratio between regular and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.39 is consistent with present-day dynamo models. The almost constant ratio between anisotropic and isotropic turbulent fields of about 0.57 indicates that anisotropic turbulent fields are generated by the shearing of isotropic turbulent fields. - The average magnetic energy density is about five times larger than the thermal energy density of the diffuse warm ionized gas, while the magnetic energy density is similar to the kinetic energy density of turbulent motions of the neutral gas.</description>

      <title>McFACTS I: Testing the LVK AGN channel with Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing &amp; Simulation (McFACTS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a promising source of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in gravitational waves with LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK). Constraining the AGN channel allows us to limit AGN parameter space (disk density, size, average lifetime) and nuclear star cluster (NSC) parameter space. Constraints on AGN and NSCs have implications for $\Lambda$CDM models of AGN feedback and models of AGN-driven SMBH merger and growth. Here we present several qualitative studies of the AGN channel using new public, open-source, fast, reproducible code \texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{https://github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}:Monte Carlo for AGN channel Testing \&amp; Simulation. We demonstrate several important features for testing the AGN channel, including: i) growth to large mass IMBH is helped by the presence of migration traps or swamps, ii) flat BH initial mass functions highlight hierarchical merger features in the mass spectrum, iii) the ($q,\chi_{\rm eff}$) anti-correlation is a strong test of the bias to prograde mergers in the AGN channel, iv) spheroid encounters can drive a fraction of mergers with high in-plane spin components ($\chi_{\rm p}$), v) a high rate of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are driven by an initial population of embedded retrograde BH, vi) Both LVK and LISA are powerful probes of models of AGN disks and their embedded populations.</description>
