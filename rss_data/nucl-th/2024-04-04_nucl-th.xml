      <title>Ab initio leading order effective potential for elastic proton scattering based on the symmetry-adapted no-core shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Watson expansion of the multiple scattering series, we employ a nonlocal translationally invariant nuclear density derived within the symmetry-adapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) framework from a chiral next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) nucleon-nucleon interaction and the very same interaction for a consistent full-folding calculation of the effective (optical) potential for nucleon-nucleus scattering for medium-heavy nuclei. The leading order effective (optical) folding potential is computed by integrating over a translationally invariant SA-NCSM one-body scalar density, spin-projected momentum distribution, and the Wolfenstein amplitudes $A$, $C$, and $M$. The resulting nonlocal potentials serve as input for a momentum space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, whose solutions are summed up to obtain nucleon-nucleus scattering observables. In the SA-NCSM, the model space is systematically up-selected using $\SpR{3}$ symmetry considerations. For the light nucleus of $^6$He, we establish a systematic selection scheme in the SA-NCSM for scattering observables. Then, we apply this scheme to calculations of scattering observables, such as differential cross sections, analyzing powers, and spin rotation functions for elastic proton scattering from $^{20}$Ne and $^{40}$Ca in the energy regime between 65 and 200 MeV, and compare to available data. Our calculations show that the leading order effective nucleon-nucleus potential in the Watson expansion of multiple scattering theory obtained from an up-selected SA-NCSM model space describes $^{40}$Ca elastic scattering observables reasonably well to about 60 degrees in the center-of-mass frame, which coincides roughly with the validity of the NNLO chiral interaction used to calculate both the nucleon-nucleon amplitudes and the one-body scalar and spin nuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mean free path in neutron stars in the presence of hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>Information entropy for central $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions in the UrQMD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicity information entropy in central $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at impact parameters of 0$-$3 fm are calculated at various center of mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$) of 5.0, 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27.0, 32.0, 35.0, 39.0, and 54.4 GeV using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (UrQMD). The simulations in UrQMD model are compared with hydro modes with three different equations of state (EoS) and also with a default mode without hydrodynamics. The study reveals that the information entropies of baryons, net-baryons and net-protons with different equations of state in the hydro modes exhibit first decreases and then slowly increases with the increase of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, while those of hadrons and anti-hadrons, antibaryons show a monotonous increase with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$. An enhancement is found around $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ $\sim$ 30 GeV potentially corresponding to the critical endpoint with chiral hadron gas EoS and Bag model EoS.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the spin asymmetry in elastic polarized electron - nucleus collisions at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the numerical precision, dispersion corrections to the beam-normal spin asymmetry which arise from the dominant nuclear excitations, are estimated up to a collision energy of 1 GeV. A nonperturbative calculation of vacuum polarization and the vertex plus self-energy correction, using optimized potentials, indicates that for small scattering angles both these quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on the spin asymmetry decrease with energy above 200 MeV and can mostly be neglected at high energies. Examples are given for the 12C and 208Pb nuclei. While our results disagree with the measured high-energy spin asymmetry for 12C, they are able to explain the data on 208Pb near 1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Matter Equation of State in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock Approach and Standard Skyrme Energy-Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as the neutron and proton effective masses and their partial-wave and spin-isospin decomposition are analyzed within the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approach. Theoretical uncertainties for all these quantities are estimated by using several phase-shift-equivalent nucleon-nucleon forces together with two types of three-nucleon forces, phenomenological and microscopic. It is shown that the choice of the three-nucleon force plays an important role above saturation density, leading to different density dependencies of the energy per particle. These results are compared to the standard form of the Skyrme energy-density functional and we find that it is not possible to reproduce the BHF predictions in the $(S,T)$ channels in symmetric and neutron matter above saturation density, already at the level of the two-body interaction, and even more including the three-body interaction.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence an expected phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Glue in hadrons at medium resolution and the QCD instanton vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general framework for the evaluation of the gluonic form factors in light hadrons at low momentum transfer, in the QCD instanton vacuum. At medium resolution of the order of the inverse mean instanton size, the glue is mostly localized in single or pair of pseudoparticles, and globally constrained by the fluctuations of their topological charges. These pseudoparticles trap light quarks, giving rise to emerging multiflavor 't Hooft interactions. We explicitly evaluate the gluonic scalar, pseudoscalar, energy-momentum tensor (EMT), and the leading C-odd and C-even three gluons hadronic form factors, at next to leading order (NLO) in the instanton density, including molecular clusters of like and unlike instantons. We use the results for the EMT to address the contribution of the gluons in Ji$^\prime$s mass and spin sum rules, at low resolution. When evolved, our results for the mass and spin composition of the nucleon, are shown to be in good agreement with the recently reported lattice results at higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reevaluation of $ft$-values in superallowed $\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of the $ft$ values in superallowed nuclear $\beta$ decays crucial for the precise determination of $V_{ud}$ and low-energy tests of the electroweak Standard Model. It consists of the first, fully data-driven analysis of the nuclear $\beta$ decay form factor, that utilizes isospin relations to connect the nuclear charged weak distribution to the measurable charge distributions. This prescription supersedes previous shell-model estimations, and allows for a rigorous quantification of theory uncertainties in $f$ which is absent in the existing literature. Our new evaluation shows an overall downward shift of the central values of $f$ at the level of 0.01\%.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights to the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>$K^+ N$ elastic scatterings for estimation of in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the low-energy $K^+N$ elastic scatterings in the context of the in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks. The chiral ward identity connects the in-medium quark condensate to the soft limit value of the pseudoscalar correlation function evaluated in nuclear matter. The in-medium correlation function of the psuedoscalar fields with strangeness describes in-medium kaon propagation and is obtained by kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in the low density approximation. We construct the kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order and add some terms of the next-to-next-to-leading order with the strange quark mass to improve expansion of the strange quark sector. We also consider the effect of a possible broad resonance state around $P_\mathrm{lab} = 600$ MeV/c for $I=0$ reported in the previous study. The low energy constants are determined by existent $K^+N$ scattering data. We obtain good reproduction of the $K^+p$ scattering amplitude by chiral perturbation theory, while the description of the $KN$ amplitude with $I=0$ is not so satisfactory due to the lack of low energy data. Performing analytic continuation of the scattering amplitudes obtained by chiral perturbation theory to the soft limit, we estimate the in-medium strange quark condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <title>A Light-Front Model for the Transition Distribution Amplitudes for Backward Timelike Compton Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>
