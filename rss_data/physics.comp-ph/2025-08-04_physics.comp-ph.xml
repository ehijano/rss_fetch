      <title>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based Model-Order Reduction for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Simulation -- Mass-Spring-Damper System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Order Reduction (MOR) based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has proven effective in various applications. Most MOR methods utilizing POD are implemented within a pure Eulerian framework, while significantly less attention has been given to POD in a Lagrangian context. In this paper, we present the POD-MOR of SPH simulations applied to a mass-spring-damper system with two primary objectives: 1. To evaluate the performance of the data-driven POD-MOR approach. 2. To investigate potential methods for accelerating POD-MOR computations. Although the mass-spring-damper system is linear, its SPH implementations are nonlinear, and POD-MOR does not automatically lead to faster computations. Our findings indicate that (1) the POD-MOR effectively reduces the degrees of freedom in the SPH simulations by capturing the essential modes, and (2) in various cases, the acceleration of POD-MOR can be achieved without compromising accuracy. We hope that our results will motivate further investigations into the design of POD-MOR algorithms for nonlinear Lagrangian systems.</description>

      <title>Learning shadows to predict quantum ground state correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational scheme inspired by classical shadow tomography to compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians. Shadow tomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of arbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called snapshots, on copies of the state $\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer expectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\epsilon$ using just $N \sim 3^k \text{log}M /\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are performed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can be considered an efficient representation of the state $\rho$, particularly for estimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed to estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme wherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative ground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the energy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of reduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed to ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying Hilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the underlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further correlations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with numerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is efficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground state.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity electronic structure and properties of InSb: $G_0W_0$ and Bayesian-optimized hybrid functionals and DFT+$U$ approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a refined approach to computing the electronic structure of indium antimonide (InSb) using advanced \textit{ab initio} techniques with the In and Sb $4d^{10}$ semicore electrons included in the valence states. These states are modeled using fully relativistic projector augmented waves (PAW) and optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopotentials. However, standard Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with these pseudopotentials often produce non-physical band inversions and incorrect band gaps at the $\Gamma$-point due to $5p$-$4d$ repulsion and self-interaction errors (SIE). To resolve these issues, we apply a combination of hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) via quasiparticle $G_0W_0$, and DFT+$U$, significantly improving the accuracy of the band structure over previous studies. A Bayesian optimization framework is used to refine key parameters, including the inverse screening length ($\mu$) and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange fraction ($\alpha$) in HSE-based XC functionals, as well as the Hubbard $U$ parameters in DFT+$U$, leading to significantly improved band structure predictions. This approach yields highly precise band gaps, bulk moduli, effective masses, Luttinger parameters, valence bandwidth, and $4d$ band positions, achieving unprecedented agreement with experimental data. The resulting model resolves the long-standing incomplete description of InSb's electronic band structure and provides a transferable computational framework for accurate electronic structure predictions across diverse material systems, offering valuable insights for future electronic, optoelectronic, energy, and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>PnP-DA: Towards Principled Plug-and-Play Integration of Variational Data Assimilation and Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates (1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles. Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</description>

      <title>SmartFlow: A CFD-solver-agnostic deep reinforcement learning framework for computational fluid dynamics on HPC platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a powerful tool for fluid-dynamics research, encompassing active flow control, autonomous navigation, turbulence modeling and discovery of novel numerical schemes. We introduce SmartFlow, a CFD-solver-agnostic framework for both single- and multi-agent DRL algorithms that can easily integrate with MPI-parallel CPU and GPU-accelerated solvers. Built on Relexi and SmartSOD2D, SmartFlow uses the SmartSim infrastructure library and our newly developed SmartRedis-MPI library to enable asynchronous, low-latency, in-memory communication between CFD solvers and Python-based DRL algorithms. SmartFlow leverages PyTorch's Stable-Baselines3 for training, which provides a modular, Gym-like environment API. We demonstrate its versatility via three case studies: single-agent synthetic-jet control for drag reduction in a cylinder flow simulated by the high-order FLEXI solver, multi-agent cylinder wake control using the GPU-accelerated spectral-element code SOD2D, and multi-agent wall-model learning for large-eddy simulation with the finite-difference solver CaLES. SmartFlow's CFD-solver-agnostic design and seamless HPC integration is promising to accelerate RL-driven fluid-mechanics studies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Physics-informed Neural Network: Towards Efficient Learning of High-speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study benchmarks hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQPINN) to model high-speed flows, compared against classical physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and fully quantum neural networks (QNNs). The HQPINN architecture integrates a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with a classical neural network in parallel, trained via a physics-informed loss. Across harmonic, non-harmonic, and transonic benchmarks, HQPINNs demonstrate balanced performance, offering competitive accuracy and stability with reduced parameter cost. Quantum PINNs are highly efficient for harmonic problems achieving the lowest loss with minimal parameters due to their Fourier structure, but struggle to generalize in non-harmonic settings involving shocks and discontinuities. HQPINNs mitigate such artifacts, and with sufficient parameterization, can match the performance of classical models in more complex regimes. Although constrained by current quantum emulation costs and scalability, HQPINNs show promise as general-purpose solvers, offering parameter efficiency with robust fallback behavior, particularly suited for problems where the nature of the solution is not known a-priori.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\"ah\"onen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Berends-Giele recursion for gluons in arbitrary dimensions over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a proof of concept for the computation of pure gluonic amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The implementation relies on the Berends-Giele recursion algorithm and, for the first time on a GPU, enables the numerical computation of amplitudes in an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions and over finite fields. This demonstrates the advantages of hardware acceleration, not only for the computation of tree-level amplitudes for real-radiation processes in four dimensions over complex numbers but also for generating loop integrands for virtual corrections in $d$ dimensions over finite fields. The associated computer program is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning-enhanced deep reinforcement learning for aerodynamic airfoil optimisation subject to structural constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural integrity criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform purely aerodynamic and hybrid aerodynamic/structural shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and aerodynamic improvement, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.</description>
