      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

      <title>Charged Particle Scattering in Renormalizable Pionless Effective Field Theory at Next-to-Leading Order: The $pd$, $dd$, and $p^3\mathrm{He}$ Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a renormalizable pionless effective field theory (Pionless EFT) with a non-perturbative treatment of the Coulomb interaction up to next-to-leading order (NLO) for few-nucleon systems. We extract scattering observables for charged clusters by employing two-, three-, and four-body contact interactions and using the stochastic variational method with a Coulomb-corrected harmonic oscillator trap. Our NLO results yield a $pd$ spin-quartet scattering length and effective range of $a_{pd}^{3/2} = 12.76(29)\,\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_{pd}^{3/2} = 1.17(7)\,\mathrm{fm}$; for $dd$ scattering in the spin-quintet channel, we find $a_{dd}^{2} = 6.26(3)\,\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_{dd}^{2} = 1.41(7)\,\mathrm{fm}$; and for $p^3\mathrm{He}$ scattering, the spin-singlet and spin-triplet channels are characterized by $a_{p^3\mathrm{He}}^0 = 11.26(4)\,\mathrm{fm}$, $r_{p^3\mathrm{He}}^0 = 1.65(26)\,\mathrm{fm}$ and $a_{p^3\mathrm{He}}^1 = 9.06(4)\,\mathrm{fm}$, $r_{p^3\mathrm{He}}^1 = 1.36(25)\,\mathrm{fm}$, respectively. Our predictions exhibit mild cutoff dependence and agree well with existing experimental phase shift analyses and potential model calculations. This demonstrates the predictive power of (Pionless EFT) for charged few-nucleon systems.</description>

      <title>Strangeness production in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$ TeV using various model approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the predictions of various observables for strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$)) and multi-strange hadrons ($\Xi^-$($\overline{\Xi}^+$), $\phi$, and $\Omega^-$($\overline{\Omega}^+$)) using the recently updated 3+1D hydrodynamics-based EPOS4 framework and AMPT model. In this study, we report the transverse momentum (${p_{\rm T}}$) spectra, particle yields (${\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}y}$), and ${p_{\rm T}}$ integrated yield ratios relative to pions for $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$~TeV. The results reveal that there are indications of stronger radial flow in EPOS4 compared to AMPT. We observe a final state multiplicity overlap with small ($p+p$ and $p+Pb$) and large ($Pb+Pb$) collision systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow predictions for identified and strange hadrons in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using model approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report the predictions for the flow observables for different centrality classes in $O+O$ collisions. Our predictions utilize two different approaches, hydrodynamic and transport models, to analyze the behavior of the flow coefficients for identified ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p (\overline{p})$) and strange ($\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm S}$, $\Lambda$ ($\overline{\Lambda}$), $\Omega^{-}$ ($\overline{\Omega}^{+}$), $\Xi^{-}$ ($\overline{\Xi}^{+}$), $\phi$) hadrons. We explore particle-by-particle flow and compare the response of the system to initial conditions across various models, which provide insights into the underlying partonic and hadronic dynamics. The study presents comparisons of flow harmonics with the existing experimental measurements and demonstrates how $O+O$ collisions can serve as a benchmark to understand the transition from small to large systems, contributing to our knowledge of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and collective phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Alpha clustering in warm and dense nuclear matter from heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although light nuclear clusters are known to affect the properties of warm and dilute nuclear matter, their role in warm and dense nuclear matter remains unclear due to the lack of experimental evidence for their modifications by the Mott effect in such an environment. To address this issue, we resort to intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, where light clusters are mainly produced in the transiently formed warm and dense matter. A kinetic approach, which includes dynamically the formation and dissociation of light clusters, is employed to deduce the strength of the Mott effects and the $\alpha$-particle fraction in warm and dense nuclear matter from the light-nuclei yields measured by the FOPI Collaboration in central Au$+$Au collisions at energies of $0.25A$ to $0.6A~\rm GeV$. We find an unexpectedly abundant $\alpha$ clustering in this environment, which will have profound implications for modeling the nuclear equation of state and describing supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scaling in Energy Correlators Beyond the Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD scaling behavior of the small-angle Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC), focusing on the transition between its perturbative pre-confinement and non-perturbative post-confinement regimes. Applying the light-ray Operator Product Expansion (OPE), we develop a formalism that describes the scaling of the EEC with the input energy $Q$ in the transition and the post-confinement region, where the latter quantum scaling is determined by the $J=5$ DGLAP anomalous dimension. A key result of our work is a novel connection between the light-ray OPE and the dihadron fragmentation function (DFF), where we show that the non-perturbative OPE coefficients correspond to moments of the DFF. This finding establishes a new paradigm for studying hadronization. Our theoretical predictions are validated against Monte Carlo simulations for both $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, showing excellent agreement. The potential role of the quantum scaling in the precision determination of $\alpha_s$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Extracting Essential Non-perturbative Information in Jet Invariant Mass via the Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new three-dimensional non-perturbative (NP) function to account for and parameterize the NP contributions in the jet invariant mass spectrum, in addition to the conventional NP mass shift parametrization. By implementing Bayesian analysis on experimental data of the jet invariant mass from exclusive $W/Z+$jet events and inclusive jet events in $pp$ collisions at RHIC and LHC, where collisional energy increases by a factor of up to $65$ from RHIC to LHC, we ensure the analysis covers a wide range of data. For the first time, we simultaneously extract NP contributions from hadronization, initial soft-gluon radiation, and underlying events, based on two different NP prescriptions. We find that the contribution from initial soft-gluon radiation is negligible, and the hadronization effect dominates in the small-$R$ region, while underlying events provide the dominant contribution in the large-$R$ region. Moreover, when only hadronization effects are considered, our results successfully describe the jet mass data measured in $e^+e^-$ collisions, where only hadronization effects are expected to be present. Our work offers quantitative insights into understanding the soft hadronic contribution to jet substructure.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $n \bar{D}_{s0}^*(2317)$ interaction and the issue of elastic unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a neutron with the $\bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance and look at the amplitude below threshold and close above threshold. The study is done from the perspective that the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of $DK$. To study this interaction, we use the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations that considers the $DK$ molecule as the cluster and the neutron as the external particle. We improve the Fixed Center approach to implement elastic unitarity around threshold, which is needed to obtain scattering parameters and to evaluate the $n \bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ correlation function that we determine here. One interesting result of the study is the appearance of a resonant state below threshold with a binding of about 130 MeV and a width of about 80 MeV, which we suggest to look at in reactions measuring the invariant mass of $\pi \Sigma \bar D$. The ALICE collaboration has initiated studies of this type, by looking at the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function, and we can only encourage work in this direction which should provide much valuable information on the nature of many resonant states.</description>

      <title>Di-$J/\psi$ structures from the quark Pauli-blocking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-charmonium scattering states such as $J/\psi J/\psi$, $\eta_cJ/\psi$, and $\eta_c\eta_c$ are investigated by a simplified quark cluster model. It is found that the quark Pauli-principle over the $c\bar c c\bar c$ system causes a rapid increase and a node in the two-meson phase shifts. The increase is not large enough to be regarded as a resonance, but if it is seen experimentally, that is most likely the quark Pauli-blocking effect.</description>

      <title>Learning nuclear cross sections across the chart of nuclides with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to learn how nuclear cross-sections change as we add or remove protons and neutrons. As a proof of principle, we focus on the neutron-induced reactions in the fast energy regime that are the most important in nuclear science and engineering. We use variational autoencoders (VAEs) and implicit neural representations (INRs) to build a learned feature representation space of nuclear cross sections and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We then train graph neural networks (GNNs) on the resulting latent space to leverage the topological information encoded in the chart of isotopes and to capture the variations of cross sections with the number of particles in nuclei. We find that hypernetworks based on INRs significantly outperforms VAEs in encoding nuclear cross-sections. This superiority is attributed to INR's ability to model complex, varying frequency details, which enables lower prediction errors when combined with GNNs. We also observe that GNN optimization is much more successful when performed in the latent space, whether using INRs or VAEs. However VAEs' continuous representation also allows for direct GNN training in the original input space. We leverage these representational learning techniques and successfully predict cross sections for a $17\times17$ block of nuclei with high accuracy and precision. Using clustering algorithms, we map groups of latent vectors into regions of the nuclear chart and show that VAEs and INRs can discover some of the neutron magic numbers. These findings suggest that deep-learning models based on representation encoding of cross-sections combined with graph neural networks hold significant potential in augmenting nuclear theory models, e.g., providing reliable estimates of covariances of cross sections, including cross-material covariances.</description>

      <title>Violation of NCQ scaling in hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-7.7GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow for various hadrons in non-central Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0\text{--}7.7\,\mathrm{GeV}\) using the AMPT model with string melting (SM) and pure hadron cascade (HC) modes. For the SM case, NCQ scaling is absent at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\) but is largely restored by \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.9\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Although quark coalescence occurs at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the lack of NCQ scaling is attributed to the insufficient development of quark elliptic flow and the limited production of strange quarks and antiquarks. This finding suggests that NCQ scaling could not be considered a definitive signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in the RHIC fixed-target energy region. For the HC case, as expected, no NCQ scaling is observed. However, a mass ordering in the elliptic flow emerges at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} =4.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), indicating that full thermalization may not be a prerequisite for mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Simulating Nuclear Effective Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum resources to realize this potential, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. Within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. For the latter, we consider both static pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to non-relativistic nucleons. Within these models, we examine the resource costs for the tasks of time evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT, and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and quantum phase estimation. We find that the pionless EFT is the least costly to simulate, followed by the one-pion-exchange theory, then the dynamical-pion theory. We demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be utilized to obtain tighter error bounds. By retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. In the process, we develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic number-preserving Hamiltonians, and obtain tighter Trotter error bounds by explicitly computing nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. Compared to previous estimates for the pionless EFT, our results represent an improvement by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light scattering in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions: Estimating inelastic contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical estimations lead to cross-sections for $AA \to \gamma \gamma AA$ which are somewhat smaller than the measured ones by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, which motivates the searching and calculation of subleading corrections disregarded in these previous studies. In this paper, we estimate for the first time the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions (UPHICs), in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \to \gamma \gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are rather difficult to identify at the LHC and may be misinterpreted as enhanced $\gamma \gamma \to \gamma \gamma$ scattering compared to the Standard Model result. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach here). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon PDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. We find that for the ATLAS acceptance region the inelastic corrections grow with $M_{\gamma \gamma}$ and rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can be of the order of 20-40 \% of the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions. Uncertainties due to factorization scale choice are quantified.</description>

Abstract: We derive the chiral kinetic theory in a non-Abelian gauge field using a self-consistent semiclassical expansion. Within this new expansion scheme, we disentangle the Wigner equations up to second order and demonstrate that they do not introduce additional constraint equations. By integrating the covariant chiral kinetic equations in eight-dimensional phase space, we obtain the corresponding equations in seven-dimensional phase space. This reduction facilitates numerical simulations and practical applications.</description>
