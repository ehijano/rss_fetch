      <description>arXiv:2408.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of hyperbolic conservation laws regularised by including diffusive and dispersive terms, we study monotone travelling waves for the generalised Rosenau-Korteweg de Vries equation.

      <title>The Lake equation as a supercritical mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study so-called supercritical mean-field limits of systems of trapped particles moving according to Newton's second law with either Coulomb/super-Coulomb or regular interactions, from which we derive a $\mathsf{d}$-dimensional generalization of the Lake equation, which coincides with the incompressible Euler equation in the simplest setting, for monokinetic data. This supercritical mean-field limit may also be interpreted as a combined mean-field and quasineutral limit, and our assumptions on the rates of these respective limits are shown to be optimal. Our work provides a mathematical basis for the universality of the Lake equation in this scaling limit -- a new observation -- in the sense that the dependence on the interaction and confinement is only through the limiting spatial density of the particles. Our proof is based on a modulated-energy method and takes advantage of regularity theory for the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a bounded, analytic, and simply connected domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2.$ We show that all analytic steady states of the Euler equations with stream function $\psi$ are either radial or solve a semi-linear elliptic equation of the form $\Delta \psi = F(\psi)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In particular, if $\Omega$ is not a ball, then there exists a one to one correspondence between analytic steady states of the Euler equations and analytic solutions of equations of the form $\Delta \psi = F(\psi)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the general defocusing and focusing $p\times q$ matrix nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equations with initial data allowing arbitrary-order poles and spectral singularities. By establishing the $L^{2}$-Sobolev space bijectivity of the direct and inverse scattering transforms associated with a $(p+q)\times(p+q)$ matrix spectral problem, we prove that both defocusing and focusing matrix NLS equations are globally well-posed in the weighted Sobolev space $H^{1,1}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Dispersive blow-up for solutions to three dimensional generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the dispersive blow up phenomena of the solutions of three dimensional generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations. In particular, we construct smooth initial data such that, the associated global solutions fail to be $C^{1}$ at time $t$ in a null set containing all rational numbers, but are $C^{1}$ at all times $t$ which are generic irrational numbers. The key ingredient are to construct linear solutions which exhibit such phenomena and to prove nonlinear smoothing estimates for the full nonlinear model.</description>

      <title>The propagation of regularity and dispersive blow-up phenomenon to higher-order generalized KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some special properties of smoothness and singularity concerning to the initial value problem associated with higher-order generalized KdV equations are investigated. On one hand, we show the propagation of regularity phenomena. More precisely, the regularity of initial data on the right-hand side of the real line is propagated to the left-hand side with infinite speed under the higher-order KdV flow. On the other hand, we show that the dispersive blow-up phenomenon will occur by constructing a class of smoothing initial data such that global solutions with the given initial data keep smooth at positive generic irrational times, while global solutions display singularity at each time-space positive rational point. The blow-up phenomenon is exclusively caused by the linear part of solutions due to the focusing of short or long waves.</description>

      <title>A bifurcation and multiplicity result for a critical growth elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Br\'ezis-Nirenberg type critical growth $p$-Laplacian problem involving a parameter $\mu &gt; 0$ in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$. We prove the existence of multiple nontrivial solutions if either $\mu$ or the volume of $\Omega$ is sufficiently small. The proof is based on an abstract critical point theorem that only assumes a local $(\text{PS})$ condition. Our results are new even in the semilinear case $p = 2$.</description>

      <title>Global derivation of the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation from quantum many-body dynamics with screened Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1D quantum many-body dynamics with a screened Coulomb potential in the mean-field setting. Combining the quantum mean-field, semiclassical, and Debye length limits, we prove the global derivation of the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation. We tackle the difficulties brought by the pure state data, whose Wigner transforms converge to Wigner measures. We find new weighted uniform estimates around which we build the proof. As a result, we obtain, globally, stronger limits, and hence the global existence of solutions to the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation subject to such Wigner measure data, which satisfy conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, despite being measure solutions. This happens to solve the 1D case of an open problem regarding the conservation law of the Vlasov-Poisson equation raised in [18] by Diperna and Lions.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions for degenerate/singular fully nonlinear integro-differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a series of regularity results for solutions of a degenerate/singular fully nonlinear integro-differential equation
  $$- \bigg( \sigma_{1}(|Du|) + a(x) \sigma_{2}(|Du|) \bigg) I_{\tau}(u,x) = f(x).$$ In the degenerate case, we establish borderline regularity provided the inverse of degeneracy law is Dini-continuous. In addition, we show Schauder-type higher regularity at local extrema point for a concrete non-local degenerate equation. In the singular case, we prove gradient H\"{o}lder regularity of solutions to general non-local equation. It is noteworthy that these results are new even for the case $ a(x) \equiv 0 $. Finally, as a byproduct of the borderline regularity, we show how to apply our strategies in the study of the corresponding regularity for a class of degenerate non-local normalized $ p$-Laplacian equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>An Integral Approach to Prescribing Scalar Curvature Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an integral approach to obtain interior a priori $C^{1,1}$ estimates for convex solutions of prescribing scalar curvature equations $\sigma_2(\kappa) = f(x)$ as well as the Hessian equations $\sigma_2(D^2u) = f(x)$. This new approach can deal with the case when $f$ is of weaker regularity. As a result, we prove that the $C^{1,1}$ modules of the solutions depend only on the Lipschitz modules of $f(x)$, instead of the $\|f\|_{C^k}$ for some $k\geq 2$ in all the papers we have known up to now.</description>

      <title>Phase sinks and sources around two-dimensional periodic-wave solutions of reaction-diffusion-advection systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a complete stability theory for two-dimensional periodic traveling waves of reaction-diffusion systems. More precisely, we identify a diffusive spectral stability assumption, prove that it implies nonlinear stability and provide a sharp asymptotic description of the dynamics resulting from both localized and critically nonlocalized perturbations. In particular, we show that the long-time behavior is governed at leading order by a second-order Whitham modulation system and elucidate how the intertwining of diffusive and dispersive effects may enhance decay rates. The latter requires a non trivial extension of the large-time estimates for constant-coefficient hyperbolic-parabolic operators to some classes of systems with no particular structure, including on one hand systems with a scalar-like - but not scalar - hyperbolic part and a cross-diffusion, and on the other hand anisotropic systems with dispersion.</description>

      <title>Systems of conservation laws in higher space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing paradox between theory and computational experiment for weak solutions of systems of conservation laws in higher space dimensions is arguably resolved. Apparently successful computations are identified with underlying boundary-value problems which are well-posed only in a weakened sense. In the absence of hyperbolicity in particular, prescribed boundary data sufficient to determine an a priori bound for an entropy weak solution need not suffice to imply local uniqueness thereof. In this context, fluid flow models based on stationary or self-similar reductions of Euler systems are distinguished as particularly attractive for computational investigation.</description>

      <title>On a Fujita critical time-fractional semilinear heat equation in the uniformly local weak Zygmund type space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive sufficient conditions on initial data for the local-in-time solvability of a time-fractional semilinear heat equation with the Fujita exponent in a uniformly local weak Zygmund type space. It is known that the time-fractional problem with the Fujita exponent in the scale critical space $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ exhibits the local-in-time solvability in contrast to the unsolvability of the Fujita critical classical semilinear heat equation. Our new sufficient conditions take into account the fine structure of singularities of the initial data, in order to show a natural correspondance between the time-fractional and the classical case for the local-in-time solvability. We also apply our arguments to life span estimates for some typical initial data.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic evolution of Orlicz-Sobolev nematic elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the variational model for nematic elastomer proposed by Barchiesi and DeSimone with the director field defined on the deformed configuration under general growth conditions on the elastic density. This leads us to consider deformations in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. Our work builds upon a previous paper by Henao and the Second Author, and extends their analysis to the quasistatic setting. The overall strategy parallels the one devised by the First author in the case of Sobolev deformations for a similar model in magnetoelasticity. We prove two existence results for energetic solutions in the rate-independent setting. The first result concerns quasistatic evolutions driven by time-dependent applied loads. For this problem, we establish suitable Poincar\'{e} and trace inequalities in modular form to recover the coercivity of the total energy. The second result ensures the existence of quasistatic evolution for both time-depend applied loads and boundary conditions under physical confinement. In its proof, we follow the approach advanced by Francfort and Mielke based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and we implement it for energies comprising terms defined on the deformed configuration. Both existence results rely on a compactness theorem for sequences of admissible states with uniformly bounded energy which yields the strong convergence of the composition of the nematic fields with the corresponding deformations. While proving it, we show the regular approximate differentiability of Orlicz-Sobolev maps with suitable integrability, thus generalizing a classical result for Sobolev maps due to Goffman and Ziemer.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Interface Energies with Microscopic Heterogeneities: Homogenization and Rare Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Allen-Cahn functionals with stationary ergodic coefficients in the regime where the length scale $\delta$ of the heterogeneities is much smaller (microscopic) than the interface width $\epsilon$ (mesoscopic). In the main result, we prove that if the ratio $\delta \epsilon^{-1}$ decays fast enough compared to $\epsilon$, then homogenization effects dominate, and the $\Gamma$-limit of the energy is the same as if the coefficients had been replaced by their homogenized values. As a byproduct of the proof, this implies that homogenization holds in the periodic setting whenever $\delta \epsilon^{-1}$ vanishes with $\epsilon$, no matter how slowly. Via explicit examples, we prove this is sharp: if $\delta \epsilon^{-1}$ decays too slowly, then improbable or atypical local configurations of the medium begin to play a role, and the $\Gamma$-limit may be smaller than the one predicted by homogenization theory. We refer to this as the rare events regime, and we prove that it can occur in both random and almost periodic media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies solutions to a singular $SU(3)$ Toda system with linear source terms on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with smooth boundaries $\partial\Sigma$. We establish the existence of solutions when the parameters are not critical, assuming that Euler characteristic $\chi(\Sigma)&lt;1$ via analyzing the sublevels. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition that ensures multiple solutions for generic potentials by Morse inequalities and a transversality theorem.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Method for Particle Approximation of the Landau Equation for Maxwellian Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for Maxwellian molecules from a natural stochastic interacting particle system. More precisely, we control the relative entropy between the joint law of the particle system and the tensorized law of the Landau equation. To obtain this, we establish as key tools the pointwise logarithmic gradient and Hessian estimates of the density function and also a new Law of Large Numbers result for the particle system. The logarithmic estimates are derived via the Bernstein method and the parabolic maximum principle, while the Law of Large Numbers result comes from crucial observations on the control of moments at the particle level.</description>

      <title>On the Initial Value Problem for Hyperbolic Systems with Discontinuous Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic systems of the first and higher-order partial differential equations appear in many multiphysics problems. We will be dealing with a wave propagation problem in a piece-wise homogeneous medium. Mathematically, the problem is reduced to analyzing two systems of partial differential equations posed on two domains with a common boundary. The differential equations may not be satisfied on the boundary (or part of the boundary), but some interface conditions are satisfied. These interface conditions depend on a specific physical problem. We aim to prove the existence and regularity of the solution for the case of hyperbolic systems of first-order equations with different domains separated by a hyperplane, where we need to formulate the interface conditions. We do this for the initial value problem in 1D-space variable when the coefficient matrix has discontinuity on $m$ lines. More specifically, we find explicit solutions to the case when the coefficient matrix is piecewise constant with a discontinuity along $1$ line or $2$ lines. We also prove the existence of solution to the general initial value problem. We then formulate the weak solution of initial value problem for the corresponding symmetric hyperbolic system in $n $D-space variables with interface conditions, get the energy estimates for this system, and prove the existence of solution to the system.</description>

      <title>Linearization of finite-strain poro-visco-elasticity with degenerate mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasistatic nonlinear model for finite-strain poro-visco-elasticity is considered in the Lagrangian frame using Kelvin-Voigt rheology. The model consists of a mechanical equation which is coupled to a diffusion equation with a degenerate mobility. Having shown existence of weak solutions in a previous work, the focus is first on showing boundedness of the concentration using Moser iteration. Afterwards, it is assumed that the external loading is small, and it is rigorously shown that solutions of the nonlinear, finite-strain system converge to solutions of the linear, small-strain system.</description>

      <title>Long-time stability of a stably stratified rest state in the inviscid 2D Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the nonlinear stability on a timescale $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ of a linearly, stably stratified rest state in the inviscid Boussinesq system on $\mathbb{R}^2$. Here $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denotes the size of an initially sufficiently small, Sobolev regular and localized perturbation. A similar statement also holds for the related dispersive SQG equation.
  At the core of this result is a dispersive effect due to anisotropic internal gravity waves. At the linearized level, this gives rise to amplitude decay at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$, as observed in [EW15]. We establish a refined version of this, and propagate nonlinear control via a detailed analysis of nonlinear interactions using the method of partial symmetries developed in [GPW23].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stochastic Laplace equation: Large Deviations and Measure Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a large deviation principle for the strong solution of the p-Laplace equation on unbounded domain driven by small multiplicative Brownian noise is established. The weak convergence approach and the localized time increment estimate plays a crucial role to establish the large deviation principle. Moreover, based on the Girsanov transformation and the standard L2-uniqueness approach, the quadratic transportation cost information inequality is proved for the strong solution to the underlying problem which then implies the measure concentration phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice and minimal surfaces are related to each other through Allen-Cahn equation. In view of the structure of the solutions of the Toda lattice, we find new balancing configuration using techniques of integrable systems. This allows us to construct new singly periodic minimal surfaces. The genus of these minimal surfaces equals $j(j+1)/2-1$. They are natural generalization of the Riemann minimal surfaces, which have genus zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the restriction of a polynomial to a sphere satisfies a Logvinenko-Sereda-Kovrijkine type inequality
  (a specific type of uncertainty relation).
  This implies a spectral inequality for the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which, in turn, yields
  observability and null-controllability with explicit estimates on the control costs for the spherical heat equation that
  are sharp in the large and in the small time regime.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and symmetry breaking for supercritical elliptic problems in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the following semilinear equation in exterior domains \[-\Delta u + u = a(x)|u|^{p-2}u,\qquad u\in H^1_0({A_R}), \] where ${A_R} := \{x\in\mathbb{R}^N:\, |x|&gt;{R}\}$, $N\ge 3$, $R&gt;0$. Assuming that the weight $a$ is positive and satisfies some symmetry and monotonicity properties, we exhibit a positive solution having the same features as $a$, for values of $p&gt;2$ in a suitable range that includes exponents greater than the standard Sobolev critical one. In the special case of radial weight $a$, our existence result ensures multiplicity of nonradial solutions. We also provide an existence result for supercritical $p$ in nonradial exterior domains.</description>

      <title>A counterexample regarding a two-phase problem for harmonic measure in VMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega^+\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a vanishing Reifenberg flat domain such that $\Omega^+$ and $\Omega^-=\mathbb R^{n+1}\setminus\overline {\Omega^+}$ have joint big pieces of chord-arc subdomains and the outer unit normal to $\Omega^+$ belongs to $VMO(\omega^+)$, where $\omega^\pm$ is the harmonic measure of $\Omega^\pm$. Up to now it was an open question if these conditions imply that $\log\dfrac{d\omega^-}{d\omega^+} \in VMO(\omega^+)$. In this paper we answer this question in the negative by constructing an appropriate counterexample in $\mathbb R^2$, with the additional property that the outer unit normal to $\Omega^+$ is constant $\omega^+$-a.e. in $\partial\Omega^+$.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectral inequalities of Schr\"odinger operator in the whole space for different potentials, which can be power growth or continuously vanishing at infinity. The spectral inequalities quantitatively depend on the density of the sensor sets with positive measure, growth rate of the potentials and spectrum (or eigenvalues). One important component in the poof is the adaptation of propagation of smallness argument for gradients in \cite{LM18}. As an application, we apply the spectral inequalities to obtain quantitative observability inequalities for heat equations.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya-Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e. quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller-Lieb-Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to establish the Runge-type approximation in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^s(\Omega))$ for solutions of linear nonlocal wave equations. To achieve this, we extend the theory of very weak solutions for classical wave equations to our nonlocal framework. This strengthened Runge approximation property allows us to extend the existing uniqueness results for Calder\'on problems of linear and nonlinear nonlocal wave equations in our earlier works. Furthermore, we prove unique determination results for the Calder\'on problem of nonlocal wave equations with polyhomogeneous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigen-pair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step withing judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigen-pair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions of a class of Second Order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to solving a class of second order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in the Wasserstein space, associated with mean field control problems involving common noise. The well-posedness of viscosity solutions to the HJB equation under a new notion is established under general assumptions on the coefficients. Our approach adopts the smooth metric developed by Bayraktar, Ekren, and Zhang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (2023)] as our gauge function for the purpose of smooth variational principle used in the proof of comparison theorem. Further estimates and regularity of the metric, including a novel second order derivative estimate with respect to the measure variable, are derived in order to ensure the uniqueness and existence.</description>
