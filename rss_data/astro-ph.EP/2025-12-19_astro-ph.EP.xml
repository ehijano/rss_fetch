      <title>A JWST Transmission Spectrum of the Temperate Sub-Neptune TOI-732 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, JWST has facilitated detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes orbiting M dwarfs, ushering in a new era in the characterization of this intriguing planetary regime. We report the transmission spectrum of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec G395H and MIRI LRS between 0.9-12 $\mu$m. The observations provide evidence for methane (CH$_4$) in a H$_2$-rich atmosphere, at a volume mixing ratio of $\sim$1\%, and non-detection of NH$_3$ and HCN, along with nominal constraints on other prominent molecules H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$, which are typically expected in H$_2$-rich atmospheres. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 250 chemical species and find moderate to strong evidence (up to $\ln B\sim 5.9$, $3.9\sigma$) for additional absorption due to one or more complex molecules including higher-order hydrocarbons and/or sulfur-bearing molecules. The spectral features are strongly degenerate among these molecules and with methane, which we find at $\ln B=3.2-8.8$ (up to $3.0-4.6$$\sigma$) significance. Two complex molecules are preferred with at least moderate evidence ($\ln B \gtrsim 2.5$) in both the near- and mid-infrared, while several others show such evidence in at least one of the two wavelength ranges. The preferred molecules are found in trace quantities on Earth, with no significant sources identified in other planetary atmospheres, requiring future work to assess their physical plausibility in this planet. Future observations are required to resolve the degeneracies and place more robust constraints on these species. We highlight the need for further theoretical and experimental work to robustly characterize the atmospheric and internal composition of TOI-732 c and similar sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Revealing Callisto's Near Subsurface Thermophysical Properties with ALMA Calibration Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal images at different wavelengths probe varying subsurface depths of planetary bodies, and therefore can inform us about their compositions, thermophysical properties, and impact histories. We identified six archival observations of Callisto obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between 2012 July 17 and 2012 November 4 at wavelengths of 0.43-0.47 mm (701.9-641.5 GHz). These wavelengths are shorter than those of nearly all other Callisto ALMA data and are sensitive to subsurface emission at depths (the upper ~cm) between those sounded by millimeter and infrared observations. We estimate the disk-averaged brightness temperature as 133$\pm$15 K, and use a thermophysical mixture model to find that Callisto's thermal emission is best fit by a ~50-50% two-component thermal inertia mixture of $\Gamma_{\text{low}}$~15-40 and $\Gamma_{\text{high}}$~1200-2000 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, consistent with recent ALMA observations of Callisto at longer wavelengths. Finally, we present several previously unpublished Galileo Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) observations of Callisto and derive thermal inertia and spectral emissivity maps using the same model. Altogether, these ALMA and PPR maps improve our understanding of the thermal properties and spatial distribution of Callisto's shallow subsurface regolith, and demonstrate the value of ALMA flux density calibrator data for extending frequency coverage of existing science data.</description>

      <title>A second planetesimal collision in the Fomalhaut system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby star Fomalhaut is orbited by a compact source, Fomalhaut b, which has previously been interpreted as either a dust-enshrouded exoplanet or a dust cloud generated by the collision of two planetesimals. Such collisions are rarely observed but their debris can appear in direct imaging. We report Hubble Space Telescope observations that show the appearance in 2023 of a second point source around Fomalhaut, resembling the appearance of Fomalhaut b twenty years earlier. We interpret this additional source as a dust cloud produced by a recent impact between two planetesimals. The positions and motion of two impact-generated dust clouds over twenty years provide constraints on the collisional dynamics in the debris belt.</description>

      <title>The Sesquinary Catastrophe on Deimos can reconcile its excited past with its dynamically cool present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos are highly debated, and hypotheses include formation from an impact-generated circum-Martian disk or from capture of asteroids. With the impact scenario, Deimos (or its precursors) were formed or were pushed out beyond the synchronous orbit of Mars. Moons interior to the synchronous orbit, including Phobos (or its precursors), would tidally evolve and resonances between these moons could potentially excite Deimos' orbit. This contradicts Deimos' present-day orbit of low eccentricity ($0.00027$) and moderate inclination ($1.8^\circ$ to the Laplace plane). Tidal dissipation within Deimos is too inefficient for eccentricity damping, and without alternative mechanisms, Deimos' present-day orbit places strong constraints on the evolution of any inner moons. We propose that a runaway collisional cascade called the "sesquinary catastrophe'' acts as a natural barrier that prevents Deimos from having a more excited orbit. Using N-body simulations with collisional fragmentation, we show that if Deimos was more excited, it would undergo a sesquinary catastrophe and break apart into a Roche-exterior debris disk. Using a measure of sesquinary orbital excitation called $q$, our simulations and previous works suggest that breakup occurs for $q \gtrsim 8$ on timescales of $\sim 10^{3-4}$ years. If Deimos was destroyed in a sesquinary catastrophe and re-accreted from a (likely collisionally) damped debris disk, it should be a porous sand-pile moon, consistent with its smooth surface. The sesquinary catastrophe can be applied to other Deimos-like planetary moons at $q \gtrsim 8$.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Modeling of DSHARP Dusty Disks: Asymmetric Structures and Inner-Disk Dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution observations of Class II protoplanetary disks frequently reveal annular structures that may indicate the presence of embedded planets. In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Modeling the Martian Induced Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and {\theta}_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the chemistry of temperate exoplanets atmospheres through experimental and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Warm Jupiter Tidal Migration Can Spare Inner Planets; Hot Jupiter Tidal Migration May Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamical survival of short-period inner planets during the high-eccentricity tidal migration of companion exterior giant planets. Using a combination of analytic arguments and N-body simulations including equilibrium tides and general relativistic precession, we find the boundary in parameter space where an inner companion can remain dynamically stable. We find that survival requires a periastron separation exceeding roughly 14 mutual Hill radii at closest approach. Below this threshold, secular eccentricity exchange, orbit crossing, and/or tidal evolution can lead to the destruction of the inner planet. We apply our methodology to the current exoplanet sample and find that none of the known systems containing a short-period giant and an inner companion could have assembled via high-eccentricity tidal migration. However, warm Jupiters with larger periastron distances ($q_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 0.05-0.08$ AU, corresponding to final observed semi-major axis values $a_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 0.10-0.16$ AU) can allow the survival of short-period inner planets while potentially also circularizing on $\lesssim 1$ Gyr timescales. Our results provide a framework for distinguishing disk migration from tidal migration in observed multi-planet systems containing close-in gas giants.</description>

      <title>Probing thermal gradients of habitable-zone rocky planets using direct imaging as an anti-indicator of a global surface ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging missions, such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE), aim to observe thermal emission from potentially habitable planets to characterize their surface environments and search for signs of life. Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using one-dimensional models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature $\sim 280$~K) as a benchmark, we compute three-dimensional atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10~bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics of global temperature contrast, the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but require integration a few times longer. These three-dimensional effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on one-dimensional models. We also assess their detectability for other nearby exoplanets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate three-dimensional atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Expressions for the Potentials and Accelerations of Generalized Ring Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several closed-form expressions of useful mass distributions. These include the potentials and accelerations of circular rings and arcs, the potentials of uniform density rings and arcs at arbitrary eccentricities, and the potentials and accelerations of rings and arcs when the mass is time-averaged over a Kepler orbit. We show that these expressions can be expressed, often simply, in terms of elliptic functions of complex arguments. We show that in a few limiting cases, the expressions are entirely real. We expect that these expressions will allow for more rapid modeling in many areas of celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Observing spatial and temporal variations in the atmospheric chemistry of rocky exoplanets: prospects for mid-infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future telescopes such as the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable mid-infrared characterisation of the atmospheres of nearby rocky exoplanets. Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra.</description>

      <title>Comparison of General Circulation Models of the Venus upper atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of future Venusian missions, it is crucial to improve our understanding of Venus upper atmosphere through 3D modeling, notably for spacecraft orbit computation. This study compares three General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Venusian atmosphere up to the exosphere: the Venus Planetary Climate Model (Venus PCM), the Venus Thermospheric Global Model (VTGCM) and the Tohoku University GCM (TUGCM), focusing on their nominal simulations (e.g. composition, thermal structure and heating/cooling rates). Similarities and discrepancies among them are discussed in this paper, together with data-models comparison. The nominal simulations analyzed in this study fail to accurately reproduce the daytime observations of Pioneer Venus, notably overestimating the exospheric temperature. This is linked to an underestimation of the atomic oxygen (O) abundance in the three GCMs, and suggests the need of additional O production in the thermosphere. The selection of solar spectrum is also the main reason for the discrepancies between the models in terms of temperature dependence on solar activity. A list of recommendations is proposed aiming at improving the modeling of Venus' upper atmosphere, among them: 1. Standardize the EUV-UV solar spectrum input. 2. Update the near-infrared heating scheme with Venus Express-Era data. 3. Reassess Radiative cooling schemes. 4. Investigate the underestimated atomic Oxygen abundance.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Possible Spectral Variability in the Patroclus-Menoetius Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new visible-wavelength spectroscopic observations of the Patroclus-Menoetius binary system in the Jupiter Trojan population. Motivated by previously published spectra from different instruments that showed evidence of significant longitudinal variability, we obtained two spectra spanning 440-680 nm at near-opposite rotational phases with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope during the late 2024 apparition. The same solar analog was used for both observations to remove one source of inconsistency. We measured spectral slopes of 2.51% $\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm and 8.13% $\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm at the two different rotational phases. The first of these measurements was serendipitously obtained during an occultation of Menoetius by Patroclus. Although the statistical significance of the spectral slope discrepancy persists even after considering possible systematic errors stemming from differences in slit position angles and air masses between the asteroid and solar analog exposures, we consider this report of variability to be tentative. We briefly explore several scenarios that could explain the measured spectral slope variability. Additional follow-up observations are necessary to definitively confirm and characterize any inhomogeneities across the surface, which will have major implications for the 2033 flyby of Patroclus-Menoetius by the Lucy spacecraft.</description>

      <title>N-body interactions and collisions in circumstellar disks for planar and inclined binary star configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of exoplanets in binary star systems-now numbering about 850 of the nearly 4,600 known exoplanet systems-raises questions about whether observational bias or stellar companions inhibit planet formation. While most studies on terrestrial planet formation assume planar configurations, wide binaries likely feature random inclinations, potentially disrupting planet-forming disks. This study explores the evolution of embryo-planetesimal disks in S-type motion in misaligned binary systems, focusing on the stage after the gas phase when terrestrial planet formation begins and gravitational interactions dominate. Using our GPU-accelerated N-body code GANBISS, we simulate disks with 2,000 planetesimals and 25 planetary embryos, studying the influence of the planetesimals on the evolution of the embryos and tracking their growth through collisions. After the simulations, we analyse collision outcomes with an analytical model. Moreover, for certain inclined binary configurations, we compare dynamically excited (perturbed by the secondary star) with cold disks in inclined configurations, as the distribution after the gas phase in misaligned binaries remains unclear. Our simulations reveal two key outcomes: (i) embryos migrate slightly inward in misaligned systems, and (ii) The initial large oscillations in embryos' inclinations and nodes around the respective values of the secondary star dampen over time. Collision analysis shows distinct differences: planar systems favour accretive collisions, while inclined configurations exhibit more destructive events. These findings underscore the sensitivity of planet formation dynamics to binary star alignment and initial disk conditions.</description>

      <title>A Radio Search for Star-Planet Interaction in TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first targeted centimeter-band radio observations of two recently-discovered exoplanet systems that are prime candidates for magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI): TOI-540 and SPECULOOS-3. The targets were selected due to the small orbital separation of their known planets, as well as for indications of stellar magnetic activity, given that for SPI radio emission may be strongest when a sufficiently magnetized star hosts a close-in planet. The deep, multi-epoch Very Large Array (SPECULOOS-3) and MeerKAT (TOI-540) observations yield non-detections, with $3\sigma$ limits of $\lesssim 7.5$ $\mu$Jy ($4-8$ GHz) and $\lesssim 30-80$ $\mu$Jy ($0.8-1.7$ GHz), respectively. For SPECULOOS-3 b we rule out observable SPI for most of its orbit, while for TOI-540 b we sample a narrower range, around planetary transit. We model possible planetary magnetic field strength constraints for both systems, and conclude that our observations are sensitive enough to sample SPI emission in these systems if present and directed at us, even for a planetary field of only $\sim 1$ G.</description>

      <title>Hunting exomoons with a kilometric baseline interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous search campaigns based on a diverse set of observational techniques, exomoons - prospective satellites of extrasolar planets - remain an elusive and hard-to-pin-down class of objects. Yet, the case for intensifying this search is compelling: as in the Solar System, moons can act as proxies for studying planet formation and evolution, provide direct clues as to the migration history of the planetary hosts and, in favourable cases, offer potentially habitable environments. Here, we present an investigation into how the search for exomoons would benefit from a new interferometric facility operating in the optical wavelength domain and leveraging baselines substantially longer than the ones the VLTI is currently equipped with. We find that an interferometer providing an astrometric precision of 1$\,\mu$as would be able to robustly detect Earth-mass and sub-Earth-mass exomoons on dynamically stable orbits around Jupiter-like planets at distances between 50 and 200 pc.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a rapidly evolving global magnetic field in the M-dwarf YZ Cet and constraints on the magnetic field of its planet YZ Cet b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectropolarimetric study of the nearby M4.5V exoplanet host star YZ Cet, based on near-infrared observations obtained with the SpectroPolarim\`etre InfraRouge (SPIRou) at the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope. We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field using a Gaussian regression process, which allowed us to robustly determine the stellar rotation period and quantify the evolution timescale of the magnetic field. Independent Zeeman Doppler Imaging reconstructions of the two epochs confirm a significant reconfiguration of the star's global magnetic strength and topology. The detection of a weaker, complex, axisymmetric magnetic field (mean $|B| \sim 201$~G), which changes into a stronger, non-axisymmetric, dipole-dominated field (mean $|B| \sim 276$~G) over a few rotation cycles, is in contrast to results from similar fully convective M-dwarf stars. YZ Cet is known to exhibit polarized radio bursts potentially driven by auroral radio emission from star--planet interaction (SPI). By combining our magnetic maps with recent radio observations, we refine the constraints on the magnetic field strength of the innermost planet, YZ Cet b. These results underscore the importance of monitoring stellar magnetic variability to interpret multi-wavelength SPI signatures and to characterize the magnetospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the sensitivity of ELT to habitable worlds with a space-based starshade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ELT will provide groundbreaking science across a wide range of areas, including small habitable-zone exoplanets; however, true Earth analogs in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars are generally beyond the reach even of the ELT, due to the extreme contrast ratio and small angular separation between the planet and star. Here, we note that the combination of ELT and a space-based starshade would provide the contrast needed to observe potentially tens of Earth analogs, as well as other planets. This would yield the scientific basis needed for addressing central scientific questions regarding the frequency and distribution of habitability and life in the Universe. The huge aperture of ELT, combined with a contrast otherwise only reachable in space, opens up scientific avenues that are unmatched by any other existing or foreseen facility. ESO could conceivably collaborate with ESA (and others) to facilitate a starshade mission suitable for synergy with the ELT, as well as to prepare the ELT instrumentation in order to maximize its potential for synergy with a starshade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be NASA's flagship space telescope of the 2040s, designed to search for life on other planets and to transform broad areas of astrophysics. NASA are seeking international partners, and the UK is well-placed to lead the design and construction of its imaging camera - which is likely to produce the mission's most visible public impact. Early participation in the mission would return investment to UK industry, and bring generational leadership for the UK in space science, space technology, and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Inferring and Interpreting the Visual Geometric Albedo and Phase Function of Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution. Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation -- it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual (0.4--0.7 um) phase-dependent, disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft, alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: $0.242^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$. This albedo constraint is up 30--40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for surface habitability detection, which implies that aerosol forward scattering can effectively mimic an ocean glint signature in broadband visual phase curves. Observations of phase curves for Earth at redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint effects from aerosol forward scattering. Finally, a review of albedos and planetary photometry is provided as well as a simple two-parameter fit to Earth's visual phase curve to ease adoption into other tools.</description>

      <title>JWST occultation reveals unforeseen complexity in Chariklo's ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ring systems have been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information about ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their origins, lifetimes, evolutionary pathways, or compositions. Here we report near-infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by (10199) Chariklo, a Centaur known to host a double-ring system. Our JWST measurements show that Chariklo's inner dense ring has become significantly more opaque than in previous observations, pointing to ongoing replenishment processes or dynamical restructuring. In contrast, the outer ring exhibits a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than seen in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may reflect material loss, suggesting that the outer ring could be transient, or may arise from wavelength-dependent opacity. These scenarios, which are not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, distinct from those observed around any other minor bodies in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Rapid Brightening of 3I/ATLAS Ahead of Perihelion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been approaching its 2025 October 29 perihelion while opposite the Sun from Earth, hindering ground-based optical observations over the preceding month. However, this geometry placed the comet within the fields of view of several space-based solar coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, enabling its continued observation during its final approach toward perihelion. We report photometry from STEREO-A's SECCHI HI1 and COR2, SOHO's LASCO C3, and GOES-19's CCOR-1 instruments in 2025 September--October, which show a rapid rise in the comet's brightness scaling with heliocentric distance r as r^(-7.5+/-1.0). CCOR-1 also resolves the comet as an extended source with an apparent coma ~4' in diameter. Furthermore, LASCO color photometry shows the comet to be distinctly bluer than the Sun, consistent with gas emission contributing a substantial fraction of the visible brightness near perihelion.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec finds no clear signs of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the prevalence of atmospheres on terrestrial planets is a core objective in exoplanetary science. While M dwarf systems offer a promising opportunity, conclusive observations of terrestrial atmospheres have remained elusive, with many yielding flat transmission spectra. We observe four transits of the hot terrestrial planet TOI-1685 b using JWST's NIRSpec G395H instrument. Combining this with the transit from the previously-observed phase curve of the planet with the same instrument, we perform a detailed analysis to determine the possibility of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b. From our retrievals, the Bayesian evidence favours a simple flat line model, indicating no evidence for an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b, in line with results from the phase curve analysis. Our results show that hydrogen-dominated atmospheres can be confidently ruled out. For heavier, secondary atmospheres we find a lower limit on the mean molecular weight of ~10, at a significance of ~5 sigma. Pure CO2, SO2, H2O, and CH4 atmospheres, or a mixed secondary atmosphere (CO+CO2+SO2) could explain the data (Delta lnZ &lt; 3). However, pure CH4 atmospheres may be physically unlikely, and the pure H2O and CO2 cases require a high-altitude cloud, which could also be interpreted as a thin cloud-free atmosphere. We discuss the theoretical possibility for different types of atmosphere on this planet, and consider the effects of atmospheric escape and stellar activity on the system. Though we find that TOI-1685 b is likely a bare rock, this study also highlights the challenges of detecting secondary atmospheres on rocky planets with JWST.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</description>
