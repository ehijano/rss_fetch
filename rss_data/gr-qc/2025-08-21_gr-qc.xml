      <title>Tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that black holes in four-dimensional, vacuum, general relativity exhibit vanishing static tidal Love numbers, indicating no multipolar response to the external tidal fields in the static limit. This intriguing feature does not extend to higher-dimensional spacetimes within general relativity, where static black holes can possess non-zero static tidal Love numbers (TLNs). In this work, we have examined the tidal deformation of black holes in Lovelock gravity. We find that, in certain cases within pure Lovelock gravity, the static TLN vanishes, extending the four-dimensional result to specific higher-dimensional settings. On the other hand, black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity consistently exhibit non-zero static TLNs, with their magnitude depending on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Exceptions occur only in certain special cases associated with axial perturbations. These results highlight the sensitivity of the multipolar response of a black hole under tidal field, to the underlying theory of gravity and the spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Infrared Extended Uncertainty Principle Corrections and Quintessence-Induced Topology of Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified topological and geometric analysis of charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes immersed in a quintessence field, incorporating infrared gravitational corrections arising from the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The latter modifies the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation by introducing a minimal momentum/maximal length scale, which effectively captures long-wavelength quantum gravitational effects relevant to black hole thermodynamics in curved spacetimes. We derive analytic expressions for the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity in terms of the EUP deformation parameter. Furthermore, the inclusion of quintessence, characterized by barotropic indices \(\omega_q = -\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\omega_q = -\frac{1}{3}\), modifies the black hole metric function. By studying the relaxation-time function $\tau(r_h)$, we identify a number of inflection points that depends sensitively on the equation of state parameter of quintessence, indicating a nontrivial impact of the latter on the black hole phase structure. Applying Duan's topological current method to the off-shell free energy, we compute integer-valued winding numbers associated with each thermodynamic critical point. A parallel topological analysis of the photon sphere assigns charges \( \pm 1 \) to individual light rings, showing that quintessence effects can trigger the splitting or merging of photon spheres, while preserving the total exterior topological charge of $-1$.</description>

      <title>The non-orientable spacetime of the eternal black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the metric of the BTZ black hole for the special case of interchanging the characteristics of space and time coordinates. We maximally extend the geometry of this interior solution and show that the line element is similar to its exterior solution counterpart. Thus, we assign the thermofield double state dual to this interior geometric construction. As a result, we have two independent thermofield double states corresponding to the BTZ metric: one dual to the exterior solution and one dual to the interior solution. In this scenario, considering both thermofield double states as dual to the full BTZ black hole, we evaluate the partition function of the bulk. The partition function represents a non-orientable spacetime. Additionally, we derive a thermofield double-like state that connects in the gravity dual the regions of spacetime with opposite orientations of space and time.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Parameters in f(R,T) Gravity and Comparison with Type Ia Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the Universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity is studied. We consider functions of the form $f(R,T)=R+\lambda T^\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&lt;1$. We find that for all models with $\epsilon&lt;0$, the Universe transitions to exponential growth at late times, just as it does in the standard cosmological model, which corresponds to $\epsilon=0$. It also fits the type Ia supernova data slightly better than the standard cosmological model, without increasing the number of parameters of the theory. In contrast, the fits for $\epsilon &gt;0$ rapidly become worse than the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical Study on the Polarized Images of Black Hole due to Frame Dragging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An initially retrograde accretion flow is transformed into a prograde configuration before plunging into the black hole, as a result of the frame-dragging effect induced by the black hole's rotation. The polarized image of a black hole shaped by such an accretion flow manifests three distinctive critical locations: the turning point of the flow's primary image, the polarization-flip location on the image plane, and the position of the primary image corresponding to the flow's actual turning point in spacetime. Due to the influences of gravitational lensing and gravitational Faraday rotation, these three positions generally do not coincide. In this work, we examine a thin equatorial accretion disk composed of initially retrograde, geodesically moving flows, and conduct a systematic investigation into the interrelations and discrepancies among these critical locations. We elucidate the spatial hierarchy among the three, and for an on-axis observer, we derive approximate analytic expressions characterizing their positions.</description>

      <title>Future stability of solutions of the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system with decelerated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear scalar field with exponential potential. This system admits Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker solutions undergoing decelerated expansion, with $\mathbb{T}^3$ spatial topology and scale factor $a(t) = t^p$ for $1/3 &lt; p &lt; 1$. For each $p \in (2/3,1)$, we prove that the corresponding FLRW spacetime is future-stable as a solution to the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system. Given initial data on a spacelike hypersurface that is sufficiently close to the FLRW data, we show the resulting solution is future-causal geodesically complete, and remains close to the FLRW solution for all time. Moreover, we show the perturbed metric components and scalar field converge to spatially homogeneous functions as $t \rightarrow \infty$. A key feature of our analysis is the decomposition of the metric and scalar field perturbations into their spatial averages and oscillatory remainders with zero average.</description>

      <title>More on Bianchi I spacetimes and f(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole population inference combining confident and marginal events from the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ search pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the population properties of binary black hole mergers identified by the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ pipeline (which incorporates higher-order modes in the search templates) during the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with quintessence matter on the EGUP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum correction on thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the presence of the quintessence matter associated with dark energy. To this end, the modified Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy functions of the black hole are derived. { Investigation reveals that the modified uncertainty principles and normalization factor $\alpha$ restrict the lower bound value of horizon radius to affect the Hawking temperature and the parameter $\eta_{0}$ have a non-negligible effect on the heat capacity threshold.} {Furthermore}, the correction of entropy does not depend on the quintessence matter. It is also examined the equation of state associated with the pressure and the volume in this framework. In addition, we employ graphical methods to compare and discuss the findings within the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and extended uncertainty principle (EUP).</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of Scalar Hair in Black Hole Bombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed a novel nonlinear mechanism, distinct from the linear superradiant instability, which triggers the black hole bomb phenomenon. Introducing a massive complex scalar field with nonlinear self-interactions drives the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to shed substantial energy, thereby triggering a black hole bomb. Radial oscillations in the scalar hair profile are observed during this process. In this paper, we further reveal that physical quantities associated with scalar hair exhibit identical oscillation patterns during the evolution of the black hole-scalar field system. Moreover, the oscillation frequency exhibits a linear dependence on the gauge coupling constant of the scalar field with other parameters fixed. Meanwhile, the horizon radius of hairy black holes and the mass within the horizon increase monotonically with the gauge coupling constant. We have also identified a critical initial charge value that distinguishes hairy solutions that trigger black hole bombs from those that do not.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy of collapsing and merging neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of "dirty black holes". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into "clean", "modified", and "distorted" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quasi-periodic oscillation data from selected X-ray binary systems hosting black holes. To model the spacetime geometry, we resort the static Sen solution -- originally derived in the framework of heterotic string theory -- which reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime for vanishing electric charge. By fitting the observed frequencies within the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass and charge parameters of the Sen black hole and discuss their astrophysical implications, particularly in distinguishing classical black holes from their string-inspired counterparts.</description>

      <title>Energy conditions for regular black holes in EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good description of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature below the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective field theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's gravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's gravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the question of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like black holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution supporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor cube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies positivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy condition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular solutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object, given that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off scale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the horizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases.</description>

Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemanian setting, standard \em{pointed} convergence is strenghtened to \em{anchored} convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorenzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness and simple connectedness. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on its own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework in which classical gravity arises from stress-tensor deformations of quantum field theories (QFTs). By expressing the deformed partition function as a gravitational path integral, we propose an equivalent description between a seed QFT coupled to gravity and an effective field theory defined on a deformation-induced metric. This approach, which does not rely on holography or extra dimensions, applies to a variety of gravitational models, including Einstein and Palatini gravity. The deformation parameter acts as a coupling to the emergent geometry, linking stress-energy dynamics to spacetime curvature. The framework provides a calculable, dimension-independent method for studying gravitational theories resulting from QFT deformations.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational wave dark sirens to choose between host galaxy weighting models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.</description>

      <title>Cosmological pole-skipping, shock waves and quantum chaotic dynamics of de Sitter horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of pole-skipping for scalar, Maxwell, and gravitational waves in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, working in empty de Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate the tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing on the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum chaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a gravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant pole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta. Interestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary, with the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming that a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory language and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled sectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly nonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector exhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we outline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian deformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that realize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that future timelike infinity ($i^+$) in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is conformal to the unit three-dimensional hyperboloid ($H^3$). We asymptotically expand massive fields with spin $0,1,2$ near $i^+$ and extrapolate them onto this hyperboloid. These fields oscillate with a frequency equal to their mass and exhibit a universal asymptotic decay $\tau^{-3/2}$. The fundamental fields are free and encode the outgoing scattering data. They are local operators defined on the boundary $H^3$ with which we construct the Poincar\'e charges. The Poincar\'e algebra can be extended to $\text{MDiff}(H^3)\ltimes C^{\infty}(H^3)$ using smeared operators associated with energy and angular momentum densities. For spinning fields, a spin operator must be included to close the algebra. The extended algebra shares the same form as the five-dimensional intertwined Carrollian diffeomorphism and reduces to the BMS algebra at $i^+$ by restricting the choice of test functions and vectors.</description>

      <title>Formation of heavy double neutron stars I: Eddington-limited accretion for a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star at solar metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community.
  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step towards the realization of a nanodiamond spatial interferometer.

      <description>arXiv:2410.00383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of compact, anisotropic stellar structures through the gravitational decoupling scheme within the framework of complete geometric deformation. The study introduces a novel synthesis of two independent techniques, namely the zero-complexity factor and density-like constraints, applied simultaneously to determine the deformation functions. This dual implementation represents a new methodological step in stellar modeling, as it allows us to explicitly control the role of anisotropy and complexity in the internal structure of self-gravitating objects. Starting from a chosen metric ansatz as a seed solution, we demonstrate that the zero-complexity condition captures the gravitational response of compact matter in a fully tractable form. The complete deformation procedure then yields two new physically viable anisotropic solutions, passing all standard stability and energy condition tests. Our results show, for the first time, that the direction of energy transfer between the seed sector and the decoupled source is uniquely governed by the deformation parameter, providing direct physical insight into the coupling between known and generic gravitational fields. Furthermore, we find that anisotropy plays a decisive role in the stability criteria of these stars, highlighting its nontrivial influence on realistic stellar evolution. These results offer a new perspective on the modeling of high-density stellar interiors and open a pathway for extending gravitational decoupling analyses to more complex astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Big Bang as spacetime defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-Big-Bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The observation image of a soliton boson star illuminated by various accretions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the observable signatures of solitonic boson stars by employing ray-tracing simulations, with celestial spheres and thin accretion disks serving as illumination sources. By numerically fitting the metric form, we solve the geodesic equation for photons under the influence of the soliton potential, enabling us to simulate the optical appearance of the soliton boson star in two distinct regimes. In the weak coupling case (larger value of coupling parameter $\alpha$) with an initial scalar field $\psi_0$, the images on the screen predominantly show direct and lensed images, where $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ modulate the image region size while the observation inclination $\theta$ controls morphological asymmetry. In the case of strong coupling (small value of $\alpha$), the images on the screen show a nested sub-annulus within the Einstein ring in the celestial model, whereas thin disk accretion models reveal higher-order lensing images indicative that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the correlation parameter. At low inclination($\theta&lt;30^{\circ})$, the redshift is the dominant effect, the image is characterized by a dim central cavity enclosed by a bright ring. At high inclination ($\theta&gt;60^{\circ})$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as a Killing horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Exact plane symmetric black bounce with a perfect-fluid exterior obeying a linear equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an exact two-parameter family of plane symmetric solutions admitting a hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector in general relativity with a perfect fluid obeying a linear equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ in $n(\ge 4)$ dimensions, obtained by Gamboa in 2012. The Gamboa solution is identical to the topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-(anti-)de~Sitter $\Lambda$-vacuum solution for $\chi=-1$ and admits a nondegenerate Killing horizon only for $\chi=-1$ and $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$. We identify all possible regular attachments of two Gamboa solutions for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ at the Killing horizon without a lightlike thin shell, where $\chi$ may have different values on each side of the horizon. We also present the maximal extension of the static and asymptotically topological Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Gamboa solution, realized only for $\chi\in(-(n-3)/(3n-5),0)$, under the assumption that the value of $\chi$ is unchanged in the extended dynamical region beyond the horizon. The maximally extended spacetime describes either (i) a globally regular black bounce whose Killing horizon coincides with a bounce null hypersurface or (ii) a black hole with a spacelike curvature singularity inside the horizon. The matter field inside the horizon is not a perfect fluid but rather an anisotropic fluid that can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. A fine-tuning of the parameters is unnecessary for the black bounce, but the null energy condition is violated everywhere except on the horizon. In the black-bounce (black-hole) case, the metric in the regular coordinate system is $C^\infty$ only for $\chi=-1/(1+2N)$ with odd (even) $N$ satisfying $N&gt;(n-1)/(n-3)$, and if one of the parameters in the extended region is fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>On quantum creation of a toroidal universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole for string, but not for particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed string massless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the string frame, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence of the wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middle region contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions form non-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin to a non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete within each region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometry differently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.</description>

      <title>Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. Also, the role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous works characterizing GRW space-times using concircular and torse-forming vectors, this paper investigates a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection. We demonstrate that such a manifold reduces to a GRW space-time under specific conditions: when the generator of the observed connection is a unit timelike vector. Also, in that case, the mentioned connection becomes a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection. The non-zero nature of the three curvature tensors and their corresponding Ricci tensors motivates an exploration of manifold symmetries. In this way, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the manifold to be Einstein and we prove that a perfect fluid space-time with a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection is Ricci pseudo-symmetric manifold of constant type. Furthermore, we show that if this space-time satisfies the Einstein's field equations without the cosmological constant, the strong energy condition is violated.</description>

      <title>Study of the Connected Four-Point Correlation Function of Galaxies from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the non-Gaussian four-point correlation function (4PCF) from the DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. For the gravitationally induced parity-even 4PCF, we detect a signal with a significance of 14.7$\sigma$ using our fiducial setup. We assess the robustness of this detection through a series of validation tests, including auto- and cross-correlation analyses, sky partitioning across multiple patch combinations, and variations in radial scale cuts. Due to the low completeness of the sample, we find that differences in fiber assignment implementation schemes can significantly impact estimation of the covariance and introduce biases in the data vector. After correcting for these effects, all tests yield consistent results. This is one of the first measurements of the connected 4PCF on the DESI LRG sample: the good agreement between the simulation and the data implies that the amplitude of the density fluctuation inferred from the connected 4PCF is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The methodology and diagnostic framework established in this work provide a foundation for interpreting parity-odd 4PCF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a constructive gravitational dual of two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs) grounded in their two-dimensional gravity description. This framework can be viewed as a Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld, where two-dimensional gravity localized on the $AdS_3$ boundary is dynamical. Assuming the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic dictionary provides a straightforward translation between the $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and its gravitational dual. In particular, this $T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography remains valid in the presence of matter. To clarify how our framework relates to -- and differs from -- the cutoff AdS proposal, we examine, in the absence of matter, the effect of dynamical boundary gravity on the bulk geometry. In general, semiclassical integration of the boundary two-dimensional gravity -- weighted by the massive gravity action -- leads to a deformation of the two-dimensional metric on constant-radial surfaces. However, we find that the surface commonly interpreted as the cutoff emerges dynamically as a characteristic bulk surface on which the deformation is neutralized. This perspective opens the door to possible extensions of our framework to incorporate matter effects on the bulk surface in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that the common identification of time with entropy is a category error. Entropy accounts for the arrow of time but not for time itself. Even in a maximally entropic universe the so called heat death temporal structure persists, grounded in the correlations of the quantum vacuum and the geometry of spacetime. The twilight of time is not its disappearance but its loss of directionality.</description>
