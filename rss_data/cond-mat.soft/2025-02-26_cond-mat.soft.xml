      <title>Mesoscale Modeling of an Active Colloid's Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses Cahn-Hilliard equations as a mesoscale model of the motion of active colloids. The model attempts to capture the driving mechanisms and qualitative behavior of the isotropic colloids originally proposed by J. Decayeaux in 2021. We compare our model against the single colloid behavior presented in that work, as well as against multi-colloid systems.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Magnus effect in polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating particles moving in fluids undergo a transverse migration via the inertia-induced Magnus effect. This phenomenon vanishes at colloidal scales because inertia is negligible and the fluid flow is time reversible. Yet, recent experiments discovered an inverse Magnus effect of colloids in polymeric and micellar solutions supposedly because their viscoelasticity breaks the time reversibility. Our study shows that classical viscoelastic features -- normal-stress differences and/or shear-thinning cannot explain this phenomenon. Instead, it originates from local polymer density inhomogeneities due to their stress-gradient-induced transport, a mechanism increasingly important at smaller scales -- indeed relevant to colloidal experiments. Incorporating this mechanism into our model leads to quantitative agreement with the experiments without fitting parameters. Our work provides new insights into colloidal motion in complex fluids with microstructural inhomogeneities, offers a simple mechanistic theory for predicting the resulting migration, and underscores the necessity of assimilating these findings in future designs of micro-machinery including swimmers, actuators, rheometers, and so on.</description>

      <title>A Peanut-hull-PLA based 3D printing filament with antimicrobial effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peanut hulls, also known as Arachis hypogaea L. particles (AHL), are an abundant biomass source with a long shelf life. In this study, we incorporate peanut hull powder into PLA polymer, imparting recyclability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, along with the antimicrobial properties of AHL particles. In particular, we treat AHL particles as a reinforcement for PLA polymer to produce 3D printing filament compatible with the fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing method. We provide a step-by-step method for preparing AHL particles, incorporating them into PLA, and ultimately forming high-quality filaments. We assess the quality of the filaments in terms of extruded dimensions, mechanical strength, and elastic modulus, along with physical properties such as porosity and melt flow index. We evaluate the printability and wettability of the filaments as well. Notably, and unlike other biomass-based reinforcements in PLA, AHL preserves the filament's strength and enhances its elastic modulus. 3D-printed components fabricated using our PLA-AHL filaments successfully retain their antimicrobial properties and exhibit increased overall hardness. However, this comes at the expense of forming more microvoids and a rougher surface, making the material more prone to fracture and leading to a slight reduction in fracture toughness with increasing AHL mass fraction.</description>

      <title>Seeing the unseen: laser speckles as a tool for coagulation tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to measure protein functionality is critical for the development of plant-based products, particularly with respect to gelation behavior, which is vital for food structure and texture. Small amplitude oscillatory shear tests remain the standard for monitoring protein gelation; however, these methods are costly, time-consuming, and require physical contact with the sample. Laser speckle rheology, an optical-based technique, offers a contactless alternative by assessing rheological properties through speckle pattern fluctuations. In this work, we present a simple laser speckle rheology setup, utilizing a diode laser and a digital camera, to monitor rheological changes during the rennet coagulation of milk. We use a viscoelasticity index, derived from a two-dimensional linear correlation, to quantify speckle pattern fluctuations. The laser speckle rheology method is compared with conventional small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology. Results demonstrate that key characteristics of the coagulation process, including coagulation and gelation times, are temporally aligned between the two methods. Furthermore, the viscoelasticity index allows for the comparison of the complex modulus in samples with similar compositions under consistent acquisition parameters. These findings underscore the potential of laser speckle rheology as a cost-effective, rapid, and contactless approach for capturing protein gelation, providing a viable alternative to conventional shear rheological methods.</description>

      <title>Controllable Interlocking from Irregularity in Two-Phase Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural materials often feature a combination of soft and stiff phases, arranged to achieve excellent mechanical properties, such as high strength and toughness. Many natural materials have even independently evolved to have similar structures to obtain these properties. For example, interlocking structures are observed in many strong and tough natural materials, across a wide range of length scales. Inspired by these materials, we present a class of two-phase composites with controllable interlocking. The composites feature tessellations of stiff particles connected by a soft matrix and we control the degree of interlocking through irregularity of particle size, geometry and arrangement. We generate the composites through stochastic network growth, using an algorithm which connects a hexagonal grid of nodes according to a coordination number, defined as the average number of connections per node. The generated network forms the soft matrix phase of the composites, while the areas enclosed by the network form the stiff reinforcing particles. At low coordination, composites feature highly polydisperse particles with irregular geometries, which are arranged non-periodically. In response to loading, these particles interlock with each other and primarily rotate and deform to accommodate non-uniform kinematic constraints from adjacent particles. In contrast, higher coordination composites feature more monodisperse particles with uniform geometries, which collectively slide. We then show how to control the degree of interlocking as a function of coordination number alone, demonstrating how irregularity facilitates controllability.</description>

      <title>From Champagne to Confined Polymer:Natural and Artifical Bubble Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel experimental work on bubble nucleation and growth using a model system comprised by viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral (PVB) confined in a Hele-Shaw cell geometry that is decompressed at elevated temperatures. The driver is connected to the temperature-induced shift in chemical equilibrium experienced simultaneously by two gases present in the bulk. The latter becomes at the same time oversaturated with water vapor and slightly undersaturated in air. Our bubbles grow with various shapes and sizes depending on the initial morphology of the nucleus or the presence of neighboring bubbles. The likelihood of nucleation is related to the amount of water dissolved in the bulk and the imposed temperature. Counter-intuitively, the number of nuclei whence a bubble can grow is inversely correlated with said temperature. In an analogy with Champagne, we show that nucleation can either be natural, at trapped fibers or dust particles, or artificial, at crenels we purposefully made in the glass surface. Our results indicate that the growth rate of bubbles can be impacted by the nucleation mechanism.</description>

      <title>The $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: II. Balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is the second of a three-part series that derives a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of arbitrarily curved lipid membranes. Existing continuum theories commonly treat lipid membranes as strictly two-dimensional surfaces. While this approach is successful in many purely mechanical applications, strict surface theories fail to capture the electric potential drop across lipid membranes, the effects of surface charges, and electric fields within the membrane. Consequently, they do not accurately resolve Maxwell stresses in the interior of the membrane and its proximity. Furthermore, surface theories are generally unable to capture the effects of distinct velocities and tractions at the interfaces between lipid membranes and their surrounding bulk fluids. To address these shortcomings, we apply a recently proposed dimension reduction method to the three-dimensional, electromechanical balance laws. This approach allows us to derive an effective surface theory without taking the limit of vanishing thickness, thus incorporating effects arising from the finite thickness of lipid membranes. We refer to this effective surface theory as $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the thickness. The resulting $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional equations of motion satisfy velocity and traction continuity conditions at the membrane-bulk interfaces, capture the effects of Maxwell stresses, and can directly incorporate three-dimensional constitutive models.</description>

      <title>The $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes: III. Constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the continuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly modeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when considering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for their thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure in part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the thickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce Gauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting theory as $(2+\delta)$-dimensional, where $\delta$ indicates the membrane thickness. However, the $(2+\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2 are general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to lipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional constitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic behavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a three-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses as strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is recovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this gives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it differs in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans theory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid membranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface incompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use the constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion describing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>The Rouse ring chain with attractive harmonic potential of spherical symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature is studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e. the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a pseudo-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared segmental displacement.</description>

      <title>Particle geometry space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of these geometry parameters has often been examined in isolation, e.g., through separate analysis of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also encompasses attributes such as surface area and volume (or collectively, the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is also referred to as specific surface). To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, Particle Geometry Space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the four 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, size, and shape - can be uniformly represented as a function of specific surface. This space not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</description>

      <title>General theory for packing icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>
