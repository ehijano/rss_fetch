      <title>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T&lt;T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i&lt;0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*&gt;0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.</description>

      <title>Avalanche activity noises in sandpile models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) and the Manna sandpile models of self-organized criticality. In the models, previous studies revealed a signature of long-range temporal correlations in the avalanche activity. We examine the power spectra of the noises with different system sizes and find that the power spectrum for a finite-size system exhibits three distinct frequency regimes: (i) a frequency-independent behavior below a lower cutoff frequency, (ii) a hump-type behavior in the intermediate-frequency regime, and (iii) a power-law scaling $1/f^{\alpha}$ in the high-frequency regime. The power scales with the system size in all regimes, but with different exponents. Also, the lower cutoff and peak frequencies decay in a power-law manner with the system size. We apply finite-size scaling and obtain data collapse for the power spectra, corroborating the estimation of the scaling exponents. Our studies reveal subtle scaling features for the temporal correlation within the avalanches.</description>

      <title>Learning Kinetic Monte Carlo stochastic dynamics with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and future perspectives are critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Free-fermion approach to the partition function zeros : Special boundary conditions and product form of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partition function zeros are powerful tools in understanding critical behavior. In this paper we present new results of the Fisher zeros of two-dimensional Ising models, in the framework of free-fermion eight-vertex model. First we succeed in finding special boundary conditions for the free-fermion model, under which the partition function of a finite lattice can be expressed in a double product form. Using appropriate mappings, these boundary conditions are transformed into the corresponding versions of the square, triangular and honeycomb lattice Ising models. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. For the square lattice model we rediscover the famous Brascamp-Kunz (B-K) boundary conditions. For the triangular and honeycomb lattice models we obtain the B-K type boundary conditions, and the Fisher zeros are conveniently solved from the product form of partition function. The advantage of B-K type boundary conditions is that the Fisher zeros of any finite lattice exactly lie on certain loci, and the accumulation points of zeros can be easily determined in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding and method would be very helpful in studying the partition function zeros of vertex and Ising models.</description>

      <title>Multiscale complexity of two-dimensional Ising systems with short-range, ferromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains challenging, particularly in systems beyond canonical examples, due to the absence of a generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The multiscale complexity formalism aims to address this challenge by employing information-theoretic indices of structure to identify the scales at which collective behaviors emerge. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity profile index as a tool for identifying such scales by applying it to two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising systems. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit multiscale behavior in the critical region, and the emergence of macroscopic magnetization in the ordered phase corresponds to a non-monotonic behavior of the complexity profile at large scales. Additionally, we show that the pairwise complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.</description>

      <title>Weak decaying collective-excitation approximation for Yukawa one-component plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the theoretical model of weak decaying collective excitations characteristic of many-particle systems with long-range interaction potentials is developed using the example of one-component strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas. The proposed model is based on the self-consistent relaxation theory of collective dynamics and covers spatial scales from extended hydrodynamics to scales related to the mean interparticle distance. The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.</description>

      <title>What exactly is 'active matter'?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the study of active matter has developed into one of the most rapidly growing subfields of condensed matter physics, more and more kinds of physical systems have been included in this framework. While the word 'active' is often thought of as referring to self-propelled particles, it is also applied to a large variety of other systems such as non-polar active nematics or certain particles with non-reciprocal interactions. Developing novel forms of active matter, as attempted, e.g., in the framework of quantum active matter, requires a clear idea of what active matter is. Here, we critically discuss how the understanding of active matter has changed over time, what precisely a definition of 'active matter' can look like, and to what extent it is (still) possible to define active matter in a way that covers all systems that are commonly understood as active matter while distinguishing them from other driven systems. Moreover, we discuss the definition of an 'active field theory', where 'active' is used as an attribute of a theoretical model rather than of a physical system. We show that the usage of the term 'active' requires agreement on a coarse-grained viewpoint. We discuss the meaning of 'active' both in general terms and via the specific examples of chemically driven particles, ultrasound-driven particles, active nematics, particles with non-reciprocal interactions, intracellular phase separation, and quantum active matter.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</description>

      <title>Following the Committor Flow: A Data-Driven Discovery of Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms and, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a challenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path ensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most informative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition pathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic insight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor and, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting from an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from which we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From this learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized strings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance sampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths until convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide conformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Kuramoto Oscillator Network for Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Random Lozenge Waterfall: Dimensional Collapse of Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the q-Racah probability measure on lozenge tilings of a hexagon whose side lengths scale linearly with a large parameter $L$, while the parameters $q\in(0,1)$ and $\kappa\in \mathbf{i}\mathbb{R}$ remain fixed. This regime differs fundamentally from the traditional case $q\sim e^{-c/L}\to1$, in which random tilings are locally governed by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In the fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall (previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs structure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we call a barcode.
  We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration, showing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile. We further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional barcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under shifts by $2\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent period-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The kernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}+\frac12)$, that may be of independent interest.
  Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of Borodin-Gorin-Rains (https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting asymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to non-self-adjoint operators. We overcome these challenges in the exponential concentration result by a separate argument based on sharp bounds for the ratios of probabilities under the q-Racah orthogonal polynomial ensemble.</description>

      <title>Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) are often employed. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. While previous studies have applied NBMF primarily to dense data such as images, this paper proposes a modified NBMF algorithm tailored for collaborative filtering with sparse data. In the modified method, unrated entries in the rating matrix are masked, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha &lt; 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha &gt; 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</description>

      <title>Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in stochastic thermodynamics, a universal and rigorous ensemble framework for nonequilibrium steady states remains lacking. Here, we provide a concise framework for generalized ensemble theory through a matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, we show that any discrete probability distribution can be formulated as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and their conjugate variables serving as basis vectors and coordinates in a vector space. Within this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required to infer the Boltzmann distribution. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations and fluctuation-dissipation relations naturally emerge from this framework. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady-state systems.</description>

      <title>It's about time: a thermodynamic information criterion (TIC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Useful chemical processes often involve a desired steady state probability distribution, equilibrium or not, from which product is extracted. Given many different ways to attain the same steady state, which candidate "loses" the least in terms of time and energy? A scalar thermodynamic information criterion (TIC), inspired by AIC, assigns lower values to chemical processes with less estimated "loss" to generate the same desired steady state. As an element of thermodynamic machine learning, TIC naturally extends statistical objective optimization into the realm of chemical physics.</description>

      <title>A minimal model with stochastically broken reciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model consisting of a two-body system with stochastically broken reciprocity (i.e., random violation of Newton's third law) and then investigate its statistical behaviors, including fluctuations of velocity and position, time evolution of probability distribution functions, energy gain, and entropy production. The effective temperature of this two-body system immersed in a thermal bath is also derived. Furthermore, we heuristically present an extremely minimal model where the relative motion adheres to the same rules as in classical mechanics, while the effect of stochastically broken reciprocity only manifests in the fluctuating motion of the center of mass.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory and the absorption of Brownian particles by partially reactive targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the case of partially absorbing targets ($0&lt;\kappa&lt;\infty$), the covariance matrix for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain $\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Observable Statistical Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the stationary behavior of observables in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum statistical mechanics. While one can often use the Gibbs ensemble, which is simple to compute, there are many scenarios where this is not possible and one must instead use another ensemble, such as the diagonal, microcanonical or generalized Gibbs ensembles. However, these all require detailed information about the energy or other conserved quantities to be constructed. Here we propose a general and computationally easy approach to determine the stationary probability distribution of observables with few outcomes. Interpreting coarse measurements at equilibrium as noisy communication channels, we provide general analytical arguments in favor of the applicability of a maximum entropy principle for this class of observables. We show that the resulting theory accurately predicts stationary probability distributions without detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 non-weakly interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework in both quantum integrable and chaotic models.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>
