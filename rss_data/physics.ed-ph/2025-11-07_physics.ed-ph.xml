      <title>Examining Student and AI Generated Personalized Analogies in Introductory Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing abstract concepts (such as electric circuits) with familiar ideas (plumbing systems) through analogies is central to practice and communication of physics. Contemporary research highlights self-generated analogies to better facilitate students' learning than the taught ones. "Spontaneous" and "self-generated" analogies represent the two ways through which students construct personalized analogies. However, facilitating them, particularly in large enrollment courses remains a challenge, and recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) promise potential to address this issue. In this qualitative study, we analyze around 800 student responses in exploring the extent to which students spontaneously leverage analogies while explaining Morse potential curve in a language suitable for second graders and self-generate analogies in their preferred everyday contexts. We also compare the student-generated spontaneous analogies with AI-generated ones prompted by students. Lastly, we explore the themes associated with students' perceived ease and difficulty in generating analogies across both cases. Results highlight that unlike AI responses, student-generated spontaneous explanations seldom employ analogies. However, when explicitly asked to explain the behavior of the curve in terms of their everyday contexts, students employ diverse analogical contexts. A combination of disciplinary knowledge, agency to generate customized explanations, and personal attributes tend to influence students' perceived ease in generating explanations across the two cases. Implications of these results on the potential of AI to facilitate students' personalized analogical reasoning, and the role of analogies in making students notice gaps in their understanding are discussed.</description>

      <title>A quaternionic approach to teaching 3D rotations and the resolution of gimbal lock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternions provide a unified algebraic and geometric framework for representing three-dimensional rotations without the singularities that afflict Euler-angle parametrisations. This article develops a pedagogical and conceptual analysis of the \emph{Gimbal lock} phenomenon and demonstrates, step by step, how quaternion algebra resolves it. Beginning with the limitations of Euler representations, the work introduces the quaternionic rotation operator $v' = q\,v\,q^{*}$, derives the Rodrigues formula, and establishes the continuous, singularity-free mapping between unit quaternions and the rotation group $SO(3)$. The approach combines historical motivation, formal derivation, and illustrative examples designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. As an extension, Appendix~A presents the geometric and topological interpretations of quaternions, including their relation to the groups $\mathbb{Q}_8$ and $SU(2)$, and the Dirac belt trick, offering a visual analogy that reinforces the connection between algebra and spatial rotation. Overall, this work highlights the educational value of quaternions as a coherent and elegant framework for understanding rotational dynamics in physics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Skills for Non-PhD Roles in the Quantum Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) workforce grows, there is an anticipated need for professionals with bachelor's and master's degrees who can fill a wide range of roles in the quantum industry. This report identifies the experimental skills needed for individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees to succeed in quantum industry roles. Through semi-structured interviews with quantum industry employers, we gathered data on 22 distinct positions spanning hardware, software, and business functions. While employers describe varying expectations of quantum expertise, the unifying requirement across these roles is proficiency in experimental skills, which fall into four key categories: instrumentation, computation and data analysis, experimental and project design, as well as communication and collaboration. Positions open to bachelor's and master's graduates use all four skill areas, but the balance of experimental skill set needed differs. Bachelor's roles lean toward instrumentation, computation and data analysis, as well as experimental and project design skills. Individuals in these roles build, operate, and troubleshoot hardware, and they gather and interpret data to design and carry out experiments. Master's roles stand out with the communication and collaboration skills needed on top of the other three skill categories. Individuals in these roles oversee experiments, coordinate teams, and align efforts with company and client needs. By articulating experimental skills needed for bachelor's and master's roles in the quantum industry, this report provides actionable insights for educators developing QISE courses and programs.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spectroscopy Using Diffraction Grating, CMOS Monochrome Sensor, and Reflecting Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a compact, low-cost stellar spectrometer developed for undergraduate and outreach applications. The instrument employs a 600 lines/mm diffraction grating, a CMOS monochrome sensor, and a 3D-printed mount integrated with reflecting telescopes. Calibration was performed using helium emission sources in the laboratory and Vega as a spectrophotometric standard, supported by a custom Python-based image-processing pipeline for wavelength calibration and spectral stacking. The spectrometer successfully recorded usable spectra of bright stars including Vega, Sirius, Procyon, Capella, and Betelgeuse, covering spectral types A through M. The results demonstrate that meaningful stellar spectroscopy can be achieved with accessible, low-cost equipment, providing a practical framework for student-led astronomical instrumentation projects.</description>
