      <title>Refining Boundary Value Problems in Non-local Micropolar Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores refined boundary conditions for a traction-free surface in a non-local micropolar half-space, combining non-local and micropolar elasticity effects to study Rayleigh wave propagation in an isotropic, homogeneous medium. This study revisits the solution for Rayleigh waves obtained within the framework of Eringen's non-local differential model. It highlights that the equivalence between the non-local differential and integral formulations breaks down for a micropolar half-space and can only be restored under specific additional boundary conditions. For mathematical tractability, equivalence is assumed for a defined subset of stresses. Asymptotic analysis is further employed to capture the effects of the boundary layer within the non-local micropolar half-space. This technique finally derives the refined boundary conditions for micropolar media.</description>

      <title>Factorization of rational six vertex model partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show factorization formulas for a class of partition functions of rational six vertex model. First we show factorization formulas for partition functions under triangular boundary. Further, by combining the factorization formulas with the explicit forms of the generalized domain wall boundary partition functions by Belliard-Pimenta-Slavnov, we derive factorization formulas for partition functions under trapezoid boundary which can be viewed as a generalization of triangular boundary. We also discuss an application to emptiness formation probabilities under trapezoid boundary which admit determinant representations.</description>

      <title>Discrete time scattering and Wold's decomposition in pictures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on explicit computations, various concepts of discrete time scattering theory are reviewed, discussed, and illustrated. The dynamics are taking place on a discrete half-space. All operators are represented graphically. The expressions obtained for the wave operators lead to an easily visualized interpretation of Wold's decomposition, a seminal result of operator theory. This work is clearly pedagogically oriented with the aim of providing explicit formulas and pictures for usually unexplicit operators.</description>

      <title>The Haar measure in solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the overlooked but crucial role of the Haar measure in solid mechanics, a concept well-established in mathematical literature but frequently misunderstood by mechanicians. The aim is to provide practical insights and methodologies for the application of the Haar measure in various mechanical scenarios. The article begins with an introduction to the Haar measure, underlying its significance and a theoretical foundation for its definition and formulas. Moving beyond mathematical abstraction, the core of the article relies on practical applications, including the computation of the Haar measure for the orthogonal transformations of the 2D and 3D space under several commonly used parametrisations, an application about invariant theory in mechanics and sampling on a group orbit. These applications are presented with practical examples, enabling mechanicians to integrate the Haar measure into their research seamlessly. The article caters to a broad audience, with sections designed for both introductory comprehension and in-depth exploration. Our goal is to equip mechanicians with a valuable tool, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and practical applications in the field of mechanics.</description>

      <title>3d Mirror Symmetry is Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3d mirror symmetry is a mysterious duality for certian pairs of hyperk\"ahler manifolds, or more generally complex symplectic manifolds/stacks. In this paper, we will describe its relationships with 2d mirror symmetry. This could be regarded as a 3d analog of the paper "Mirror Symmetry is T-Duality" by Strominger, Yau and Zaslow which described 2d mirror symmetry via 1d dualities.</description>

      <title>Do causal sets have symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal sets are locally finite, partially ordered sets (posets), which are considered as discrete models of spacetimes. On the one hand, causal sets corresponding to a spacetime manifold are commonly generated with a random process called sprinkling. This process keeps only a discrete set of points of the manifold and their causal relations (loosing the spacetime symmetries in each sprinkle). On the other hand, the main conjecture of causal set theory is that given an ensemble of causal sets there is a corresponding spacetime manifold and the continuum symmetries of it are like all manifold properties "reconstructable" from the partial orders of all the causal sets in the ensemble. But most generic finite posets have very few layers ("instances of time") in contrast to sprinkles with many layers in a sufficiently large spacetime region.
  In a recent project, I investigated the automorphism groups of (finite) posets in order to identify and classify their symmetries systematically. The comparison of local symmetries of generic posets (including Kleitmann-Rothschild orders) with sprinkled causal sets may help us to find those posets that can serve as discrete spacetime models in causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Variational Principles for Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in Hamiltonian variational principles, Hamiltonian variational integrators, and their applications such as to optimization and control, we present a new Type II variational approach for Hamiltonian systems, based on a virtual work principle that enforces the Type II boundary conditions through a combination of essential and natural boundary conditions; particularly, this approach allows us to define this variational principle intrinsically on manifolds. We first develop this variational principle on vector spaces and subsequently extend it to parallelizable manifolds, general manifolds, as well as to the infinite-dimensional setting. Furthermore, we provide a review of variational principles for Hamiltonian systems in various settings as well as their applications.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable quantum spin-glass model with 1RSB-fullRSB transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum spin-glass model, a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a transverse mean-field type random magnet. We rigorously derive the exact expression of the free energy of this model at the entire parameter region. The obtained exact solution implies the existence of a 1RSB-fullRSB transition at low temperatures. Our technique can be applied to general classical spin models, telling that any solvable classical spin model has its solvable quantum counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quasi-triangular, factorizable Leibniz bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of quasi-triangular Leibniz bialgebras, which can be constructed from solutions of the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation (CLYBE) whose skew-symmetric parts are invariant. In addition to triangular Leibniz bialgebras, quasi-triangular Leibniz bialgebras contain factorizable Leibniz bialgebras as another subclass, which lead to a factorization of the underlying Leibniz algebras. Relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights on Leibniz algebras are used to characterize solutions of the CLYBE whose skew-symmetric parts are invariant. On skew-symmetric quadratic Leibniz algebras, such operators correspond to Rota-Baxter type operators. Consequently, we introduce the notion of skew-symmetric quadratic Rota-Baxter Leibniz algebras, such that they give rise to triangular Leibniz bialgebras in the case of weight $0$, while they are in one-to-one correspondence with factorizable Leibniz bialgebras in the case of nonzero weights.</description>

      <title>CMM formula as superintegrability property of unitary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical example of superintegrability is provided by expression of the Hopf link hyperpolynomial in an arbitrary representation through a pair of the Macdonald polynomials at special points. In the simpler case of the Hopf link HOMFLY-PT polynomial and a pair of the Schur functions, it is a relation in the unitary matrix model. We explain that the Cherednik-Mehta-Macdonald (CMM) identity for bilinear Macdonald residues with an elliptic weight function is nothing but a reformulation of these same formulas. Their lifting to arbitrary knots and links, even torus ones remains obscure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expected transition frequency between the two metastable states of a stochastic wave equation with double-well potential. By transition state theory, the frequency factorizes into two components: one depends only on the invariant measure, given by the $\phi^4_d$ quantum field theory, and the other takes the dynamics into account. We compute the first component with the variational approach to stochastic quantization when $d = 2, 3$. For the two-dimensional equation with random data but no stochastic forcing, we also compute the transmission coefficient.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology rings for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range $|a|&lt;M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence, boundedness and decay for small data solutions $\psi$ to a general class of quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black hole backgrounds in the full sub-extremal range $|a|&lt;M$. The method extends our previous [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of background spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very slowly rotating regime $|a|\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|&lt;M$ case, our present proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous estimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in order to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the existence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate coercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of wave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients can be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22], exploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency decomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16], is defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to separate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to localise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the other hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our wave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors provided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error terms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.</description>

Abstract: We prove global existence and decay for small-data solutions to a class of quasilinear wave equations on a wide variety of asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of a "blackbox" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation. In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases (we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$, which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave operator of time-dependent metrics.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for initial data sets satisfying the dominant energy condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>A unified-description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Commutative families in DIM algebra, integrable many-body systems and $q,t$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our consideration of commutative subalgebras (rays) in different representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra to the elliptic Hall algebra (or, equivalently, to the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra $U_{q,t}(\widehat{\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$). Its advantage is that it possesses the Miki automorphism, which makes all commutative rays equivalent. Integrable systems associated with these rays become finite-difference and, apart from the trigonometric Ruijsenaars system not too much familiar. We concentrate on the simplest many-body and Fock representations, and derive explicit formulas for all generators of the elliptic Hall algebra $e_{n,m}$. In the one-body representation, they differ just by normalization from $z^nq^{m\hat D}$ of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Lie algebra, and, in the $N$-body case, they are non-trivially generalized to monomials of the Cherednik operators with action restricted to symmetric polynomials. In the Fock representation, the resulting operators are expressed through auxiliary polynomials of $n$ variables, which define weights in the residues formulas. We also discuss $q,t$-deformation of matrix models associated with constructed commutative subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of the HOMFLY polynomial for bipartite knots and links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of twisted Laplacians and random matrix theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rudnick recently proved that the spectral number variance for the Laplacian of a large compact hyperbolic surface converges, in a certain scaling limit and when averaged with respect to the Weil-Petersson measure on moduli space, to the number variance of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory. In this article we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal symmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This addresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted Laplacians on high degree random covers of a fixed compact surface.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Spacetime constructed from a contact manifold with a degenerate metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Our proofs are largely based on majorization theory and convex optimization. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk (SAW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq5$ and use it to prove pattern theorems for the self-avoiding walk. We show that infinite two-sided SAW is the infinite-shift limit of infinite one-sided SAW and the infinite-size limit of finite two-sided SAW. We then prove that for every pattern $\zeta$, the fraction of times $\zeta$ occurs in the SAW converges to the probability that the two-sided infinite SAW starts with $\zeta$. The convergence is in probability for the finite SAW and almost surely for the infinite SAW. Along the way, we show that infinite SAW is ergodic using a coupling technique. At the end of the paper, we pose a conjecture regarding the existence of infinite SAW in low dimensions. We show that this conjecture is true in high dimensions, thus giving a new proof for the existence of infinite SAW for $d\geq5$. The proofs in this paper rely only on the asymptotics for the number of self-avoiding paths and the SAW two-point function. Although these results were shown by Hara and Slade using the lace expansion, the proofs in this paper do not use the lace expansion and might be adapted to prove existence and ergodicity of other infinite high-dimensional lattice models.</description>
