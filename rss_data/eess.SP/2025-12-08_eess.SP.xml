      <title>GNSS Jammer Direction Finding in Dynamic Scenarios Using an Inertial-based Multi-Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective countermeasures. In this paper, we utilize a two-times-two patch antenna system (i.e., the software defined radio device Ettus USRP X440) to predict the angle, elevation, and distance to the jamming source based on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples. We propose to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the antenna system to predict the relative movement of the antenna in dynamic scenarios. We present a synthetic aperture system that enables coherent spatial imaging using platform motion to synthesize larger virtual apertures, offering superior angular resolution without mechanically rotating antennas. While classical angle-of-arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors, we utilize a methodology that fuses IQ and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms with 22 AoA features and the predicted relative movement to enhance GNSS jammer direction finding.</description>

      <title>Elevation- and Tilt-Aware Shadow Fading Correlation Modeling for UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks demand a more accurate understanding of channel behavior to enable efficient communication with reduced interference. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play an integral role in these networks, offering versatile applications and flexible deployment options. However, accurately characterizing the shadow fading (SF) behavior in UAV communications remains a challenge. Traditional SF correlation models rely on spatial distance and neglect the UAV's 3D orientation and elevation angle. Yet even slight variations in pitch angle (5 to 10 degrees) can significantly affect the signal strength observed by a UAV. In this study, we investigate the impact of UAV pitch and elevation geometry on SF and propose an elevation- and tilt-aware spatial correlation model. We use a real-world fixed-altitude UAV measurement dataset collected in a rural environment at 3.32 GHz with a 125 kHz bandwidth. Results show that a 10-degree tilt-angle separation and a 20-degree elevation-angle separation can reduce the SF correlation by up to 15% and 40%, respectively. In addition, integrating the proposed correlation model into the ordinary Kriging (OK) framework for signal strength prediction yields an approximate 1.5 dB improvement in median RMSE relative to the traditional correlation model that ignores UAV orientation and elevation.</description>

      <title>Noise Suppression for Time Difference of Arrival: Performance Evaluation of a Generalized Cross-Correlation Method Using Mean Signal and Inverse Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method, termed GCC-MSIF, to improve time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation accuracy in noisy environments. Conventional GCC methods often suffer from performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, particularly when the signal bandwidth is unknown. GCC-MSIF introduces a "mean signal" estimated from multi-channel inputs and an "inverse filter" to virtually reconstruct the source signal, enabling adaptive suppression of out-of-band noise. Numerical simulations simulating a small-scale array demonstrate that GCC-MSIF significantly outperforms conventional methods, such as GCC-PHAT and GCC-SCOT, in low SNR regions and achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding the maximum likelihood (GCC-ML) method. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy improves scalably with the number of array elements. These results suggest that GCC-MSIF is a promising solution for robust passive localization in practical blind environments.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Impaired Over-the-Air Computation with Fluid Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) array-enhanced over-the-air computation (AirComp) system in the presence of hardware impairments (HWIs), exploiting the new degrees of freedom offered by reconfigurable antenna positioning. To minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregated signal, we jointly optimize transmit power control, receive beamforming, and the antenna position vector (APV), subject to practical constraints such as HWI-induced distortion noise, FA movement energy consumption, and total power budgets. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and highly coupled. To address it efficiently, we adopt a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework, decomposing it into three manageable subproblems. For each subproblem, closed-form solutions or efficient numerical algorithms are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint transceiver and APV design significantly reduces the MSE compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and exhibits enhanced robustness against hardware impairments. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm are further validated under various system configurations.</description>

      <title>Individual Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RIS) has emerged as a promising evolution of RIS technology. By enabling interconnections between RIS elements, BD-RIS architectures offer greater flexibility in wave manipulation compared to traditional diagonal RIS designs. However, these interconnections introduce new research challenges for channel estimation, making existing approaches developed for conventional diagonal RISs ineffective and significantly increasing pilot overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individual channel estimation framework that separately estimates the BS-RIS channel, which typically remains static over time, and the RIS-user channels, which vary rapidly due to user mobility. Specifically, we develop a full-duplex (FD) approach to estimate the BS-RIS channel by leveraging its inherent sparsity. Following this, the RIS-user channels are estimated using a least squares (LS) approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher channel estimation accuracy, particularly when the number of RIS elements is large, while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional cascaded channel estimation methods.</description>

      <title>A Non-Invasive Path to Animal Welfare: Contactless Vital Signs and Activity Monitoring of In-Vivo Rodents Using a mm-Wave FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring physiological and behavioral parameters of laboratory rodents is fundamental for biomedical research, yet conventional techniques often rely on invasive sensors or frequent handling that can induce stress and compromise data fidelity. To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages. The proposed approach lays the foundation for scalable, automated, and ethical monitoring solutions in preclinical and translational research.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Semantic Alignment with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication systems aim to transmit task-relevant information between devices capable of artificial intelligence, but their performance can degrade when heterogeneous transmitter-receiver models produce misaligned latent representations. Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Multiplexing Based on Pixel Antennas: An Antenna Coding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antenna coding approach for exploiting the spatial multiplexing capability of pixel antennas is proposed. This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Codebook-based Port Selection and Combining for CSI-Free Uplink Fluid Antenna Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) has recently emerged as a simple, promising scheme for large-scale multiuser connectivity, offering strong scalability with low implementation complexity. Nevertheless, most existing FAMA studies focus on downlink transmission under perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side, while the uplink counterpart remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel codebook-based port selection and combining (CPSC) FAMA framework for the uplink communications without CSI at the base station (BS). In the proposed scheme, a predefined codebook is designed and broadcast by the BS. Each user equipment (UE) employs a fluid antenna, acquires its local CSI and independently chooses the most suitable codeword, activates the corresponding fluid antenna ports, and determines the combining weights to achieve a two-way match between the selected codeword and the instantaneous effective channel. The BS then separates the superimposed user signals through codebook-guided projection operations without requiring global CSI or multiuser joint optimization. To handle potential codeword collisions, three lightweight scheduling strategies are introduced, offering flexible trade-offs between signaling overhead and collision avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CPSC-FAMA approach achieves substantially higher rates than fixed-antenna systems while maintaining low complexity. Moreover, the results confirm that amortizing the optimization cost over the UEs effectively reduces the BS processing burden and enhances scalability, making the proposed scheme a strong candidate for future sixth-generation (6G) networks.</description>

      <title>Radar Network Waveform Design for Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the synthesis of slow-time coded waveforms for single target tracking in a radar network operating under colored Gaussian interference. Based on the Posterior Cram\'er Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB), which characterizes the theoretically optimal accuracy of target state estimation, the problem at each tracking frame is formulated as the minimization of the trace of the PCRLB, together with power budget requirements and a similarity constraint to account for transmitter limitations and appropriate waveform features. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, an approximation solution technique is proposed, aimed at better tracking accuracy than the reference code. The resulting approximated problems, endowed with more tractable objective functions through Taylor-series expansion, are solved using a customized block Majorization-Minimization (block-MM) algorithm. The convergence properties of the developed procedure are thoroughly analyzed. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy improvements in the target state estimation process, and robust tracking performance under uncertain target state conditions achieved by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>A Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares Filter for Real-time UAV Terrain Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate real-time waypoints estimation for the UAV-based online Terrain Following during wildfire patrol missions is critical to ensuring flight safety and enabling wildfire detection. However, existing real-time filtering algorithms struggle to maintain accurate waypoints under measurement noise in nonlinear and time-varying systems, posing risks of flight instability and missed wildfire detections during UAV-based terrain following. To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings demonstrate both the methodological advances in real-time filtering and the practical potential of the RVM-RLS filter for UAV-based online wildfire patrol.</description>

      <title>SSDLabeler: Realistic semi-synthetic data generation for multi-label artifact classification in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG recordings are inherently contaminated by artifacts such as ocular, muscular, and environmental noise, which obscure neural activity and complicate preprocessing. Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.</description>

      <title>Decoding Selective Auditory Attention to Musical Elements in Ecologically Valid Music Listening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Art has long played a profound role in shaping human emotion, cognition, and behavior. While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings. This paves the way for applications in education, personalized music technologies, and therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>CryoDE: a Digital Cryogenic Detector Emulator for Microwave SQUID Multiplexed Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous readout of large-scale cryogenic detector arrays relies on multiplexing schemes such as the FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) with microwave SQUID multiplexers and highly customized readout electronics. In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distance based semi-supervised manifold learning and application to GNSS multi-path detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is to propose an optimal transport based semi-supervised approach to learn from scarce labelled image data using deep convolutional networks. The principle lies in implicit graph-based transductive semi-supervised learning where the similarity metric between image samples is the Wasserstein distance. This metric is used in the label propagation mechanism during learning. We apply and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a GNSS real life application. More specifically, we address the problem of multi-path interference detection. Experiments are conducted under various signal conditions. The results show that for specific choices of hyperparameters controlling the amount of semi-supervision and the level of sensitivity to the metric, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved over the fully supervised training method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Active Inference for Intelligent UAV Anti-Jamming and Adaptive Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning framework for UAVs operating under adversarial jamming conditions. Leveraging Bayesian Active Inference, the approach combines expert-generated demonstrations with probabilistic generative modeling to encode high-level symbolic planning, low-level motion policies, and wireless signal feedback. During deployment, the UAV performs online inference to anticipate interference, localize jammers, and adapt its trajectory accordingly, without prior knowledge of jammer locations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-expert performance, significantly reducing communication interference and mission cost compared to model-free reinforcement learning baselines, while maintaining robust generalization in dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Metasurface-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Unified Framework and Key Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.</description>

      <title>Radio over Fiber with Cascaded Structure: Algorithm for Uplink Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) radio-over-fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits, this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs) in cascade via fiber, envisioning its application in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power amplifiers (PAs) at the RUs and the propagation channel over the fiber. We propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate the propagation distance along the RoF and the time-of-arrival between the RoF and the user equipment. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even with the cascaded effects of non-linear PAs, and that the deployment of this RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Empowered Task Offloading in V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing plays an essential role in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks, where vehicles offload their intensive computation tasks to the road-side units for saving energy and reduce the latency. This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.</description>

      <title>OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal First-Arrival Modeling and Parameter Estimation in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form joint distribution of the first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in drift-diffusion molecular communication (MC) channels. In contrast to prior studies that analyze FAT or FAP in isolation, our framework explicitly captures the spatiotemporal coupling inherent in multidimensional transport. Building on this derivation, we compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and demonstrate that estimation accuracy for diffusivity scales proportionally with the spatial dimension, enabling increased sensitivity in higher-dimensional environments. Furthermore, we show that lateral drift -- which is unobservable from timing data alone -- can be recovered via a closed-form Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) with a simple physical interpretation. Leveraging this spatial degree of freedom, we propose Drift Shift Keying (DSK), proving that joint receivers can reliably detect signals that are undetectable to timing-only receivers due to identical marginal FAT distributions. These results highlight the significant potential of spatiotemporal processing for future nanoscale communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Deep Learning for Downhole Depth Sensing and Field Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network-based CCL signal recognition has achieved significant progress in collar identification, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into downhole tools for CCL signal acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. We propose comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation and evaluate their effectiveness using our neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across various configuration combinations, we analyze the contribution of each augmentation method. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing (LDS), and random cropping are fundamental requirements for model training, while label smoothing regularization (LSR), time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capability. The F1 scores of our two benchmark models trained with the proposed augmentation methods maximumly improve from 0.937 and 0.952 to 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. Performance validation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models in CCL data-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.</description>
