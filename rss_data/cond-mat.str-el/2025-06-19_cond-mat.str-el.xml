      <title>Non-degenerate Ground State of the Spin-Boson Model under Abelian Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra, we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG) methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of the system.</description>

      <title>Time-domain decoding of unconventional charge order mechanisms in nonmagnetic and magnetic kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In kagome lattice materials, quantum interplay between charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom gives rise to a remarkably rich set of emergent phenomena, ranging from unconventional charge order and superconductivity to topological magnetism. While the exact nature of these exotic orders is often challenging to comprehend in static experiments, time-resolved techniques can offer critical insights by disentangling coupled degrees of freedom on the time-axis. In this work, we demonstrate that the nature of charge orders in two representative kagome metals - nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6 and magnetic FeGe - which has been highly controversial in static studies, can be directly deciphered in the time-domain through their fundamentally distinct order parameter dynamics measured via time-resolved X-ray scattering at an X-ray free electron laser. In nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6, the dynamics are characterized by ultrafast melting and coherent amplitudon oscillations, typical of a phonon-coupled charge order. In stark contrast, magnetic FeGe exhibits resilient metastable charge order dynamics, hitherto unobserved in any other charge-ordered system - this unique time-domain behavior directly signifies an unconventional magnetism-interlocked charge order state realized in this kagome magnet. Our results not only provide a model case where unconventional nature of electronic order, hidden in equilibrium, is directly unraveled in the time-domain, but also pave the way for future out-of-equilibrium engineering of novel quantum orders in kagome lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of the ferromagnetic rare-earth diboride HoB$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth (RE) compounds have been of enormous interest in condensed matter physics as a platform for the exploration of interesting physical phenomena. Here, we report the successful single crystal growth of HoB$_{2}$, which exhibits a paramagnetic (PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at 15 K and another phase transition at 11 K, and the discovery of a highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of this FM diboride. Magnetization measurements suggest that the ferromagnetically ordered moments of Ho$^{3+}$ ions are oriented at a direction tilted by 50 degrees from the ab-plane at 2K, which rotate largely toward the ab-plane direction upon application of a magnetic field, but hardly toward the c-axis direction. Heat capacity and electrical resistivity measurements clearly demonstrate that the low-temperature phase transition at 11 K occurs even under high magnetic fields along the ab-plane direction, whereas it disappears immediately by magnetic fields along the c-axis direction. Moreover, the field-induced crossover phenomenon between FM and PM phases near 15 K is found to be more promoted when applying a magnetic field along the ab-plane direction. The resulting magnetic phase diagram reveals that in-plane magnetic anisotropy is predominant in the present system, which contradicts the previous report of a spin reorientation phenomenon toward the c-axis direction between 11 K and 15 K. Taken together, the present findings suggest the presence of strong competition between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropies in HoB$_{2}$, giving rise to the unique FM spin arrangement.</description>

      <title>Successive Phase Transitions in the Quasi-Kagome Lattice System URhSn Studied by Resonant X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive phase transitions in the quasi-kagome compound URhSn were investigated by resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) at the uranium $M_4$ edge. In the high-temperature phase between 16 K and 54 K, an additional RXS signal was detected superposed onto fundamental reflections in both $\pi$-$\sigma'$ and $\pi$-$\pi'$ polarization channels. Upon cooling below 16 K, reported as a ferromagnetic phase along $c$, substantial enhancements were observed again in the both polarization channels at the 300 reflection, demonstrating a simultaneous emergence of in-plane spin alongside the $c$-axis ferromagnetic components. The observed behavior can be interpreted by an antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) order of $O_{yz}$ or $O_{zx}$ characterized by a propagation vector $q = 0$ in the intermediate phase, which then coexists with a ferromagnetic component below 16 K. The resulting ground state structure breaks the mirror symmetry perpendicular to the kagome plane, identifying the formation of a unique AFQ order with either chirality or polarity in URhSn.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Intertwined magnetic phase driven exchange bias and its impact on the anomalous Hall effect in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the interplay between atomic scale inhomogeneity and competing magnetic phases and its effect on the anomalous Hall effect in the layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, a natural superlattice hosting coexisting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), DC and AC magnetization, and magneto-transport measurements, we reveal that intrinsic Mn Bi antisite defects induce strong interlayer exchange coupling, giving rise to a robust exchange bias observed in both magnetic and Hall responses. The exchange bias undergoes a transition from asymmetric to symmetric behavior between 2 K and 6 K, indicating a temperature driven dynamical reconfiguration of interfacial spin structures. The training effect analysis revealed a stronger contribution of frozen spins at 2 K compared to 6 K, with relaxation amplitude shift from -264 Oe to 306 Oe. This sign reversal indicates a field-induced change in interfacial coupling. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity and magnetization reveals complementary behavior, indicating the coexistence of two distinct spin states near the magnetic transition temperature. The phase fraction based resistivity model captures the distinct scattering mechanisms that govern electronic transport across different magnetic regimes. Our findings offer a direct link between microscopic disorder, interfacial magnetism and macroscopic topological phenomena in magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Theory of universal Planckian metal in t-J model: application for high-Tc cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mysterious quantum-critical Planckian bad metal phase with perfect T-linear resistivity persisting beyond the quasi-particle limit and universal T-linear scattering rate has been observed in various high-Tc cuprate superconductors. Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model, derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced two-dimensional ferromagnetism in van der Waals $\beta$-UTe$_3$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of local-moment magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors down to the single-layer limit has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and unleashed their potential for applications in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. The incorporation of strong electronic and magnetic correlations in 2D vdW metals remains a sought-after platform not only to enable control of emergent quantum phases, such as superconductivity, but also to achieve more theoretically tractable microscopic models of complex materials. To date, however, there is limited success in the discovery of such metallic vdW platforms, and $f$-electron monolayers remain out of reach. Here we demonstrate that the actinide $\beta$-UTe$_3$ can be exfoliated to the monolayer limit. A sizable electronic specific heat coefficient provides the hallmark of strong correlations. Remarkably, $\beta$-UTe$_3$ remains ferromagnetic in the half-unit-cell limit with an enhanced ordering temperature of 35 K, a factor of two larger than its bulk counterpart. Our work establishes $\beta$-UTe$_3$ as a novel materials platform for investigating and modeling correlated behavior in the monolayer limit and opens numerous avenues for quantum control with, e.g., strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Free real scalar CFT on fuzzy sphere: spectrum, algebra and wavefunction ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple model to realize the free real scalar CFT on the fuzzy sphere. The model is structurally similar to the original model that realizes the 3D Ising CFT on the fuzzy sphere. Owing to the shift symmetry of the free scalar, the free scalar CFT fixed point in our model can be accessed with only a single tuning parameter-the conformal coupling. We numerically demonstrate that our model correctly reproduces the operator spectrum, correlation functions, and, crucially, the harmonic oscillator algebra of the real scalar CFT. We also examine the fuzzy sphere algebra, a generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, and discuss its potential implications for defining quantum field theories on non-commutative geometries. Finally, we propose wavefunction ansatz for the ground states of both the free scalar and Ising CFTs, which exhibit remarkable agreement with the CFT ground state wavefunctions of the fuzzy sphere model. For instance, the wavefunction overlap between our Ising ansatz and the Ising CFT ground state exceeds $0.99$ for $N=28$ fermions, suggesting a promising direction for tackling the 3D Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $\mathcal{T}$ and some other symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $\mathcal{O}$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors arising from interplay with frustrated spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Cooper pair analogue of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya's anisotropic coupling for $d$-vectors in an inhomogeneous unconventional superconductor, which can arise when itinerant electrons couple to a local exchange field of frustrated spin moments. Using perturbative Green's function methods, we examine an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice with noncollinear spin texture that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries, leading to spin-triplet pairing correlations. The effective Josephson tunneling in the presence of such an exchange field leads to an anisotropic Josephson coupling between $d$-vectors, which prefers a spatially inhomogeneous pairing order. Furthermore, we discuss anomalous vortices arising from the spatially inhomogeneous $d$-vector in the absence of a magnetic field for nonunitary triplet pairing order. We also propose a Josephson diode effect in which the diode efficiency is proportional to the spin chirality of the local exchange field. Our results can help understand the experiments in superconducting proximitized Mn$_3$Ge and in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large degeneracy based on product eigenstates has been found in spin ladders, kagome-like lattices, and motif magnetism, connected to spin liquids, anyonic phases, and quantum scars. We unify these systems by a complete classification of product eigenstates of Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonians with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on general graphs in the form of Kirchhoff rules for spin supercurrent. By this, we construct spin systems with extensive degree of degeneracy linked to exotic condensates which could be studied in atomic gases and quantum spin lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order in a group-based cluster state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>Nonmagnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$: The competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic ground states in crystalline systems are significant for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite FeTe$_{2}$, characterized as a small-gap semiconductor, exhibits anomalous magnetic behaviors in low-temperature experiments. In this study, first-principles density functional theory calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy are employed to investigate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe$_{2}$. It is revealed that the competition between crystal field splitting and on-site Coulomb repulsion plays the key role in the formation of localized magnetic moments in FeTe$_{2}$. The ground state of FeTe$_{2}$ bulk is confirmed to be nonmagnetic, while the magnetic responses of FeTe$_{2}$ observed at low temperature are suggested to be related to the magnetic Fe atoms on the crystal surfaces. Our work proposes a straightforward competing mechanism for determining ground-state magnetism of various localized-moment crystalline systems.</description>

Abstract: This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving landscape of quantum algorithm software specifically tailored for condensed matter physics. It examines fundamental quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as applied to key condensed matter problems including strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum magnetism. This review details leading software development kits (SDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and Q\#, and profiles key academic, commercial, and governmental initiatives driving innovation in this domain. Furthermore, it assesses current challenges, including hardware limitations, algorithmic scalability, and error mitigation, and explores future trajectories, anticipating new algorithmic breakthroughs, software enhancements, and the impact of next-generation quantum hardware. The central theme emphasizes the critical role of a co-design approach, where algorithms, software, and hardware evolve in tandem, and highlights the necessity of standardized benchmarks to accelerate progress towards leveraging quantum computation for transformative discoveries in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Octupolar Weyl Superconductivity from Electron-electron Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity arising from electron-electron interaction can manifest exotic symmetry and topological properties. We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry problem based on the 3D cubic $O_h$ symmetry with both weak- and strong-coupling approaches. The dominant pairing symmetries belong to the two-dimensional $E_g$ representation at low and intermediate doping levels, and the complex mixing gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}+id_{x^2-y^2}$-type is energetically favored in the ground state. Cooper pairs with such a symmetry do not possess orbital angular momentum (OAM) moments, which is different from other time-reversal symmetry breaking pairings such as $p_x+ip_y$ (e.g $^3$He-A) and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ under the planar hexagonal symmetry. Instead, they develop the octupolar $O_{xyz}$ component of OAM, which results in 8 nodal points along the body diagonal directions exhibiting an alternating distribution of monopole charges $\pm 1$. This leads to an intriguing 3D Weyl topological SC, which accommodates nontrivial surface states of Majorana arcs. Our results appeal for material realizations and experimental tests in optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism: the case of magnetically-mediated quantum-critical pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity with strong correlation is one of the most attracted issues in condensed-matter physics, as seen in various unconventional superconductors. Here we show a new strongly correlated superconductor Li1-xNbO2 with rich characteristics such as two-dimensional, geometrically frustrated, and triangular NbO2 lattice and correlated flat-band-like electronic states. We revealed the electronic phase diagram by implementing Li-ion electrochemical cells with LiNbO2 epitaxial films. The Li-ion deintercalation increased the hole-doping level in NbO2 layer, along which a band insulator LiNbO2 underwent to a Fermi-liquid (FL) metal and superconductor associated with non-Fermi liquid (NFL) characters. The evolution of the NFL state coincided with the suppression of the Kondo-singlet formation near the superconducting dome, which linked superconductivity with quantum criticality. The obtained phase diagram involves general aspects of strongly correlated superconductors and bridges the gap between various systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>
