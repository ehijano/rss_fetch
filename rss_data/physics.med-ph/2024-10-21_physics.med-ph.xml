      <title>Comparison of hydroxyapatite and honeycomb micro-structure in bone tissue engineering using electrospun beads-on-string fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thick honeycomb-like electrospun scaffold with nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite (nHA) recently demonstrated its potential to promote proliferation and differentiation of a murine embryonic cell line (C3H10T1/2) to osteoblasts. In order to distinguish the respective effects of the structure and the composition on cell differentiation, beads-on-string fibers were used to manufacture thick honeycomb-like scaffolds without nHA. Mechanical and biological impacts of those beads-on string fibers were evaluated. Uniaxial tensile test showed that beads-on-string fibers decreased the Young Modulus and maximal stress but kept them appropriate for tissue engineering. C3H10T1/2 were seeded and cultured for 6 days on the scaffolds without any growth factors. Viability assays revealed the biocompatibility of the beads-on-string scaffolds, with adequate cells-materials interactions observed by confocal microscopy. Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed at day 6 in order to compare the early differentiation of cells to bone fate. The measure of stained area and intensity confirmed the beneficial effect of both honeycomb structure and nHA, independently. Finally, we showed that honeycomb-like electrospun scaffolds could be relevant candidates for promoting bone fate to cells in the absence of nHA. It offers an easier and faster manufacture process, in particular in bone-interface tissue engineering, permitting to avoid the dispersion of nHA and their interaction with the other cells.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound matrix imaging for transcranial in-vivo localization microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains impacted by wave-front distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to those fundamental issues. As an experimental proof-of-concept, an in-vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheeps. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to drastically enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and non-ionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.</description>

      <title>Performance of a GPU- and Time-Efficient Pseudo 3D Network for Magnetic Resonance Image Super-Resolution and Motion Artifact Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14259v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortening acquisition time and reducing motion artifacts are the most critical challenges in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</description>
