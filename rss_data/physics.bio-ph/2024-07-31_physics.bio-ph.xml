      <title>Substrate stiffness modulates bacterial adhesion and diversity of adherent phenotypes across growth stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-adhesion and stiffness of underlying substrates mediate geometry, mechanics and self-organization of bacterial colonies. Recent studies have qualitatively indicted that stiffness may impact bacterial attachment, yet the variation of cell-to-surface adhesion with substrate stiffness remains to be quantified. Here, by developing a cell-level Force Distance Spectroscopy (FDS) technique based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), we simultaneously quantify the cell-surface adhesion alongside stiffness of the underlying substrates to reveal stiffness-dependent adhesion in phototrophic bacterium Chromatium okenii. As stiffness of the soft substrate, modelled via low-melting-point (LMP) agarose pad, was varied between 20 kPa and 120 kPa by changing agarose concentrations, we observe a progressive increase of the mean adhesion force by over an order of magnitude, from 0.21 (+/-0.10) nN to 2.42 (+/-1.16) nN. In contrast, passive polystyrene (PS) microparticles of comparable dimensions showed no perceptible change in their surface adhesion. Furthermore, for Escherichia coli, the cell-surface adhesion varied between 0.29 (+/-0.17) nN to 0.39 (+/-0.20) nN, showing a weak dependence on the substrate stiffness, thus suggesting that the stiffness-modulated adhesion is a species-specific trait. Finally, by quantifying the adhesion of C. okenii populations across growth stages, we report an emergent co-existence of weak and strongly adherent sub-populations, demonstrating a diversification of adherent phenotypes over time. Taken together, these findings suggest that bacteria, depending on the species and their physiological stage, actively modulate cell-to-surface adhesion in response to substrate stiffness, and leverage it as a functional trait to modulate initial attachment and colonization on soft substrates during early stages of biofilm development.</description>

      <title>Constrained motion of self-propelling eccentric disks linked by a spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been supposed that the interplay of elasticity and activity plays a key role in triggering the non-equilibrium behaviors in biological systems. However, the experimental model system is missing to investigate the spatiotemporally dynamical phenomena. Here, a model system of an active chain, where active eccentric-disks are linked by a spring, is designed to study the interplay of activity, elasticity, and friction. Individual active chain exhibits longitudinal and transverse motion, however, it starts to self-rotate when pinning one end, and self-beats when clamping one end. Additionally, our eccentric-disk model can qualitatively reproduce such behaviors and explain the unusual self-rotation of the first disk around its geometric center. Further, the structure and dynamics of long chains were studied via simulations without steric interactions. It was found that hairpin conformation emerges in free motion, while in the constrained motions, the rotational and beating frequencies scale with the flexure number (the ratio of self-propelling force to bending rigidity), ~4/3. Scaling analysis suggests that it results from the balance between activity and energy dissipation. Our findings show that topological constraints play a vital role in non-equilibrium synergy behavior.</description>

      <title>Escape of an Active Ring from an Attractive Surface: Behaving Like a Self-Propelled Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Escape of active agents from metastable states are of great current interest in statistical and biological physics. In this study, we find that a flexible active Brownian ring escapes from a flat attractive surface though two distinct mechanisms: Kramers-like thermal activation at large rotational diffusion coefficients, but with an effective temperature, and the first-passage process at small rotational diffusion coefficients. The escape time depends explicitly on the shape of potential barrier at large activity and small rotational diffusion coefficient. Moreover, when the propulsion force was biased along its contour, escape becomes more difficult and is primarily caused by thermal noise. Our findings highlight that, despite its intricate configuration, the active ring can be taken as an self-propelled Brownian particle when studying its escape from a smooth surface.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <title>Nature of barriers determine first passage times in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intuition suggests that passage times across a region increases with the number of barriers along the path. Can this fail depending on the nature of the barrier? To probe this fundamental question, we exactly solve for the first passage time in general d-dimensions for diffusive transport through a spatially patterned array of obstacles - either entropic or energetic, depending on the nature of the obstacles. For energetic barriers, we show that first passage times vary non-monotonically with the number of barriers, while for entropic barriers it increases monotonically. This non-monotonicity for energetic barriers further reflects in the behaviour of effective diffusivity as well. We then design a simple experiment where a robotic bug navigates a heterogeneous environment through a spatially patterned array of obstacles to validate our predictions. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show that this non-monotonic behaviour for energetic barriers is general and extends to even super-diffusive transport.</description>

      <title>Light-induced phase separation with finite wavelength selection in photophobic micro-algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As for many motile micro-algae, the freshwater species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can detect light sources and adapt its motile behavior in response. Here, we show that suspensions of photophobic cells can be unstable to density fluctuations, as a consequence of shading interactions mediated by light absorption. In a circular illumination geometry this mechanism leads to the complete phase separation of the system into transient branching patterns, providing the first experimental evidence of finite wavelength selection in an active phase-separating system without birth and death processes. The finite wavelength selection, that can be captured in a simple drift-diffusion framework, is a consequence of a vision-based interaction length scale set by the illumination geometry and depends on global cell density, light intensity and medium viscosity. Finally we show that this active phase separation shields individual cells from the deleterious effects of high light intensity, demonstrating that phototaxis can efficiently contribute to photoprotection through collective behaviors on short timescales.</description>
