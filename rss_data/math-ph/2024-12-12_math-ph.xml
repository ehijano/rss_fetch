      <title>A First Look at Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are expanded notes for a short series of lectures, presented at the University of Luxembourg in 2017, giving an introduction to some of the ideas of supersymmetry and supergeometry. In particular, we start from some motivating facts in physics, pass to the theory of supermanifolds, then to spinors, ending up at super-Minkowski space-times. We examine some salient mathematical issues with understanding supersymmetry in a classical setting and make no attempt to discuss phenomenologically interesting models. Moreover, the presentation is "light" in the sense that nothing is carefully proved. The audience of the seminars ranged from Ph.D. students to more experienced postdocs in mathematics. The audience was assumed to have a working knowledge of differential geometry, elementary category theory, and basic ideas from classical &amp; quantum mechanics. No knowledge of supersymmetry and supergeometry is assumed.</description>

      <title>Principles for a Distinguished Global Vacuum: Entropy and the Vacuum State in Causal Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of real scalar field theory on causal sets, the intimate relation of the Sorkin-Johnston vacuum to entropic purity is elucidated. It is shown that taking a set of sensible principles, and the most natural assumption on the space of fields, leaves the Sorkin-Johnston state as the only candidate for the global vacuum of a quasifree theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Deformation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to Quantum Mechanics that we call Curved Quantum Mechanics. We introduce an infinite-dimensional K\"ahler manifold ${\cal M}$, that we call the state manifold, such that the cotangent space $T_z^*{\cal M}$ is a Hilbert space. In this approach, a state of a quantum system is described by a point in the cotangent bundle $T^*{\cal M}$, that is, by a point $z\in{\cal M}$ in the state manifold and a one-form $\psi\in T^*_z{\cal M}$. The quantum dynamics is described by an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system on the state manifold with a magnetic field $H$, which reduces to the Schr\"odinger equation for zero curvature and reduces to the equations of geodesics for zero magnetic field. The curvature of the state manifold is determined by gravity, that is, by the mass/energy of the system, so that for microscopic systems the manifold is flat and for macroscopic systems it is strongly curved, which prohibits Schr\"odinger cat type states. We solved the dynamical equations exactly for the complex projective space and the complex hyperbolic space and show that in the case of negative curvature there is a bifurcation at a critical value of the curvature. This means that for small mass all modes are in the quantum regime with the unitary periodic dynamics and for large mass there are classical modes, with not a periodic but rather an exponential time evolution leading to a collapse of the state vector.</description>

      <title>States and IR divergences in factorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several choices of states. In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state $\langle-\rangle_{\rm aug}$. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime $\langle-\rangle_{\rm cptf}$, or a state corresponding Schwartz boundary condition $\langle-\rangle_{\rm Sch}$. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear.
  In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorization algebras and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized pentagram maps via Q-nets and refactorization mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalizations of the pentagram maps related to $Q$-nets. A specific example is considered, and we find the map can be treated as a refactorization mapping in the Poisson-Lie group of pseudo-difference operators. This method was firstly proposed by Izosimov, and we generalize it to fit our needs. Using this description, we obtain the corresponding Lax form with a spectral parameter and invariant Poisson brackets. Finally, we consider the reduction to $B$-nets and the discrete BKP equation, offering a geometric explanation for the discrete-time Toda equation of BKP type proposed by Hirota.</description>

      <title>A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum stealths and regular Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Koopman Theory-Inspired Method for Learning Time Advancement Operators in Unstable Flame Front Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the evolution of complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging, especially for nonlinear, chaotic behaviors. This study introduces Koopman-inspired Fourier Neural Operators (kFNO) and Convolutional Neural Networks (kCNN) to learn solution advancement operators for flame front instabilities. By transforming data into a high-dimensional latent space, these models achieve more accurate multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods. Benchmarking across one- and two-dimensional flame front scenarios demonstrates the proposed approaches' superior performance in short-term accuracy and long-term statistical reproduction, offering a promising framework for modeling complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Gromov ground state in phase space engineering for fusion energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase space engineering by RF waves plays important roles in both thermal D-T fusion and non-thermal advanced fuel fusion. But not all phase space manipulation is allowed, certain fundamental limits exist. In addition to Liouville's theorem, which requires the manipulation to be volume-preserving, Gromov's non-squeezing theorem imposes another constraint. The Gardner ground state is defined as the ground state accessible by smooth volume-preserving maps. However, the extra Gromov constraint should produce a higher-energy ground state. An example of a Gardner ground state forbidden by Gromov's non-squeezing theorem is given. The challenge question is: What is the Gromov ground state, i.e., the lowest energy state accessible by smooth symplectic maps? This is a difficult problem. As a simplification, we conjecture that the linear Gromov ground state problem is solvable.</description>

      <title>Invariant Stability Conditions on Certain Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply results on inducing stability conditions to local Calabi-Yau threefolds and obtain applications to Donaldson-Thomas (DT) theory. A basic example is the total space of the canonical bundle of $Z=\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We use a result of Dell to construct stability conditions on the derived category of $X$ for which all stable objects can be explicitly described. We relate them to stability conditions on the resolved conifold $Y=\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)^{\oplus 2}$ in two ways: geometrically via the McKay correspondence, and algebraically via a quotienting operation on quivers with potential. These stability conditions were first discussed in the physics literature by Closset and del Zotto, and were constructed mathematically by Xiong by a different method. We obtain a complete description of the corresponding DT invariants, from which we can conclude that they define analytic wall-crossing structures in the sense of Kontsevich and Soibelman. In the last section we discuss several other examples of a similar flavour.</description>

      <title>Primitive asymptotics in $\phi^4$ vector theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A longstanding conjecture in $\phi^4_4$ theory is that primitive graphs dominate the beta function asymptotically at large loop order in the minimal-subtraction scheme. Here we investigate this issue by exploiting additional combinatorial structure coming from an extension to vectors with $O(N)$ symmetry. For the 0-dimensional case, we calculate the $N$-dependent generating function of primitive graphs and its asymptotics, including arbitrarily many subleading corrections. We find that the leading asymptotic growth rate becomes visible only above $\approx 25$ loops, while data at lower order is suggestive of a wrong asymptotics. Our results also yield the exact asymptotics of Martin invariants.
  In 4D, each graph comes with a nontrivial Feynman integral, its period. We give bounds on the degree in $N$ for primitive and non-primitive graphs, and construct the primitive graphs of highest degree explicitly. We calculate the 4D primitive beta function numerically up to 17 loops. The qualitative behaviour is similar to the 0D series, with a small but systematic tendency for the 4D data to grow faster with $N$, indicating a correlation between periods and $O(N)$-symmetry factors. The zeros of the 4D primitive beta function approach their asymptotic locations quickly, but, like in 0D, the growth rate of the 4D primitive beta function does not match its asymptotics even at 17 loops.
  Our results improve on the knowledge of asymptotics in QFT by providing concrete analytic and numerical values, and putting individual observables into a broader context of $\phi^4_4$ theory in 0D and 4D. We demonstrate that even if certain quantities are in agreement with the asymptotics already below 10 loops, this must not be mistaken as evidence that overall an asymptotic regime has been reached.</description>

Abstract: It has been observed that, given an algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) on a manifold $M$ and an open cover $\{M_\alpha\}$ of $M$, it is typically not possible to recover the global algebra of observables on $M$ by simply gluing the underlying local algebras subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$. Instead of gluing local algebras, we introduce a gluing construction for AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ and we show that for simple examples of AQFTs, constructed out of geometric data, gluing the local AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ recovers the global AQFT on $M$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of coupled Burgers-like equations induced by conditional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that $Q$-conditional symmetries of the classical Burgers' equation express in terms of three functions satisfying a coupled system of Burgers-like equations. The search of conditional symmetries of this system leads to a system of five coupled Burgers-like equations. Using the latter system as a starting point, and iterating the procedure, an infinite hierarchy of systems made of an odd number of coupled Burgers-like equations can be conjectured. Moreover, starting from a pair of Burgers-like equations, a similar hierarchy of systems made of an even number of coupled Burgers-like equations may arise. We prove that these two infinite hierarchies can be unified, and each element of the hierarchy arises from the nonclassical symmetries of the previous one. Writing a generic element of this hierarchy as a matrix Burgers' equation, the existence of the matrix Hopf-Cole transformation allows for its linearization and the determination of its solutions. Finally, it is shown that each element of the hierarchy possesses a five-dimensional Lie algebra of classical point symmetries. Though these Lie algebras are realized in manifolds with different dimensionality, they are all isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions and the Accuracy and Dimensionality of Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this thesis is an efficient protocol to determine the frequencies of a signal $C(t)= \sum_k |a_k|^2 e^{i \omega_k t}$, which is given for a finite time, to a high degree of precision. Specifically, we develop a theorem that provides a fundamental precision guarantee. Additionally, we establish an approximation theory for spectral analysis through low-dimensional subspaces that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The signal processing routine relies on a symmetry between harmonic analysis and quantum mechanics. In this context, prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) are identified as the optimal information processing basis. To establish rigorous precision guarantees, we extend the concentration properties of PSWFs to a supremum bound and an $\ell_2$ bound on their derivatives. The new bounds allow us to refine the truncation estimates for the prolate sampling formula. We also provide a new geometrical insight into the commutation relation between an integral operator and a differential operator, both of which have PSWFs as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Resonances and resonance expansions for point interactions on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the resonances of the singular perturbation of the Laplacian on the half space $\Omega =\mathbb R^3_+$ given by the self-adjoint operator named $\delta$-interaction or point interaction. We will assume Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on $\partial \Omega$. At variance with the well known case of $\mathbb R^3$, the resonances constitute an infinite set, here completely characterized. Moreover, we prove that resonances have an asymptotic distribution satisfying a modified Weyl law. Finally we give applications of the results to the asymptotic behavior of the abstract Wave and Schr\"odinger dynamics generated by the Laplacian with a point interaction on the half-space.</description>

      <title>Linear Quivers at Large-$N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quiver theories constitute an important class of supersymmetric gauge theories with well-defined holographic duals. Motivated by holographic duality, we use localisation on $S^d$ to study long linear quivers at large-N. The large-N solution shows a remarkable degree of universality across dimensions, including $d = 4$ where quivers are genuinely superconformal. In that case we upgrade the solution of long quivers to quivers of any length.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Reaching Van den Broeck limit in linear response and Whitney limit in nonlinear response in edge mode quantum thermoelectrics and refrigeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in both the linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Van den Broeck limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Induced Inflation in the Minimal Quartic Extension of Einstein's Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficient $e$-foldings.</description>

      <title>Internally heated convection with rotation: bounds on heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates heat transport in rotating internally heated convection, for a horizontally periodic fluid between parallel plates under no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The main results are the proof of bounds on the mean temperature, $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$, and the heat flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$ at infinite Prandtl numbers where the Prandtl number is the nondimensional ratio of viscous to thermal diffusion. The lower bounds are functions of a Rayleigh number quantifying the ratio of internal heating to diffusion and the Ekman number, $E$, which quantifies the ratio of viscous diffusion to rotation. We utilise two different estimates on the vertical velocity, $w$, one pointwise in the domain (Yan 2004, J. Math. Phys., vol. 45(7), pp. 2718-2743) and the other an integral estimate over the domain (Constantin et al . 1999, Phys. D: Non. Phen., vol. 125, pp. 275-284), resulting in bounds valid for different regions of buoyancy-to-rotation dominated convection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that similar to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, for small $E$, the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection asymptotically scales as $E^{-4/3}$.This result is combined with heuristic arguments for internally heated and rotating convection to arrive at scaling laws for $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$ and $\mathcal{F}_B$ valid for arbitrary Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a unitary operator in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space, its unitary reduction to a subspace is defined. The application to quantum graphs is discussed. It is shown how the reduction allows to generate the scattering matrices of new quantum graphs from assembling of simpler graphs. The reduction of quantum channels is also defined. The implementation of the quantum gates corresponding to the reduced unitary operator is investigated, although no explicit construction is presented. The situation is different for the reduction of quantum channels for which explicit implementations are given.</description>

      <title>The Modified Toda Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, modified Toda (mToda) equation is generalized to form an integrable hierarchy in the framework of Sato theory, which is therefore called mToda hierarchy. Inspired by the fact that Toda hierarchy is 2-component generalization of usual KP hierarchy, mToda hierarchy is constructed from bilinear equations of 2-component first modified KP hierarchy, where we provide the corresponding equivalence with Lax formulations. Then it is demonstrated that there are Miura links between Toda and mToda hierarchies, which means the definition of mToda hierarchy here is reasonable. Finally, Darboux transformations of the Toda and mToda hierarchies are also constructed by using the aforementioned Miura links.</description>

      <title>Singular Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on the disk tends to $+\infty$ as the magnetic field tends to $+\infty$. This is an important step towards the analysis of the curvature effect in the case of general domains in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

      <title>Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>
