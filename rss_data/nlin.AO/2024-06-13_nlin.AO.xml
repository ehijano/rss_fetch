      <title>How social reinforcement learning can lead to metastable polarisation and the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous explanations for the persistence of polarization of opinions have typically included modelling assumptions that predispose the possibility of polarization (e.g.\ repulsive interactions). An exception is recent research showing that polarization is stable when agents form their opinions using reinforcement learning.
  We show that the polarization observed in this model is not stable, but exhibits consensus asymptotically with probability one. By constructing a link between the reinforcement learning model and the voter model, we argue that the observed polarization is metastable. Finally, we show that a slight modification in the learning process of the agents changes the model from being non-ergodic to being ergodic.
  Our results show that reinforcement learning may be a powerful method for modelling polarization in opinion dynamics, but that the tools appropriate for analysing such models crucially depend on the properties of the resulting systems. Properties which are determined by the details of the learning process.</description>

      <title>CrowdEgress: A Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Pedestrian Crowd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a simulation platform to study complex crowd behavior in social context. The agent-based model is extended based on the well-known social force model, and it mainly describes how agents interact with each other, and also with surrounding facilities such as walls, doors and exits. The simulation platform is compatible to FDS+Evac, and the input data in FDS+Evac could be imported into our simulation platform to create single-floor compartment geometry, and a flow solver is used to generate the roadmap towards exits. Most importantly, we plan to integrate advanced social and psychological theory into our simulation platform, especially investigating human behavior in emergency evacuation,such as pre-evacuation behavior, exit-selection activities, social group and herding effect and so forth.</description>
