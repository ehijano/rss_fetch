      <title>EphemerisSources.jl: Idiomatic Ephemeris Sourcing and Parsing in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Students and professionals in astronomy, astrodynamics, astrophysics, and other related fields often download and parse data about objects in our solar system -- ephemeris data -- from two major providers: JPL's publicly-available [Generic SPICE Kernels](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/) and JPL's [Horizons platform](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/). SPICE kernels are typically read through the SPICE Toolkit, which is available in a variety of programming languages, including the C Programming Language with `CSPICE` [@cspice]. The Julia packages [`CSPICE_jll.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/CSPICE_jll.jl) and [`SPICE.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl) expose many `CSPICE` functions through Julia functions. Julia users can load and interact with SPICE kernels through methods such as `SPICE.furnsh` and `SPICE.spkez`. Horizons provides data through a variety of methods, including email, command-line, graphical web interfaces, and a [REST API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html) [@horizons].
  This paper introduces several packages -- `SPICEKernels.jl`, `SPICEBodies.jl`, `HorizonsAPI.jl` and `HorizonsEphemeris.jl` -- which allow users to download and process Cartesian state vector data idiomatically, all from within Julia. While ephemeris data comes in many forms, including observer tables, osculating orbital elements, and binary formats, these packages currently target Cartesian state vector (position and velocity) ephemeris data. Through the use of these packages, users can share replicable code which automatically fetches data from publicly-available ephemeris sources, as opposed to manually including ephemeris data files with their source code distribution.</description>

      <title>Bringing together African &amp; European research communities with an inclusive astronomy conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.</description>

      <title>Instrument design and performance of the first seven stations of RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is the first in-ice radio array in the northern hemisphere for the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos via the coherent radio emission from neutrino-induced particle cascades within the ice. The array is currently in phased construction near Summit Station on the Greenland ice sheet, with 7~stations deployed during the first two boreal summer field seasons of 2021 and 2022. In this paper, we describe the installation and system design of these initial RNO-G stations, and discuss the performance of the array as of summer 2024.</description>

      <title>HiFAST: An HI Data Calibration and Imaging Pipeline for FAST III. Standing Wave Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standing waves existed in radio telescope data are primarily due to reflections among the instruments, which significantly impact the spectrum quality of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Eliminating these standing waves for FAST is challenging given the constant changes in their phases and amplitudes. Over a ten-second period, the phases shift by 18$^{\circ}$ while the amplitudes fluctuate by 6 mK. Thus, we developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter method to eliminate these standing waves for every individual spectrum. The FFT filter can decrease the root mean square (RMS) from 3.2 to 1.15 times the theoretical estimate. Compared to other methods such as sine fitting and running median, the FFT filter achieves a median RMS of approximately 1.2 times the theoretical expectation and the smallest scatter at 12%. Additionally, the FFT filter method avoids the flux loss issue encountered with some other methods. The FFT is also efficient in detecting harmonic radio frequency interference (RFI). In the FAST data, we identified three distinct types of harmonic RFI, each with amplitudes exceeding 100 mK and intrinsic frequency periods of 8.1, 0.5, and 0.37 MHz, respectively. The FFT filter, proven as the most effective method, is integrated into the HI data calibration and imaging pipeline for FAST (HiFAST, https://hifast.readthedocs.io).</description>

      <title>Database Design for SpExoDisks: A Database &amp; Web Portal for Spectra of Exoplanet-Forming Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data access -- or the availability of new and archival data for use by the larger community -- is key for scientific advancement. How data is presented, searched, and formatted determines accessibility and it can be difficult to find a solution that fits the needs of a given subdiscipline. We present a generalized roadmap for developing a specialty astronomy database with web application based on the development of the SpExoDisks (Spectra of Exoplanet forming Disks) database (spexodisks.com), which provides infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks. Expertise in an astronomy subdiscipline can provide two necessary components for creating a database: access to a large volume of specialized data and knowledge of how that data should be presented to the community. However, there are a variety of steps and decisions for database development that can fall outside astronomy expertise. Here we offer generalized discussions on design and process that are accompanied by real-world examples from the SpExoDisks developer team and website. Starting from the database portal design and data organization, we demonstrate on-demand data distribution and query using publicly accessible database software. These systems support interactive visualizations such that users can explore spectra directly from their browsers. We also offer details that show how the technical concepts in SpExoDisks are implemented, particularly emphasizing sustainability and long-term management of the codebase and processes. Finally, we illustrate the utility that a specialty website can offer to the community by providing a specific example of how the combined spectra from SpExoDisks can enhance our understanding of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>'Weather' in the LSST Camera: Investigating Patterns in Differenced Flat Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During electro-optical testing of the camera for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a unique low-signal pattern was found in differenced pairs of flat images used to create photon transfer curves, with peak-to-peak variations of a factor of 10^-3. A turbulent pattern of this amplitude was apparent in many differenced flat-fielded images. The pattern changes from image to image and shares similarities with atmospheric 'weather' turbulence patterns. We applied several strategies to determine the source of the turbulent pattern and found that it is representative of the mixing of the air and index of refraction variations caused by the internal camera purge system displacing air, which we are sensitive to due to our flat field project setup. Characterizing this changing environment with 2-D correlation functions of the 'weather' patterns provides evidence that the images reflect the changes in the camera environment due to the internal camera purge system. Simulations of the full optical system using the galsim and batoid codes show that the weather pattern affects the dispersion of the camera point-spread function at only the one part in 10^-4 level</description>

      <title>Towards a Cosmic-Ray Energy Scale with the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio detection of cosmic-ray (CR) induced extensive air showers with digital antenna arrays is a matured technique by now. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) has been measuring air-shower signals in conjunction with the particle detectors of the surface detector (SD) for over ten years. For an absolute determination of the CR energy with the Auger baseline detectors, the shower size estimator from the SD is calibrated with the energy scale of the fluorescence detector (FD). However, AERA has an independent access to the energy scale through the reconstructed radio signals. The hybrid detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory offer the unique opportunity to compare the two independent energy scales. In this contribution, we present our envisaged methodology for cross-checking the agreement between the energy scales of the FD and AERA using hybrid SD-AERA shower data and simulations. We show individual steps of our radio signal reconstruction and highlight the key ingredients for calibrated energy measurements.</description>

      <title>An iterative method to deblend AGN-Host contributions for Integral Field spectroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new iterative deblending method to separate the host galaxy (HG) and their Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission with the use of Integral Field spectroscopic (IFS) data. The method decomposes the resolved HG emission from the unresolved AGN emission by modelling the two-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profile of the point-spread function (PSF) and the two-dimensional SB HG continuum simultaneously per each monochromatic slide. Our method does not require any prior information about the observed SB profile or a detailed fitting of the PSF, making it ideal for the automatic analysis of large galaxy samples. In this work, we test the quality of our method, its advantages, and its disadvantages. We test our method by using a set of IFS mock data cubes to quantify the reliability of our deblending process and further compare our method with the {\sc QDeblend3D} analysis tool. Furthermore, we applied our method to three data cubes selected from the MaNGA survey according to the dominance of either its HG or its AGN. We show that our deblending method is capable of disengaging the bright, nonresolved AGN emission from the HG continuum and its narrow emission lines. However, the decoupling depends on how well the IFS spatially resolves the PSF, and on the relative flux intensity of the HG-AGN. Therefore, the method is ideal for disentangling the bright-flux contribution from AGN-dominated spectra.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to estimate mid-infrared fluxes from WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While WISE is the largest, best quality infrared all-sky survey to date, a smaller coverage mission, Spitzer, was designed to have better sensitivity and spatial resolution at similar wavelengths. Confusion and contamination in WISE data result in discrepancies between them. We present a novel approach to work with WISE measurements with the goal of maintaining both its high coverage and vast amount of data while taking full advantage of the higher sensitivity and spatial resolution of Spitzer. We have applied machine learning (ML) techniques to a complete WISE data sample of open cluster members, using a training set of paired data from high-quality Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), MIPS and IRAC, and allWISE catalogs, W1 (3.4 {\mu}m) to W4 (22 {\mu}m) bands. We have tested several ML regression models with the aim of predicting mid-infrared fluxes at MIPS1 (24 {\mu}m) and IRAC4 (8 {\mu}m) bands from WISE fluxes and quality flags. In addition, to improve the prediction quality, we have implemented feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant WISE variables. We have notably enhanced WISE detection capabilities, mostly at lowest magnitudes, which previously showed the largest discrepancies with Spitzer. In our particular case, extremely randomized trees was found to be the best algorithm to predict mid-infrared fluxes from WISE variables. We have tested our results in the SED of members of IC 348. We show discrepancies in the measurements of Spitzer and WISE and demonstrate the good concordance of our predicted fluxes with the real ones. ML is a fast and powerful tool that can be used to find hidden relationships between datasets, as the ones that exist between WISE and Spitzer fluxes. We believe this approach could be employed for other samples from the allWISE catalog with SEIP positional counterparts, and in other astrophysical studies with analogous discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Extraction of gravitational wave signals in realistic LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is being developed by ESA with NASA participation. As it has recently passed the Mission Adoption milestone, models of the instruments and noise performance are becoming more detailed, and likewise prototype data analyses must as well. Assumptions such as Gaussianity, Stationarity, and continuous data continuity are unrealistic, and must be replaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data analysis methods adapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end, the LISA Data Challenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and unequal constellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data interruptions and instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact of these data artifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black Hole properties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and gaps is necessary for effective parameter estimation. We find that straightforward mitigation techniques can significantly suppress artifacts, albeit leaving a non-negligible impact on aspects of the science.</description>

      <title>Capturing primordial non-Gaussian signatures in the late Universe by multi-scale extrema of the cosmic log-density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct two new summary statistics, the scale-dependent peak height function (scale-PKHF) and the scale-dependent valley depth function (scale-VLYDF) of matter density, and forecast their constraining power on primordial non-Gaussianity and cosmological parameters based on \textsc{Quijote} and \textsc{Quijote-PNG} simulations at $z=0$. With the Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that these statistics outperform the power spectrum and bispectrum. Key findings include: (1) the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ obtained from the scale-VLYDF/scale-PKHF is 1.59/1.10 times tighter than that from the joint analysis of power spectrum and bispectrum; (2) the combination of the two statistics yields a slight improvement in constraining $\{f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}, f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}\}$ over the power spectrum-bispectrum combination, and provides a 1.39-fold improvement in the constraint on $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho}$; (3) after incorporating the power spectrum with our new statistics, parameter constraints surpass those from power spectrum-bispectrum combination by factors up to 2.93. This work offers an effective scheme for extracting primordial signals from the late Universe, paving the way for further breakthroughs in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

      <title>CODES: Benchmarking Coupled ODE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CODES, a benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of surrogate architectures for coupled ODE systems. Besides standard metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and inference time, CODES provides insights into surrogate behaviour across multiple dimensions like interpolation, extrapolation, sparse data, uncertainty quantification and gradient correlation. The benchmark emphasizes usability through features such as integrated parallel training, a web-based configuration generator, and pre-implemented baseline models and datasets. Extensive documentation ensures sustainability and provides the foundation for collaborative improvement. By offering a fair and multi-faceted comparison, CODES helps researchers select the most suitable surrogate for their specific dataset and application while deepening our understanding of surrogate learning behaviour.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>
