      <title>Direct Experimental Constraints on the Spatial Extent of a Neutrino Wavepacket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique system to study quantum coherence in fundamental systems due to their extremely weak interaction probabilities. The quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and theoretical predictions for the spatial width of neutrino wavepackets vary by many orders of magnitude. In weak nuclear decay, the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x}$, is related to the spatial wavefunction of its parent at production. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$, of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC) decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling $^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic charge sensitive detector. The lower limit on the spatial coherence of the recoil daughter was found to be $\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$ pm, which implies the system remains in a spatially coherent state much larger than the nuclear scale. Further, this implies a lower limit on the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x} \geq 35$ nm, which is more than five orders of magnitude more stringent than the limits from all combined reactor oscillation experiments. These results have wide-reaching implications in several areas including quantum coherence, the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>A first extraction of the weak magnetism form factor and Fierz interference term from the $^{114}$In $\rightarrow$ $^{114}$Sn Gamow-Teller transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum shape measurements in nuclear $\beta$ decay can be used to test physics beyond the Standard Model with results being complementary to high-energy collider experiments. In particular, Beyond Standard Model sensitivity of the weak interaction is expressed through the so-called Fierz interference term. Additionally, the $\beta$ spectrum shape is a useful tool to probe Standard Model effects, among which the most prominent is \textit{weak magnetism}, a higher-order recoil correction induced by nuclear pion exchange. To study effects in the $\beta$ spectrum shape at a precision level competitive with the LHC, a new spectrometer was designed and built. It consists of a 3D low-pressure gas electron tracker and a plastic scintillator used for triggering the data acquisition and recording the $\beta$ particle energy. In this Letter, the results from $\beta$ spectrum shape measurements on the allowed Gamow-Teller transition $^{114}\text{In} \rightarrow ^{114}\text{Sn}$ are presented, including a first extraction of the weak magnetism form factor in the high nuclear mass range and a new estimate of the $90\%$ confidence interval for the Fierz interference term.</description>

      <title>Information entropy for central $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions in the UrQMD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicity information entropy in central $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at impact parameters of 0$-$3 fm are calculated at various center of mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$) of 5.0, 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27.0, 32.0, 35.0, 39.0, and 54.4 GeV using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (UrQMD). The simulations in UrQMD model are compared with hydro modes with three different equations of state (EoS) and also with a default mode without hydrodynamics. The study reveals that the information entropies of baryons, net-baryons and net-protons with different equations of state in the hydro modes exhibit first decreases and then slowly increases with the increase of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, while those of hadrons and anti-hadrons, antibaryons show a monotonous increase with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$. An enhancement is found around $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ $\sim$ 30 GeV potentially corresponding to the critical endpoint with chiral hadron gas EoS and Bag model EoS.</description>

      <title>$K^+ N$ elastic scatterings for estimation of in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the low-energy $K^+N$ elastic scatterings in the context of the in-medium quark condensate with strange quarks. The chiral ward identity connects the in-medium quark condensate to the soft limit value of the pseudoscalar correlation function evaluated in nuclear matter. The in-medium correlation function of the psuedoscalar fields with strangeness describes in-medium kaon propagation and is obtained by kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in the low density approximation. We construct the kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes in chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order and add some terms of the next-to-next-to-leading order with the strange quark mass to improve expansion of the strange quark sector. We also consider the effect of a possible broad resonance state around $P_\mathrm{lab} = 600$ MeV/c for $I=0$ reported in the previous study. The low energy constants are determined by existent $K^+N$ scattering data. We obtain good reproduction of the $K^+p$ scattering amplitude by chiral perturbation theory, while the description of the $KN$ amplitude with $I=0$ is not so satisfactory due to the lack of low energy data. Performing analytic continuation of the scattering amplitudes obtained by chiral perturbation theory to the soft limit, we estimate the in-medium strange quark condensate.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reevaluation of $ft$-values in superallowed $\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of the $ft$ values in superallowed nuclear $\beta$ decays crucial for the precise determination of $V_{ud}$ and low-energy tests of the electroweak Standard Model. It consists of the first, fully data-driven analysis of the nuclear $\beta$ decay form factor, that utilizes isospin relations to connect the nuclear charged weak distribution to the measurable charge distributions. This prescription supersedes previous shell-model estimations, and allows for a rigorous quantification of theory uncertainties in $f$ which is absent in the existing literature. Our new evaluation shows an overall downward shift of the central values of $f$ at the level of 0.01\%.</description>

      <title>A Light-Front Model for the Transition Distribution Amplitudes for Backward Timelike Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To access information on the internal structure of the nucleon, data from a variety of scattering experiments can be analyzed, in regimes where the information factorizes from an otherwise known scattering amplitude. A recent development, promising new insight, is the study of exclusive reactions in the backward kinematical region, where the information can be encoded in Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs). We model the photon-to-nucleon TDAs, entering the factorized description of backward Timelike Compton Scattering, using techniques of light-front dynamics to integrate information from a quark model for the photon and the nucleon. We include the results of numerical predictions that could inform further experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron--Ion Collider.</description>
