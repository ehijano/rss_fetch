      <title>The Eisenhart Lift and Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known in general relativity that trajectories of Hamiltonian systems lift to geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes, an example of a more general phenomenon known as the "Eisenhart lift." We review and expand upon the benefits of this correspondence for dynamical systems theory. One benefit is the use of curvature and conjugate points to study the stability of Hamiltonian systems. Another benefit is that this lift unfolds a Hamiltonian system into a family of ODEs akin to a moduli space. One such family arises from the conformal invariance of lightlike geodesics, by which any Hamiltonian system unfolds into a "conformal class" of non-diffeomorphic ODEs with solutions in common. By utilizing higher-index versions of pp-waves, a similar lift and conformal class are shown to exist for certain second-order complex ODEs. Another such family occurs by lifting to a Riemannian metric that is dual to a pp-wave, a process that in certain cases yields a "square root" for the Hamiltonian. We prove a two-point boundary result for the family of ODEs arising from this lift, as well as the existence of a constant of the motion generalizing conservation of energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show various uncertainty principles for the Fourier transform on harmonic manifolds of rank one. In particular, we derive a Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a Morgen theorem, an uncertainty principle for the Schr\"odinger equation and a version of H\"omanders theorem. Furthermore, we generalise the in the Euclidean case well-known Hausdorff-Young inequality for the Fourier transform, to harmonic manifolds of rank one.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Lorentzian Sobolev calculus of Beran et al.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (and barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Thinner Latent Spaces: Detecting dimension and imposing invariance through autoencoder gradient constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Autoencoders are a neural network architecture that imposes orthogonality conditions between the gradients of latent variables towards achieving disentangled representations of data. In this letter we show that orthogonality relations within the latent layer of the network can be leveraged to infer the intrinsic dimensionality of nonlinear manifold data sets (locally characterized by the dimension of their tangent space), while simultaneously computing encoding and decoding (embedding) maps. We outline the relevant theory relying on differential geometry, and describe the corresponding gradient-descent optimization algorithm. The method is applied to standard data sets and we highlight its applicability, advantages, and shortcomings. In addition, we demonstrate that the same computational technology can be used to build coordinate invariance to local group actions when defined only on a (reduced) submanifold of the embedding space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Riemannian version of a classical Euclidean result: every level set of the capacitary potential of a starshaped ring is starshaped. In the Riemannian setting, we restrict ourselves to starshaped rings in a warped product of an open interval and the unit sphere. We also extend the result by replacing the Laplacian with the $q$-Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the universal cover of a normal complex algebraic variety admitting a faithful complex representation of its fundamental group is an analytic Zariski open subset of a holomorphically convex complex space. This is a non-proper version of the Shafarevich conjecture. More generally we define a class of subset of the Betti stack for which the covering space trivializing the corresponding local systems has this property. Secondly, we show that for any complex local system $V$ on a normal complex algebraic variety $X$ there is an algebraic map $f \colon X\to Y$ contracting precisely the subvarieties on which $V$ is isotrivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples and discuss about the implications of these results for the 3+1 formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>

Abstract: In both real and complex cases, we establish the connection of the problem about $2$-dimensional linear subspaces the most deviating from the coordinate ones with one simply formulated optimization problem for isoperimetric polygons in Euclidean spaces.
  This study thereby provides a new geometrical point of view on the $2$-dimensional case of the problem formulated by Goreinov, Tyrtyshnikov and Zamarashkin \cite{GTZ1997}, and at the same time presents a new application of the results by Hausmann and Knutson \cite{HK1997}.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part III. A Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality and applications to a variety of geometric variational problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.05504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a novel type of Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality (for generalised weakly differentiable functions on varifolds), we establish a finite upper bound of the geodesic diameter of generalised compact connected surfaces-with-boundary of arbitrary dimension in Euclidean space in terms of the mean curvatures of the surface and its boundary. Our varifold setting includes smooth immersions, surfaces with finite Willmore energy, two-convex hypersurfaces in level-set mean curvature flow, integral currents with prescribed mean curvature vector, area minimising integral chains with coefficients in a complete normed commutative group, varifold solutions to Plateau's problem furnished by min-max methods or by Brakke flow, and compact sets solving Plateau problems based on \v{C}ech homology. Due to the generally inevitable presence of singularities, path-connectedness was previously known neither for the class of varifolds (even in the absence of boundary) nor for the solutions to the Plateau problems considered.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure and existence of reducible spherical conical metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conformal metric ${\rm d}s^{2}$ with finitely many conical singularities of constant Gaussian curvature $K=1$ on a compact Riemann surface is referred to as a spherical conical metric. When the associated monodromy group of ${\rm d}s^{2}$ is diagonalizable, we refer to ${\rm d}s^{2}$ as a reducible spherical conical metric. The simplest case of a reducible spherical conical metric is a `football', which denotes a 2-sphere with a spherical conical metric that has precisely two singularities separated by a distance of $\pi$. This study delves into the intrinsic geometric structure and existence of reducible spherical conical metrics on compact Riemann surfaces. We demonstrate that any such spherical surface can be divided into a finite number of pieces by cutting along a set of suitable geodesics, which connect the conical singularities and some smooth points of the metric. Especially, each piece is isometric to a portion obtained by cutting a football along a geodesic that joins the two conical singularities. As an application, an angle condition for the existence of such a metric is presented. Most notably, our study demonstrates the existence of a reducible spherical conical metric where all the saddle points of a Morse function are located on the same geodesic.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that, by the Reeb stability theorem, the leaf space of a Riemannian foliation with compact leaves is an orbifold. We prove that, under mild completeness conditions, the leaf space of a Killing Riemannian foliation is a diffeological quasifold: as a diffeological space, it is locally modelled by quotients of Cartesian space by countable groups acting affinely. Furthermore, we prove that the holonomy groupoid of the foliation is, locally, Morita equivalent to the action groupoid of a countable group acting affinely on Cartesian space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence problems for closed $G_2$-structures with negative Ricci curvature, and we prove the $G_2$-Goldberg conjecture for noncompact manifolds. We first show that no closed manifold admits a closed $G_2$-structure with negative Ricci curvature. In the noncompact setting, we show that no complete manifold admits a closed $G_2$-structure with Ricci curvature pinched sufficiently close to a negative constant. As a consequence, an Einstein closed $G_2$-structure on a complete manifold must be torsion-free. In addition, when the Einstein metric is incomplete, we find restrictions on lengths of geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any holomorphic geometric structure of affine type on an Oeljeklaus- Toma manifold is locally homogeneous. For locally conformal K\"ahler Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds we prove that all holomorphic geometric structures, and also all holomorphic Cartan geometries, on them are locally homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Covariant Schr\"odinger Operator and $L^2$-Vanishing Property on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a Hermitian vector bundle over $M$ equipped with a metric covariant derivative $\nabla$. We consider the operator $H_{X,V}=\nabla^{\dagger}\nabla+\nabla_{X}+ V$, where $\nabla^{\dagger}$ is the formal adjoint of $\nabla$ with respect to the inner product in the space of square-integrable sections of $\mathcal{E}$, $X$ is a smooth (real) vector field on $M$, and $V$ is a fiberwise self-adjoint, smooth section of the endomorphism bundle $\textrm{End }\mathcal{E}$. We give a sufficient condition for the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $H_{X,V}$. As a corollary, putting $X\equiv 0$ and working in the setting of a Clifford module equipped with a Clifford connection $\nabla$, we obtain the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $D^2$, where $D$ is the Dirac operator corresponding to $\nabla$. In particular, when $\mathcal{E}=\Lambda_{\mathbb{C}}^{k}T^*M$ and $D^2$ is the Hodge--deRham Laplacian on (complex-valued) $k$-forms, we recover some recent vanishing results for $L^2$-harmonic (complex-valued) $k$-forms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we completely classify nontrivial non-flat three-dimensional complete gradient Yamabe solitons. Furthermore, by considering Ricci solitons from the point of view of Yamabe solitons, we provide a proof of the complete classification of nontrivial two-dimensional complete gradient Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities for CR-submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two kinds of curvature invariants of Riemannian manifold equip\-ped with a complex distribution $D$ (for example, a CR-submanifold of an almost Hermitian manifold) related to sets of pairwise orthogonal subspaces of the distribution. One kind of invariant is based on the mutual curvature of the subspaces and another is similar to Chen's $\delta$-invariants. We compare the mutual curvature invariants with Chen-type invariants and prove geometric inequalities with intermediate mean curvature squared for CR-submanifolds in almost Hermitian spaces. In the case of a set of complex planes, we introduce and study curvature invariants based on the concept of holomorphic bisectional curvature. As applications, we give consequences of the absence of some $D$-minimal CR-submanifolds in almost Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply methods of algebraic integral geometry to prove a special case of the Gaussian kinematic formula of Adler-Taylor. The idea, suggested already by Adler and Taylor, is to view the GKF as the limit of spherical kinematic formulas for spheres of large dimension $N$ and curvature $\frac 1 N$.</description>

      <title>$G_2$-Manifolds from 4d N=1 Theories, Part I: Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new $G_2$-holonomy manifolds, which geometrize the Gaiotto-Kim 4d N=1 duality domain walls of 5d N=1 theories. These domain walls interpolate between different extended Coulomb branch phases of a given 5d superconformal field theory. Our starting point is the geometric realization of such a 5d superconformal field theory and its extended Coulomb branch in terms of M-theory on a non-compact singular Calabi-Yau three-fold and its K\"ahler cone. We construct the 7-manifold that realizes the domain wall in M-theory by fibering the Calabi-Yau three-fold over a real line, whilst varying its K\"ahler parameters as prescribed by the domain wall construction. In particular this requires the Calabi-Yau fiber to pass through a canonical singularity at the locus of the domain wall. Due to the 4d N=1 supersymmetry that is preserved on the domain wall, we expect the resulting 7-manifold to have holonomy $G_2$. Indeed, for simple domain wall theories, this construction results in 7-manifolds, which are known to admit torsion-free $G_2$-holonomy metrics. We develop several generalizations to new 7-manifolds, which realize domain walls in 5d SQCD theories and walls between 5d theories which are UV-dual.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the hyperbolic elastic flow: Convergence, quantization and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the elastic flow of closed curves and of open curves with clamped boundary conditions in the hyperbolic plane. While global existence and convergence toward critical points for initial data with sufficiently small energy is already known, this study pioneers an investigation into the flow's singular behavior. We prove a convergence theorem without assuming smallness of the initial energy, coupled with a quantification of potential singularities: Each singularity carries an energy cost of at least 8. Moreover, the blow-ups of the singularities are explicitly classified. A further contribution is an explicit understanding of the singular limit of the elastic flow of $\lambda$-figure-eights, a class of curves that previously served in showing sharpness of the energy threshold 16 for the smooth convergence of the elastic flow of closed curves.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework of intelligence and consciousness based on Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</description>
