      <title>Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2 via Attractive Polaron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistivity in the Antiferromagnetic Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of the half-filled antiferromagnetic (AF) one-band Hubbard model under an external magnetic field using the single-site dynamical mean-field approximation (DMFT). Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms driving the magnetoresistivity behavior. We analyze the dependence of magnetoresistivity on temperature and the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing insights into the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and transport properties in AF systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence for possible quantum spin liquid behavior in a two-dimensional Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mott insulators with localized magnetic moments will exhibit a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state when the quantum fluctuations are strong enough to suppress the ordering of the spins. Such an entangled state will give rise to collective excitations, in which spin and charge information are carried separately. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on single-layer 1T-TaS2 show a flat band around the zone center and a gap opening of about 200 meV in the low temperature, indicating 2D Mott insulating nature in the system. This flat band is dispersionless in momentum space but shows anomalously broad width around the zone center and the spectral weight decays rapidly as momentum increases. The observation is described as a spectral continuum from electron fractionalization, corroborated by a low energy effective model.The intensity of the flat band is reduced by surface doping with magnetic adatoms and the gap is closing, a result from the interaction between spin impurities coupled with spinons and the chargons, which gives rise to a charge redistribution. Doping with nonmagnetic impurities behaves differently as the chemical potential shift dominates. These findings provide insight into the QSL states of strongly correlated electrons on 2D triangular lattices.</description>

      <title>Understanding the evolution of the magnetic ground state in Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the quadruple perovskite Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$, in which we discover a robust spin-lattice coupled ground state characterized by a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \sim$ 257 K. The system's unique structural motif of three symmetrically distinct magnetic ions, including Ru dimers separated by non-magnetic layers, is intimately correlated with its magnetic behavior, as evidenced by temperature-dependent diffraction measurements and specific heat data. The powder neutron diffraction patterns at 13 K showed that the spins within the dimers are antiparallel, leading to a net zero moment contribution and a staggered arrangement of the triangular layers formed by the Ru moments within the corner-shared octahedra along the $c$-axis. The low-temperature specific heat revealed an extra boson peak contribution from optical modes with a maximum vibrational energy of $\sim$55cm$^{-1}$. The charge transport exhibited variable-range hopping (VRH) behaviour below $T_N$, with a stronger energy-dependence than expected from the Efros-Shklovskii model, suggesting the presence of multiparticle correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Spanner: Twisting Superconductors with Vortex Beam via Higgs Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--known as vortex beams--has broadened the scope of understanding and applications of light's angular momentum. Optical tweezers using OAM, often referred to as optical spanners, have significantly expanded the tunability of optical manipulation. A key frontier now lies in understanding how vortex beams interact with quantum states of matter. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a superconductor under vortex beam illumination and demonstrate the transfer of angular momentum from light to the superconducting collective mode, resulting in mechanical rotation. Our findings open a pathway for optical manipulation in the quantum regime, which we term the quantum optical spanner.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned spin chains in brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction combined with thermodynamic measurements and density-functional calculations, we uncover the microscopic magnetic model of the mineral brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, and its evolution upon compression. The formation of antiferromagnetic spin chains with the effective intrachain coupling of $J\simeq 100$\,K is attributed to the occurrence of longer Cu--Cu distances and larger Cu--O--Cu bond angles between the structural chains within the layers of the brochantite structure. These zigzag spin chains are additionally stabilized by ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$ between second neighbors and moderately frustrated by several antiferromagnetic couplings that manifest themselves in the reduced N\'eel temperature of the material. Pressure tuning of the brochantite structure keeps its monoclinic symmetry unchanged and leads to the growth of antiferromagnetic $J$ with the rate of 3.2\,K/GPa, although this trend is primarily caused by the enhanced ferromagnetic couplings $J_2$. Our results show that the nature of magnetic couplings in brochantite and in other layered Cu$^{2+}$ minerals is controlled by the size of the lattice translation along their structural chains and by the extent of the layer buckling.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pair Distribution Function and Half Polarized Neutron Powder Diffraction at the HB-2A Powder Diffractometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local magnetic order and anisotropy are often central for understanding fundamental behavior and emergent functional properties in quantum materials and beyond. Advances in neutron powder diffraction experiments and analysis tools now allow for quantitative determination. We demonstrate this here with complementary total neutron scattering and polarized neutron measurements on the HB-2A neutron powder diffractometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). In recent years, magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for probing local magnetic spin ordering of magnetic materials. This method can be broadly applied to any magnetic material but is particularly effective for studying systems with short-range magnetic order, such as materials with reduced dimensionality, geometrically frustrated magnets, thermoelectrics, multiferroics, and correlated paramagnets. Magnetic anisotropy often underpins the short-range order adopted. Half-polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) can be used to determine the local susceptibility tensor on the magnetic sites to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Combining the techniques of mPDF and pNPD can therefore provide valuable insights into local magnetic behavior. A series of measurements optimized for these techniques are presented as exemplar cases focused on frustrated materials where short-range order dominates, these include measurements to ultra-low temperature (&lt;100 mK) not typically accessible for such experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\'eel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the N\'eel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the N\'eel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains N\'eel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.</description>

      <title>Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</description>

Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tunable Generalized Wigner Crystal and Fractional Chern Insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the forming of low-energy flat bands, the moir\'e superlattices of the transition metal dichalcogenides are fascinating platforms for studying novel correlated states when such flat bands are fractionally filled, with the Coulomb interaction dominating. Here, we demonstrate that pressure can efficiently tune the flatness and quantum geometry of the single-particle bands in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$). By fractionally filling the topmost valence band, we find that pressure can act as a flexible means to modulate the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and the generalized Wigner crystal (GWC) and control their many-body topological phase transitions. Moreover, our results indicate a remarkable correspondence between the single-particle band geometry and the formation of FCI and GWC. As the recent experiments report the presence of FCI phases in $\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$, our predictions could be readily implemented experimentally.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Epstein zeta method for many-body lattice sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body interactions arise naturally in the perturbative treatment of classical and quantum many-body systems and play a crucial role in the description of condensed matter systems. In the case of three-body interactions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for the quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the resulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a high-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work solves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable representation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over products of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this approach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to minutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums. We demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases linearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct summation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice, corresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a laptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and compare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving full precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we apply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system with Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM three-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the face-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with increasing ATM coupling strength. This work establishes the mathematical foundation for an ongoing investigation into the influence of many-body interactions on the stability of matter.</description>

      <title>Resonant x-ray scattering study of charge-density wave correlations in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ under uniaxial stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the uniaxial stress response of charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations in detwinned single crystals of the high temperature superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO$_{6+x}$) with $0.40 \leq x \leq 0.93$ (hole-doping levels $0.072 \leq p \leq 0.168$) by means of Cu $L_3$-edge resonant energy-integrated x-ray scattering (REXS). We show that the influence of uniaxial stress is strongly doping dependent: the quasi-two-dimensional CDW is enhanced by in-plane uniaxial stress in a wide hole doping range ($0.45 \leq x \leq 0.80$), but only barely affected in the most underdoped and optimally doped samples ($x = 0.40$ and 0.93), where the CDW correlation length is minimal. A stress-induced three-dimensionally long-range ordered (3D) CDW was observed only in YBCO$_{6.50}$ and YBCO$_{6.67}$. The temperature dependence of the 3D CDW clearly indicates a strong competition with superconductivity. Based on the systematic strain-, doping-, and temperature-dependent REXS measurements reported here, we discuss the relationship between charge order and superconductivity in YBCO$_{6+x}$ and other cuprates.</description>

      <title>Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Coincident onset of charge order and pseudogap in a homogeneous high-temperature superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates requires knowledge of the metallic phase it evolves from, particularly the pseudogap profoundly affecting the electronic properties at low carrier densities. A key question is the influence of chemical disorder, which is ubiquitous but exceedingly difficult to model. Using resonant x-ray scattering, we identified two-dimensional charge order in stoichiometric YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ ($T_c$ = 80 K), which is nearly free of chemical disorder. The charge order amplitude shows a concave temperature dependence and vanishes sharply at $T^*$ = 200 K, the onset of a prominent pseudogap previously determined by spectroscopy, suggesting a causal link between these phenomena. The gradual onset of charge order in other cuprates is thus likely attributable to an inhomogeneous distribution of charge ordering temperatures due to disorder induced by chemical substitution. The relationship between the pseudogap and the disorder-induced gradual freeze-out of charge carriers remains a central issue in research on high-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC) near $80$K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance SC within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens SC by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens SC. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional SC of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Fermi-surface in the current-driven Hidden state of 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the insulating state in 1T-TaS$_2$ has long been a subject of debate. A short current pulse transforms this insulating state into a metastable metallic phase. Using micro-ARPES, we investigate the electronic structure of this phase and uncover spatially dependent modifications caused by the current pulse. In some regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while others remain gapped. Detailed band structure analysis reveals that the metallic regions exhibit an electronic structure similar to that observed in the high-temperature phase of 1T-TaS$_2$, characterized by suppressed energy gaps and bands crossing the Fermi level. Furthermore, the metallic and insulating regions display distinct dispersions along the out-of-plane direction. These observations suggest a scenario in which the current pulse breaks the star-of-David dimers characteristic of the insulating phase, implicating these dimers as the likely origin of the insulating behavior in 1T-TaS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave solutions of the Hubbard model in the composite operator formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charge density wave phase in the strongly correlated Hubbard model without any other broken symmetry phase. Starting from the atomic Hamiltonian with no hopping, we generate quasiparticle operators corresponding to holons and doublons in the strongly correlated limit of the repulsive Hubbard model. We develop a real space composite operator formalism using the equation of motion technique to include the intersite hopping perturbatively. Our fully self-consistent calculation stabilizes multiple unidirectional translation symmetry broken states within the doping range $\delta=0.07$ to $0.2$. The charge-ordered states become increasingly unfavorable with hole-doping. The unidirectional density waves manifest as periodic modulations of half-filled Mott regions separated by hole-rich regions. Notably, density wave solutions with periods of $3$ to $8$ lattice spacing remain energetically higher than those with larger periods. Quenched disorder on the charge-ordered states induces the merging of the Mott regions and, consequently, forms short-ranged charge modulations. The density of states shows signatures of strongly correlated Mott regions, potentially relevant to the physics of underdoped cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient algorithm is constructed for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks under periodic boundary conditions. The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more data points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.</description>

Abstract: The simultaneous application of high magnetic fields and high pressures for controlling magnetic ground states is important for testing our understanding of many-body quantum theory. However, the implementation for neutron scattering experiments presents a technical challenge. To overcome this challenge we present an optimized pressure-cell design with a novel bullet shape, which is compatible with horizontal-field magnets, in particular the high-field magnet operating at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The cell enabled neutron diffraction and spectroscopy measurements with the combination of three extreme conditions: high pressures, high magnetic fields, and dilution temperatures, simultaneously reaching 0.7 GPa, 25.9 T, and 200 mK. Our results demonstrate the utility of informed material choices and the efficiency of finite-element analysis for future pressure-cell designs to be used in combination with magnetic fields and dilution temperatures for neutron scattering purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</description>

      <title>Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>More About the Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of three-dimensional $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found ``extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconducting phases are distinguished by broken symmetries in their order parameters. Here, we report the discovery of an exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene at high displacement fields, marked by its coexistence with both a stripe charge order and the anomalous Hall effect. In angle-resolved transport measurements, the onset of stripe order is manifested as thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis, with highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Upon cooling, superconductivity emerges exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels. This anisotropic superconducting phase exhibits multiple first-order hysteretic transitions. Pronounced thermal hysteresis-between warming and cooling across the superconducting transition-suggests a melting transition of the underlying stripe phase. Additionally, magnetic-field-induced switching-similar to phenomena reported in tetra- and pentalayer graphene-supports the chiral nature of the superconducting state. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripy Hall crystal.</description>
