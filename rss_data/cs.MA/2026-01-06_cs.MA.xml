      <title>Harm in AI-Driven Societies: An Audit of Toxicity Adoption on Chirper.ai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous agents that participate in online social ecosystems, where interactions are sequential, cumulative, and only partially controlled. While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.
  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.
  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>

      <title>ARIES: A Scalable Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework for Real-Time Epidemiological Surveillance and Outbreak Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global health surveillance is currently facing a challenge of Knowledge Gaps. While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Qualitative Laboratory: Theory Prototyping and Hypothesis Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in social science is to generate rich qualitative hypotheses about how diverse social groups might interpret new information. This article introduces and illustrates a novel methodological approach for this purpose: sociological persona simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which we frame as a "qualitative laboratory". We argue that for this specific task, persona simulation offers a distinct advantage over established methods. By generating naturalistic discourse, it overcomes the lack of discursive depth common in vignette surveys, and by operationalizing complex worldviews through natural language, it bypasses the formalization bottleneck of rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To demonstrate this potential, we present a protocol where personas derived from a sociological theory of climate reception react to policy messages. The simulation produced nuanced and counter-intuitive hypotheses - such as a conservative persona's rejection of a national security frame - that challenge theoretical assumptions. We conclude that this method, used as part of a "simulation then validation" workflow, represents a superior tool for generating deeply textured hypotheses for subsequent empirical testing.</description>

      <title>A Modular Reference Architecture for MCP-Servers Enabling Agentic BIM Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic workflows driven by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to Building Information Modelling (BIM), enabling natural-language retrieval, modification and generation of IFC models. Recent work has begun adopting the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a uniform tool-calling interface for LLMs, simplifying the agent side of BIM interaction. While MCP standardises how LLMs invoke tools, current BIM-side implementations are still authoring tool-specific and ad hoc, limiting reuse, evaluation, and workflow portability across environments. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular reference architecture for MCP servers that enables API-agnostic, isolated and reproducible agentic BIM interactions. From a systematic analysis of recurring capabilities in recent literature, we derive a core set of requirements. These inform a microservice architecture centred on an explicit adapter contract that decouples the MCP interface from specific BIM-APIs. A prototype implementation using IfcOpenShell demonstrates feasibility across common modification and generation tasks. Evaluation across representative scenarios shows that the architecture enables reliable workflows, reduces coupling, and provides a reusable foundation for systematic research.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mapping of unknown environments is a critical challenge, particularly in scenarios where time is limited. Multi-agent systems can enhance efficiency through collaboration, but the scalability of motion-planning algorithms remains a key limitation. Reinforcement learning has been explored as a solution, but existing approaches are constrained by the limited input size required for effective learning, restricting their applicability to discrete environments. This work addresses that limitation by leveraging autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction, compressing high-fidelity occupancy maps into latent state vectors while preserving essential spatial information. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedural generation algorithm based on Perlin noise, designed to generate topologically complex training environments that simulate asteroid fields, caves and forests. These environments are used for training the autoencoder and the navigation algorithm using a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for decentralized coordination. We introduce a weighted consensus mechanism that modulates reliance on shared data via a tuneable trust parameter, ensuring robustness to accumulation of errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system scales effectively with number of agents and generalizes well to unfamiliar, structurally distinct environments and is resilient in communication-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Warp-Cortex: An Asynchronous, Memory-Efficient Architecture for Million-Agent Cognitive Scaling on Consumer Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks suffer from linear memory scaling, rendering "System 2" parallel reasoning impractical on consumer hardware. We present Warp Cortex, an asynchronous architecture that theoretically enables million-agent cognitive scaling by decoupling agent logic from physical memory. Through Singleton Weight Sharing and a novel Topological Synapse--inspired by hybrid landmarking techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA)--we reduce memory complexity from O(N * L) to O(1) for weights and O(N * k) for context, where k &lt;&lt; L. By treating the KV-cache as a point cloud in latent space, we apply witness-complex-inspired sparsification to preserve persistent homological features of the context manifold. On a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, we empirically demonstrate 100 concurrent agents at 2.2 GB total VRAM, with theoretical capacity exceeding 1,000 agents before compute latency becomes the bottleneck. We further introduce Referential Injection, a non-intrusive KV-cache update mechanism that allows asynchronous sub-agents to influence primary generation without stream disruption.</description>

      <title>Learning Resilient Elections with Adversarial GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</description>

      <title>Lying with Truths: Open-Channel Multi-Agent Collusion for Belief Manipulation via Generative Montage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition to autonomous agents synthesizing real-time information, their reasoning capabilities introduce an unexpected attack surface. This paper introduces a novel threat where colluding agents steer victim beliefs using only truthful evidence fragments distributed through public channels, without relying on covert communications, backdoors, or falsified documents. By exploiting LLMs' overthinking tendency, we formalize the first cognitive collusion attack and propose Generative Montage: a Writer-Editor-Director framework that constructs deceptive narratives through adversarial debate and coordinated posting of evidence fragments, causing victims to internalize and propagate fabricated conclusions. To study this risk, we develop CoPHEME, a dataset derived from real-world rumor events, and simulate attacks across diverse LLM families. Our results show pervasive vulnerability across 14 LLM families: attack success rates reach 74.4% for proprietary models and 70.6% for open-weights models. Counterintuitively, stronger reasoning capabilities increase susceptibility, with reasoning-specialized models showing higher attack success than base models or prompts. Furthermore, these false beliefs then cascade to downstream judges, achieving over 60% deception rates, highlighting a socio-technical vulnerability in how LLM-based agents interact with dynamic information environments. Our implementation and data are available at: https://github.com/CharlesJW222/Lying_with_Truth/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Finite-State Decentralized Policy-Based Control With Guaranteed Ground Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a finite-state, decentralized decision and control framework for multi-agent ground coverage. The approach decomposes the problem into two coupled components: (i) the structural design of a deep neural network (DNN) induced by the reference configuration of the agents, and (ii) policy-based decentralized coverage control. Agents are classified as anchors and followers, yielding a generic and scalable communication architecture in which each follower interacts with exactly three in-neighbors from the preceding layer, forming an enclosing triangular communication structure. The DNN training weights implicitly encode the spatial configuration of the agent team, thereby providing a geometric representation of the environmental target set. Within this architecture, we formulate a computationally efficient decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) whose components are time-invariant except for a time-varying cost function defined by the deviation from the centroid of the target set contained within each agent communication triangle. By introducing the concept of Anyway Output Controllability (AOC), we assume each agent is AOC and establish decentralized convergence to a desired configuration that optimally represents the environmental target.</description>

      <title>{\mu}ACP: A Formal Calculus for Expressive, Resource-Constrained Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent communication remains a foundational problem in multi-agent systems: protocols such as FIPA-ACL guarantee semantic richness but are intractable for constrained environments, while lightweight IoT protocols achieve efficiency at the expense of expressiveness. This paper presents $\mu$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \textit{\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $\mu$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>CEE: An Inference-Time Jailbreak Defense for Embodied Intelligence via Subspace Concept Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for task understanding and action planning in embodied intelligence (EI) systems, but their adoption substantially increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. While recent work explores inference-time defenses, existing methods rely on static interventions on intermediate representations, which often degrade generation quality and impair adherence to task instructions, reducing system usability in EI settings. We propose a dynamic defense framework. For each EI inference request, we dynamically construct a task-specific safety-semantic subspace, project its hidden state to the most relevant direction, and apply SLERP rotation for adaptive safety control. At comparable defense success rates, our method preserves generation quality, improves usability, reduces tuning cost, and strengthens robustness in EI scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Memory Segment System for Generating High-Quality Long-Term Memory Content in Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current field of agent memory, extensive explorations have been conducted in the area of memory retrieval, yet few studies have focused on exploring the memory content. Most research simply stores summarized versions of historical dialogues, as exemplified by methods like A-MEM and MemoryBank. However, when humans form long-term memories, the process involves multi-dimensional and multi-component generation, rather than merely creating simple summaries. The low-quality memory content generated by existing methods can adversely affect recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multi-memory segment system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory segments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these segments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. We conducted experiments on the LoCoMo dataset and further performed ablation experiments, experiments on the robustness regarding the number of input memories, and overhead experiments, which demonstrated the effectiveness and practical value of our method.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a finance &amp; accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 16.8 minutes per workflow yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.</description>
