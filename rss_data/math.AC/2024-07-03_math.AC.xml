      <title>Jets and principal components of monomial ideals, and very well-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by using combinatorics to study jets of monomial ideals, we extend a definition of jets from graphs to clutters. We offer some structural results on their vertex covers, and show an interesting connection between the cover ideal of the jets of a clutter and the symbolic powers of the cover ideal of the original clutter. We use this connection to prove that jets of very well-covered graphs are very well-covered. Next, we turn our attention to principal jets of monomial ideals, describing their primary decomposition and minimal generating sets. Finally, we give formulas to compute various algebraic invariants of principal jets of monomial ideals, including their Hilbert series, Betti numbers, multiplicity and regularity.</description>

      <title>An ADE correspondence for grade three perfect ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of "higher structure maps" from generic rings for free resolutions of length three, we give a classification of grade 3 perfect ideals with small type and deviation in local rings of equicharacteristic zero, extending the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud structure theorem on Gorenstein ideals and realizing it as the type D case of an ADE correspondence. We also deduce restrictions on Betti tables in the graded setting for such ideals.</description>

      <title>Finite sets of points in $\mathbb{P}^4$ with special projection properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we introduce the notion of $(b,d)$-geprofi sets and study their basic properties. These are sets of $bd$ points in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose projection from a general point to a hyperplane is a full intersection, i.e., the intersection of a curve of degree $b$ and a surface of degree $d$. We show that such nontrivial sets exist if and only if $b\geq 4$ and $d\geq 2$. Somewhat surprisingly, for infinitely many values of $b$ and $d$ there exist such sets in linear general position. The note contains open questions and problems.</description>

      <title>Using matrix sparsification to solve tropical linear vector equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear vector equation in two unknown vectors is examined in the framework of tropical algebra dealing with the theory and applications of semirings and semifields with idempotent addition. We consider a two-sided equation where each side is a tropical product of a given matrix by one of the unknown vectors. We use a matrix sparsification technique to reduce the equation to a set of vector inequalities that involve row-monomial matrices obtained from the given matrices. An existence condition of solutions for the inequalities is established, and a direct representation of the solutions is derived in a compact vector form. To illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the obtained result with that of an existing solution procedure, we apply our solution technique to handle two-sided equations known in the literature. Finally, a computational scheme based on the approach to derive all solutions of the two-sided equation is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretic View of Unlabeled Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is the problem of solving a linear system of equations, where the right-hand-side vector is known only up to a permutation. In this work, we study fields of rational functions related to symmetric polynomials and their images under a linear projection of the variables; as a consequence, we establish that the solution to an n-dimensional unlabeled sensing problem with generic data can be obtained as the unique solution to a system of n + 1 polynomial equations of degrees 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 in n unknowns. Besides the new theoretical insights, this development offers the potential for scaling up algebraic unlabeled sensing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Polar multiplicities and integral dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new criteria for the integrality and birationality of an extension of graded algebras in terms of the general notion of polar multiplicities of Kleiman and Thorup. As an application, we obtain a new criterion for when a module is a reduction of another in terms of certain mixed Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicities. Furthermore, we prove several technical results regarding polar multiplicities.</description>
