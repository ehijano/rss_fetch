      <title>Generative Models with ELBOs Converging to Entropy Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is one of the most central objectives for probabilistic unsupervised learning. For the ELBOs of several generative models and model classes, we here prove convergence to entropy sums. As one result, we provide a list of generative models for which entropy convergence has been shown, so far, along with the corresponding expressions for entropy sums. Our considerations include very prominent generative models such as probabilistic PCA, sigmoid belief nets or Gaussian mixture models. However, we treat more models and entire model classes such as general mixtures of exponential family distributions. Our main contributions are the proofs for the individual models. For each given model we show that the conditions stated in Theorem 1 or Theorem 2 of [arXiv:2209.03077] are fulfilled such that by virtue of the theorems the given model's ELBO is equal to an entropy sum at all stationary points. The equality of the ELBO at stationary points applies under realistic conditions: for finite numbers of data points, for model/data mismatches, at any stationary point including saddle points etc, and it applies for any well behaved family of variational distributions.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of noisy Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely-used acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven success in applications for decades, important open questions remain on the theoretical convergence behaviors and rates for EI. In this paper, we contribute to the convergence theories of EI in three novel and critical area. First, we consider objective functions that are under the Gaussian process (GP) prior assumption, whereas existing works mostly focus on functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Second, we establish the first asymptotic error bound and its corresponding rate for GP-EI with noisy observations under the GP prior assumption. Third, by investigating the exploration and exploitation of the non-convex EI function, we prove improved error bounds for both the noise-free and noisy cases. The improved noiseless bound is extended to the RKHS assumption as well.</description>

      <title>Estimating shared subspace with AJIVE: the power and limitation of multiple data matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrative data analysis often requires disentangling joint and individual variations across multiple datasets, a challenge commonly addressed by the Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) model. While numerous methods have been developed to estimate the shared subspace under JIVE, the theoretical understanding of their performance remains limited, particularly in the context of multiple matrices and varying levels of subspace misalignment. This paper bridges this gap by providing a systematic analysis of shared subspace estimation in multi-matrix settings.
  We focus on the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) method, a two-stage spectral approach, and establish new performance guarantees that uncover its strengths and limitations. Specifically, we show that in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, AJIVE's estimation error decreases with the number of matrices, demonstrating the power of multi-matrix integration. Conversely, in low-SNR settings, AJIVE exhibits a non-diminishing error, highlighting fundamental limitations. To complement these results, we derive minimax lower bounds, showing that AJIVE achieves optimal rates in high-SNR regimes. Furthermore, we analyze an oracle-aided spectral estimator to demonstrate that the non-diminishing error in low-SNR scenarios is a fundamental barrier. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings, providing insights into the interplay between SNR, matrix count, and subspace misalignment.</description>

      <title>Predictions as Surrogates: Revisiting Surrogate Outcomes in the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a formal connection between the decades-old surrogate outcome model in biostatistics and economics and the emerging field of prediction-powered inference (PPI). The connection treats predictions from pre-trained models, prevalent in the age of AI, as cost-effective surrogates for expensive outcomes. Building on the surrogate outcomes literature, we develop recalibrated prediction-powered inference, a more efficient approach to statistical inference than existing PPI proposals. Our method departs from the existing proposals by using flexible machine learning techniques to learn the optimal ``imputed loss'' through a step we call recalibration. Importantly, the method always improves upon the estimator that relies solely on the data with available true outcomes, even when the optimal imputed loss is estimated imperfectly, and it achieves the smallest asymptotic variance among PPI estimators if the estimate is consistent. Computationally, our optimization objective is convex whenever the loss function that defines the target parameter is convex. We further analyze the benefits of recalibration, both theoretically and numerically, in several common scenarios where machine learning predictions systematically deviate from the outcome of interest. We demonstrate significant gains in effective sample size over existing PPI proposals via three applications leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning/AI models.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Converges Linearly to Flatter Minima than Gradient Flow in Shallow Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gradient descent (GD) dynamics of a depth-2 linear neural network with a single input and output. We show that GD converges at an explicit linear rate to a global minimum of the training loss, even with a large stepsize -- about $2/\textrm{sharpness}$. It still converges for even larger stepsizes, but may do so very slowly. We also characterize the solution to which GD converges, which has lower norm and sharpness than the gradient flow solution. Our analysis reveals a trade off between the speed of convergence and the magnitude of implicit regularization. This sheds light on the benefits of training at the ``Edge of Stability'', which induces additional regularization by delaying convergence and may have implications for training more complex models.</description>

      <title>Absolute Risk Prediction for Cannabis Use Disorder Using Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Substance use disorders (SUDs) have emerged as a pressing public health crisis in the United States, with adolescent substance use often leading to SUDs in adulthood. Effective strategies are needed to prevent this progression. To help in filling this need, we develop a novel and the first-ever absolute risk prediction model for cannabis use disorder (CUD) for adolescent or young adult cannabis users.
  Methods: We train a Bayesian machine learning model that provides a personalized CUD absolute risk for adolescent or young adult cannabis users using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Model performance is assessed using 5-fold cross-validation (CV) with area under the curve (AUC) and ratio of the expected to observed number of cases (E/O). External validation of the final model is conducted using two independent datasets.
  Results: The proposed model has five risk factors: biological sex, delinquency, and scores on personality traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. For predicting CUD risk within five years of first cannabis use, AUC and E/O, computed via 5-fold CV, were 0.68 and 0.95, respectively. For the same type of prediction in external validation, AUC values were 0.64 and 0.75, with E/O values of 0.98 and 1, indicating good discrimination and calibration performances of the model.
  Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed model is the first absolute risk prediction model for an SUD. It can aid clinicians in identifying adolescent/youth substance users at a high risk of developing CUD in future for clinically appropriate interventions.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Extrapolation: a Causal Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical work handling distribution shifts typically necessitates an entire target distribution that lands inside the training distribution. However, practical scenarios often involve only a handful of target samples, potentially lying outside the training support, which requires the capability of extrapolation. In this work, we aim to provide a theoretical understanding of when extrapolation is possible and offer principled methods to achieve it without requiring an on-support target distribution. To this end, we formulate the extrapolation problem with a latent-variable model that embodies the minimal change principle in causal mechanisms. Under this formulation, we cast the extrapolation problem into a latent-variable identification problem. We provide realistic conditions on shift properties and the estimation objectives that lead to identification even when only one off-support target sample is available, tackling the most challenging scenarios. Our theory reveals the intricate interplay between the underlying manifold's smoothness and the shift properties. We showcase how our theoretical results inform the design of practical adaptation algorithms. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we validate our theoretical findings and their practical implications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Law-Based Transformation (ALT): A Lightweight Feature Representation for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is fundamental in numerous domains, including finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. However, traditional TSC methods often struggle with the inherent complexity and variability of time series data. Building on our previous work with the linear law-based transformation (LLT) - which improved classification accuracy by transforming the feature space based on key data patterns - we introduce adaptive law-based transformation (ALT). ALT enhances LLT by incorporating variable-length shifted time windows, enabling it to capture distinguishing patterns of various lengths and thereby handle complex time series more effectively. By mapping features into a linearly separable space, ALT provides a fast, robust, and transparent solution that achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a few hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Estimating Task-based Performance Bounds for Accelerated MRI Image Reconstruction Methods by Use of Learned-Ideal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by the use of objective measures of image quality (IQ). The performance of the ideal observer (IO) acting on imaging measurements has long been advocated as a figure-of-merit to guide the optimization of imaging systems. For computed imaging systems, the performance of the IO acting on imaging measurements also sets an upper bound on task-performance that no image reconstruction method can transcend. As such, estimation of IO performance can provide valuable guidance when designing under-sampled data-acquisition techniques by enabling the identification of designs that will not permit the reconstruction of diagnostically inappropriate images for a specified task - no matter how advanced the reconstruction method is or how plausible the reconstructed images appear. The need for such analysis is urgent because of the substantial increase of medical device submissions on deep learning-based image reconstruction methods and the fact that they may produce clean images disguising the potential loss of diagnostic information when data is aggressively under-sampled. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) approximated IOs (CNN-IOs) was investigated for estimating the performance of data space IOs to establish task-based performance bounds for image reconstruction, under an X-ray computed tomographic (CT) context. In this work, the application of such data space CNN-IO analysis to multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems has been explored. This study utilized stylized multi-coil sensitivity encoding (SENSE) MRI systems and deep-generated stochastic brain models to demonstrate the approach. Signal-known-statistically and background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) binary signal detection tasks were selected to study the impact of different acceleration factors on the data space IO performance.</description>

      <title>Identifying Information from Observations with Uncertainty and Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning tasks from observations must encounter and process uncertainty and novelty, especially when it is expected to maintain performance when observing new information and to choose the best fitting hypothesis to the currently observed information. In this context, some key questions arise: what is information, how much information did the observations provide, how much information is required to identify the data-generating process, how many observations remain to get that information, and how does a predictor determine that it has observed novel information? This paper strengthens existing answers to these questions by formalizing the notion of "identifiable information" that arises from the language used to express the relationship between distinct states. Model identifiability and sample complexity are defined via computation of an indicator function over a set of hypotheses. Their properties and asymptotic statistics are described for data-generating processes ranging from deterministic processes to ergodic stationary stochastic processes. This connects the notion of identifying information in finite steps with asymptotic statistics and PAC-learning. The indicator function's computation naturally formalizes novel information and its identification from observations with respect to a hypothesis set. We also proved that computable PAC-Bayes learners' sample complexity distribution is determined by its moments in terms of the the prior probability distribution over a fixed finite hypothesis set.</description>

      <title>Rational Tuning of LLM Cascades via Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the functional-analytic framework of operator-valued kernels and un-truncated signature kernels, we propose a scalable, provably convergent signature-based algorithm for a broad class of high-dimensional, path-dependent hedging problems. We make minimal assumptions about market dynamics by modelling them as general geometric rough paths, yielding a fully model-free approach. Furthermore, through a representer theorem, we provide theoretical guarantees on the existence and uniqueness of a global minimum for the resulting optimization problem and derive an analytic solution under highly general loss functions. Similar to the popular deep hedging approach, but in a more rigorous fashion, our method can also incorporate additional features via the underlying operator-valued kernel, such as trading signals, news analytics, and past hedging decisions, closely aligning with true machine-learning practice.</description>

      <title>Reward-Guided Controlled Generation for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models: Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on inference-time guidance and alignment methods for optimizing downstream reward functions in diffusion models. While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling capabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require sample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in proteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models can be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial explores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review these methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques -- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling, and classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes (a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value functions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states to terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms not yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning methods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms based on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received limited attention in current research, and (3) connections between inference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.

      <title>A Near-optimal Algorithm for Learning Margin Halfspaces with Massart Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. Without computational considerations, the sample complexity of this learning problem is known to be $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon))$. Prior computationally efficient algorithms for the problem incur sample complexity $\tilde{O}(1/(\gamma^4 \epsilon^3))$ and achieve 0-1 error of $\eta+\epsilon$, where $\eta&lt;1/2$ is the upper bound on the noise rate. Recent work gave evidence of an information-computation tradeoff, suggesting that a quadratic dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is required for computationally efficient algorithms. Our main result is a computationally efficient learner with sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon^2))$, nearly matching this lower bound. In addition, our algorithm is simple and practical, relying on online SGD on a carefully selected sequence of convex losses.</description>

Abstract: We define an evolving in-time Bayesian neural network called a Hidden Markov Neural Network, which addresses the crucial challenge in time-series forecasting and continual learning: striking a balance between adapting to new data and appropriately forgetting outdated information. This is achieved by modelling the weights of a neural network as the hidden states of a Hidden Markov model, with the observed process defined by the available data. A filtering algorithm is employed to learn a variational approximation of the evolving-in-time posterior distribution over the weights. By leveraging a sequential variant of Bayes by Backprop, enriched with a stronger regularization technique called variational DropConnect, Hidden Markov Neural Networks achieve robust regularization and scalable inference. Experiments on MNIST, dynamic classification tasks, and next-frame forecasting in videos demonstrate that Hidden Markov Neural Networks provide strong predictive performance while enabling effective uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>An efficient likelihood-free Bayesian inference method based on sequential neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques have been recently proposed for dealing with simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. Unlike approximate Bayesian computation, SNPE techniques learn the posterior from sequential simulation using neural network-based conditional density estimators by minimizing a specific loss function. The SNPE method proposed by Lueckmann et al. (2017) used a calibration kernel to boost the sample weights around the observed data, resulting in a concentrated loss function. However, the use of calibration kernels may increase the variances of both the empirical loss and its gradient, making the training inefficient. To improve the stability of SNPE, this paper proposes to use an adaptive calibration kernel and several variance reduction techniques. The proposed method greatly speeds up the process of training and provides a better approximation of the posterior than the original SNPE method and some existing competitors as confirmed by numerical experiments. We also managed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for a high-dimensional model with a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonly used $f$-divergences of measures, e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are subject to limitations regarding the support of the involved measures. A remedy is regularizing the $f$-divergence by a squared maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) associated with a characteristic kernel $K$. We use the kernel mean embedding to show that this regularization can be rewritten as the Moreau envelope of some function on the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then, we exploit well-known results on Moreau envelopes in Hilbert spaces to analyze the MMD-regularized $f$-divergences, particularly their gradients. Subsequently, we use our findings to analyze Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD-regularized $f$-divergences. We provide proof-of-the-concept numerical examples for flows starting from empirical measures. Here, we cover $f$-divergences with infinite and finite recession constants. Lastly, we extend our results to the tight variational formulation of $f$-divergences and numerically compare the resulting flows.</description>

      <title>Statistical Efficiency of Distributional Temporal Difference Learning and Freedman's Inequality in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved empirical success in various domains. One core task in DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$. Distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, which extends the classic temporal difference learning (TD) in RL. In this paper, we focus on the non-asymptotic statistical rates of distributional TD. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose non-parametric distributional TD (NTD). For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, we show that for NTD with a generative model, we need $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\mu_{\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-3})$ interactions with the environment to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $1$-Wasserstein. This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. In addition, we revisit categorical distributional TD (CTD), showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance. We also extend our analysis to the more general setting where the data generating process is Markovian. In the Markovian setting, we propose variance-reduced variants of NTD and CTD, and show that both can achieve a $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \mu_{\pi,\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-3}+t_{mix}\mu_{\pi,\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-1})$ sample complexity bounds in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance, which matches the state-of-the-art statistical results for classic policy evaluation. To achieve the sharp statistical rates, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces. This new Freedman's inequality would be of independent interest for statistical analysis of various infinite-dimensional online learning problems.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Local Anti-Concentration Class: Logarithmic Regret for Greedy Linear Contextual Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance guarantees of exploration-free greedy algorithms for the linear contextual bandit problem. We introduce a novel condition, named the \textit{Local Anti-Concentration} (LAC) condition, which enables a greedy bandit algorithm to achieve provable efficiency. We show that the LAC condition is satisfied by a broad class of distributions, including Gaussian, exponential, uniform, Cauchy, and Student's~$t$ distributions, along with other exponential family distributions and their truncated variants. This significantly expands the class of distributions under which greedy algorithms can perform efficiently. Under our proposed LAC condition, we prove that the cumulative expected regret of the greedy algorithm for the linear contextual bandit is bounded by $O(\operatorname{poly} \log T)$. Our results establish the widest range of distributions known to date that allow a sublinear regret bound for greedy algorithms, further achieving a sharp poly-logarithmic regret.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a local surrogate approach for explainable time-series forecasting. An initially non-interpretable predictive model to improve the forecast of a classical time-series 'base model' is used. 'Explainability' of the correction is provided by fitting the base model again to the data from which the error prediction is removed (subtracted), yielding a difference in the model parameters which can be interpreted. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the potential of the method to discover and explain underlying patterns in the data.</description>

      <title>Simplified and Generalized Masked Diffusion for Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked (or absorbing) diffusion is actively explored as an alternative to autoregressive models for generative modeling of discrete data. However, existing work in this area has been hindered by unnecessarily complex model formulations and unclear relationships between different perspectives, leading to suboptimal parameterization, training objectives, and ad hoc adjustments to counteract these issues. In this work, we aim to provide a simple and general framework that unlocks the full potential of masked diffusion models. We show that the continuous-time variational objective of masked diffusion models is a simple weighted integral of cross-entropy losses. Our framework also enables training generalized masked diffusion models with state-dependent masking schedules. When evaluated by perplexity, our models trained on OpenWebText surpass prior diffusion language models at GPT-2 scale and demonstrate superior performance on 4 out of 5 zero-shot language modeling tasks. Furthermore, our models vastly outperform previous discrete diffusion models on pixel-level image modeling, achieving 2.75 (CIFAR-10) and 3.40 (ImageNet 64x64) bits per dimension that are better than autoregressive models of similar sizes.

      <title>Cost-aware Bayesian Optimization via the Pandora's Box Gittins Index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a technique for efficiently optimizing unknown functions in a black-box manner. To handle practical settings where gathering data requires use of finite resources, it is desirable to explicitly incorporate function evaluation costs into Bayesian optimization policies. To understand how to do so, we develop a previously-unexplored connection between cost-aware Bayesian optimization and the Pandora's Box problem, a decision problem from economics. The Pandora's Box problem admits a Bayesian-optimal solution based on an expression called the Gittins index, which can be reinterpreted as an acquisition function. We study the use of this acquisition function for cost-aware Bayesian optimization, and demonstrate empirically that it performs well, particularly in medium-high dimensions. We further show that this performance carries over to classical Bayesian optimization without explicit evaluation costs. Our work constitutes a first step towards integrating techniques from Gittins index theory into Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Improving the Finite Sample Estimation of Average Treatment Effects using Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Propensity Score Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, machine learning techniques have gained popularity for estimating causal effects. One machine learning approach that can be used for estimating an average treatment effect is Double/debiased machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al., 2018). This approach uses a double-robust score function that relies on the prediction of nuisance functions, such as the propensity score, which is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on covariates. Estimators relying on double-robust score functions are highly sensitive to errors in propensity score predictions. Machine learners increase the severity of this problem as they tend to over- or underestimate these probabilities. Several calibration approaches have been proposed to improve probabilistic forecasts of machine learners. This paper investigates the use of probability calibration approaches within the DML framework. Simulation results demonstrate that calibrating propensity scores may significantly reduces the root mean squared error of DML estimates of the average treatment effect in finite samples. We showcase it in an empirical example and provide conditions under which calibration does not alter the asymptotic properties of the DML estimator.</description>

      <title>Efficient PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Constant Malicious Noise Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding noise tolerance of machine learning algorithms is a central quest in learning theory. In this work, we study the problem of computationally efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in the presence of malicious noise, where an adversary can corrupt both instances and labels of training samples. The best-known noise tolerance either depends on a target error rate under distributional assumptions or on a margin parameter under large-margin conditions. In this work, we show that when both types of conditions are satisfied, it is possible to achieve constant noise tolerance by minimizing a reweighted hinge loss. Our key ingredients include: 1) an efficient algorithm that finds weights to control the gradient deterioration from corrupted samples, and 2) a new analysis on the robustness of the hinge loss equipped with such weights.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Graph Interplay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has emerged as a compelling framework for extracting informative representations from graph-structured data without extensive reliance on labeled inputs. In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method of synthetic controls is widely used for evaluating causal effects of policy changes in settings with observational data. Often, researchers aim to estimate the causal impact of policy interventions on a treated unit at an aggregate level while also possessing data at a finer granularity. In this article, we introduce the new disco command, which implements the Distributional Synthetic Controls method introduced in Gunsilius (2023). This command allows researchers to construct entire synthetic distributions for the treated unit based on an optimally weighted average of the distributions of the control units. Several aggregation schemes are provided to facilitate clear reporting of the distributional effects of the treatment. The package offers both quantile-based and CDF-based approaches, comprehensive inference procedures via bootstrap and permutation methods, and visualization capabilities. We empirically illustrate the use of the package by replicating the results in Van Dijcke et al. (2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflicting objectives present a considerable challenge in interleaving multi-task learning, necessitating the need for meticulous design and balance to ensure effective learning of a representative latent data space across all tasks without mutual negative impact. Drawing inspiration from the concept of marginal and conditional probability distributions in probability theory, we design a principled and well-founded approach to disentangle the original input into marginal and conditional probability distributions in the latent space of a variational autoencoder. Our proposed model, Deep Disentangled Interleaving Variational Encoding (DeepDIVE) learns disentangled features from the original input to form clusters in the embedding space and unifies these features via the cross-attention mechanism in the fusion stage. We theoretically prove that combining the objectives for reconstruction and forecasting fully captures the lower bound and mathematically derive a loss function for disentanglement using Na\"ive Bayes. Under the assumption that the prior is a mixture of log-concave distributions, we also establish that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior is upper bounded by a function minimized by the minimizer of the cross entropy loss, informing our adoption of radial basis functions (RBF) and cross entropy with interleaving training for DeepDIVE to provide a justified basis for convergence. Experiments on two public datasets show that DeepDIVE disentangles the original input and yields forecast accuracies better than the original VAE and comparable to existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
