      <title>Formalization of the Filter Extension Principle (FEP) in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Filter Extension Principle (FEP) asserts that every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, which plays a crucial role in the quest for non-principal ultrafilters. Non-principal ultrafilters find widespread applications in logic, set theory, topology, model theory, and especially non-standard extensions of algebraic structures. Since non-principal ultrafilters are challenging to construct directly, the Filter Extension Principle, stemming from the Axiom of Choice, holds significant value in obtaining them. This paper presents the formal verification of the Filter Extension Principle, implemented using the Coq proof assistant and grounded in axiomatic set theory. It offers formal descriptions for the concepts related to filter base, filter, ultrafilter and more. All relevant theorems, propositions, and the Filter Extension Principle itself are rigorously and formally verified. This work sets the stage for the formalization of non-standard analysis and a specific real number theory.</description>

      <title>Clones of Borel Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lattice of all Borel clones on $2 = \{0,1\}$: classes of Borel functions $f : 2^n \to 2$, $n \le \omega$, which are closed under composition and include all projections. This is a natural extension to countable arities of Post's 1941 classification of all clones of finitary Boolean functions. Every Borel clone restricts to a finitary clone, yielding a "projection" from the lattice of all Borel clones to Post's lattice. It is well-known that each finitary clone of affine mod 2 functions admits a unique extension to a Borel clone. We show that over each finitary clone containing either both $\wedge, \vee$, or the 2-out-of-3 median operation, there lie at least 2 but only finitely many Borel clones. Over the remaining clones in Post's lattice, we give only a partial classification of the Borel extensions, and present some evidence that the full structure may be quite complicated.</description>

      <title>Scott Complexity of Reduced Abelian $p$-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reduced abelian $p$-group, we give an upper bound on the Scott complexity of the group in terms of its Ulm invariants. For limit ordinals, we show that this upper bound is tight. This gives an explicit sequence of such groups with arbitrarily high Scott complexity below $\omega_1$. Along the way, we give a largely algebraic characterization of the back-and-forth relations on reduced abelian $p$-groups, making progress on an open problem from the book by Ash and Knight.</description>

      <title>Guarded Successor: A Novel Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GS (Guarded Successor), a novel decidable temporal logic with several unique distinctive features. Among those, it allows infinitely many data values that come not only with equality but with a somehow rich theory too: the first-order theory of atomless Boolean algebras. The language also distinguishes between inputs and outputs, and has a decision procedure for determining whether for all inputs exist outputs, at each point of time. Moreover, and maybe most surprisingly, the data values can be nothing but sentences in GS itself. We also present a non-temporal fragment called NSO (Nullary Second Order) that enjoys merely this last property. These results are crucial necessary ingredients in any meaningful design of safe AI. Finally, all those results are obtained from a novel treatment of the first-order theory of atomless Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations I: Directed complete posets and Scott's $D_\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop domain theory in constructive and predicative univalent foundations (also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations II: Continuous and algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>The surjection property and computable type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of two properties of spaces and pairs of spaces, the surjection property and the epsilon-surjection property, that were recently introduced to characterize the notion of computable type arising from computability theory. For a class of spaces including the finite simplicial complexes, we develop techniques to prove or disprove these properties using homotopy and homology theories, and give applications of these results. In particular, we answer an open question on the computable type property, showing that it is not preserved by taking products. We also observe that computable type is decidable for finite simplicial complexes.</description>
