      <title>Gravitational Waves from a Gauge Field Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Lensing Inference II: Cluster Lensing with $\mathcal{O}$(1) Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of a cluster lensing signal with `Kinematic Lensing' (KL), a novel weak lensing method that combines photometry, spectroscopy, and the Tully-Fisher relation to enable shear measurements with individual source galaxies. This is the second paper in a two-part series aimed at measuring a KL signal from data. The first paper, arXiv:2209.11811, describes the inference pipeline, which jointly forward models galaxy imaging and spectroscopy, and demonstrates unbiased shear inference with simulated data. This paper presents measurements of the lensing signal from the galaxy cluster Abell 2261. We obtain spectroscopic observations of background disk galaxies in the cluster field selected from the CLASH Subaru catalog. The final sample consists of three source galaxies while the remaining are rejected due to insufficient signal-to-noise, spectroscopic failures, and inadequately sampled rotation curves. We apply the KL inference pipeline to the three sources and find the shear estimates to be in broad agreement with traditional weak lensing measurements. The typical shear measurement uncertainty for our sources is $\sigma(g_+)\approx 0.026$, which represents approximately a ten-fold improvement over the weak lensing shape noise. We identify target selection and observing strategy as the key avenues of improvement for future KL programs.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: 2.1% measurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale from the final dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present the angular diameter distance measurement obtained from the measurement of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature using the completed Dark Energy Survey (DES) data, summarizing the main results of [Phys. Rev. D 110, 063514] and [Phys. Rev. D 110, 063515]. We use a galaxy sample optimized for BAO science in the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, with an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}$ = 0.85. Our consensus measurement constrains the ratio of the angular distance to the sound horizon scale to $D_M(z_{\rm eff})/r_d$ = 19.51 $\pm$ 0.41. This measurement is found to be 2.13$\sigma$ below the angular BAO scale predicted by Planck. To date, it represents the most precise measurement from purely photometric data, and the most precise from any Stage-III experiment at such high redshift. The analysis was performed blinded to the BAO position and is shown to be robust against analysis choices, data removal, redshift calibrations and observational systematics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity from the BOSS Full-Shape and DESI BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain dark energy and modified gravity within the effective field theory of dark energy framework using the full-shape BOSS galaxy power spectrum, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and recent baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from DESI. Specifically, we focus on a varying braiding parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$, a running of the ``effective'' Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$, and a constant dark energy equation of state $w$. The analysis is performed with two of these parameters at a time, including all the other standard cosmological parameters and marginalizing over bias and nuisance parameters. The full-shape galaxy power spectrum is modeled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We find that the CMB data is most sensitive to $\alpha_{\rm B}$, and that adding large-scale structure information only slightly changes the parameter constraints. However, the large-scale structure data significantly improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences. This is likely to change with future high-precision full-shape data from Euclid and DESI however, to which the pipeline developed here is immediately applicable.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation II: The Inflationary Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contribution of large scalar perturbations sourced by a sharp feature during cosmic inflation to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), extending our previous work to include the SGWB sourced during the inflationary era. We focus in particular on three-field inflation, since the third dynamical field is the first not privileged by the perturbations' equations of motion and allows a more direct generalization to $N$-field inflation. For the first time, we study the three-field isocurvature perturbations sourced during the feature and include the effects of isocurvature masses. In addition to a two-field limit, we find that the third field's dynamics during the feature can source large isocurvature transients which then later decay, leaving an inflationary-era-sourced SGWB as their only observable signature. We find that the inflationary-era signal shape near the peak is largely independent of the number of dynamical fields and has a greatly enhanced amplitude sourced by the large isocurvature transient, suppressing the radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter space with small adiabatic enhancement. The largest enhancements we study could easily violate backreaction constraints, but much of parameter space remains under perturbative control. These SGWBs could be visible in LISA and other gravitational wave experiments, leaving an almost universal signature of sharp features during multi-field inflation, even when the sourcing isocurvature decays to unobservability shortly afterwards.</description>

      <title>Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study with Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$ and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE} \lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A measurement of the escaping ionising efficiency of galaxies at redshift 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escaping ionising efficiency from galaxies, $f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}$, is a crucial ingredient for understanding their contribution to hydrogen reionisation, but both of its components, $f_{\rm{esc}}$ and $\xi_{\rm{ion}}$, are extremely difficult to measure. We measure the average escaping ionising efficiency $\langle f_{\rm{esc}} \xi_{\rm{ion}}\rangle$ of galaxies at $z=5$ implied by the mean level of ionisation in the intergalactic medium via the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We use the fact that $\dot{N}_{\rm{ion}} = \rho_{\rm{UV}} f_{\rm{esc}} \xi_{\rm{ion}}$, the product of the ionising output and the UV density $\rho_{\rm{UV}}$, can be calculated from the known average strength of the UV background and the mean free path of ionising photons. These quantities, as well as $\rho_{\rm{UV}}$, are robustly measured at $z\leq6$. We calculate the missing factor of $\langle f_{\rm{esc}} \xi_{\rm{ion}}\rangle$ at $z=5$, during a convenient epoch after hydrogen reionisation has completed and the intergalactic medium has reached ionisation equilibrium, but before bright quasars begin to dominate the ionising photon production. Intuitively, our constraint corresponds to the required escaping ionising production from galaxies in order to avoid over- or under-ionising the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We obtain a measurement of $\log \langle f_{\rm{esc}} \xi_{\rm{ion}}\rangle /$erg Hz$^{-1}$ $ = 24.28_{-0.20}^{+0.21}$ at $z=5$ when integrating $\rho_\text{UV}$ down to a limiting magnitude $M_\text{lim}=-11$. Our measurement of the escaping ionising efficiency of galaxies is in rough agreement with both observations and most models.</description>

      <title>Illuminating dark objects with dark matter lampshades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new technique to search for dark compact objects. When dark matter comprising a dark compact object interacts with photons, the compact object can disperse light traveling though it. As these objects pass between the Earth and a distant star, they act as "lampshades" that dim the star. We examine how dimming effects from clumps of dark matter in the galaxy could be searched for in microlensing surveys, which measure the brightness of stars as a function of time. Using the EROS-2 and OGLE surveys, we show that a dimming analysis of existing data can be used to constrain dark sectors, and could be used to discover dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Gas-Rich Galaxies at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes ($&gt;10^6$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) beyond the redshift of $z=10$. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z $\gtrsim 10$). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range $10^8$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to $10^5$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in just $10^4$ years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Participatory Science and Machine Learning Applied to Millions of Sources in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are merging a large participatory science effort with machine learning to enhance the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Our overall goal is to remove false positives, allowing us to use lower signal-to-noise data and sources with low goodness-of-fit. With six million classifications through Dark Energy Explorers, we can confidently determine if a source is not real at over 94% confidence level when classified by at least ten individuals; this confidence level increases for higher signal-to-noise sources. To date, we have only been able to apply this direct analysis to 190,000 sources. The full sample of HETDEX will contain around 2-3M sources, including nearby galaxies ([O II] emitters), distant galaxies (Lyman-alpha emitters or LAEs), false positives, and contamination from instrument issues. We can accommodate this tenfold increase by using machine learning with visually-vetted samples from Dark Energy Explorers. We have already increased by over ten-fold in number of sources that have been visually vetted from our previous pilot study where we only had 14,000 visually vetted LAE candidates. This paper expands on the previous work increasing the visually-vetted sample from 14,000 to 190,000. In addition, using our currently visually-vetted sample, we generate a real or false positive classification for the full candidate sample of 1.2 million LAEs. We currently have approximately 17,000 volunteers from 159 countries around the world. Thus, we are applying participatory or citizen scientist analysis to our full HETDEX dataset, creating a free educational opportunity that requires no prior technical knowledge.</description>

      <title>NeutralUniverseMachine: How Filaments and Dark Matter Halo Influence the Galaxy Cold Gas Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the influence of distance to filaments and dark matter halos on galaxy cold gas content in the empirical model NeutralUniverseMachine (NUM) and the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG. Methods. We use DisPerSE to identify cosmic web structures and calculate the distance of galaxies to filaments for both observations and models. We show the results of the HI and H2 mass functions, HI- and H2-halo mass relations, HI- and H2-stellar mass relations for galaxies in the NUM model and IllustrisTNG with different distances to filaments and compare them with observational measurements. We also show the evolution of HI, H2 mass densities in different distance to filament bins. Results. We find that the role of filaments in affecting the HI gas is generally less significant compared to the halo environment. There is a weak trend in the observations at z = 0 that low-mass halos lying closer to filaments tend to have reduced HI masses. However, this trend reverses for massive halos with log(Mvir/Msun) &gt; 12.5. This behavior is accurately reproduced in the NUM model due to the dependence of HI gas on the halo formation time, but it does not appear in IllustrisTNG. The influence of filaments on the HI gas becomes slightly weaker at higher redshifts and is only significant for galaxies residing in massive halos in the NUM model. Filaments have almost no impact on the H2-stellar mass relation in both models, confirming that H2 is primarily determined by the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate.</description>

      <title>The Method of Searching for Rotations of the Polarization Position Angle of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of quasars show that the polarization position angle of the emission coming from them varies greatly over time, including periods called rotations during which the angle changes in an orderly manner. The study proposes a method for identifying such events and assessing their statistical significance. The operation of the method is demonstrated using the example of long-term polarimetric observations of the blazars CTA 102, 3C 454.3, and OT 081. During the analysis of light curves, 51 rotations of the polarization position angle were found and it was shown that for CTA 102 and 3C 454.3 the rotations are predominantly oriented in one direction.</description>

      <title>Chiral dark matter and radiative neutrino masses from gauged U(1) symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of dark matter models based on a chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry acting on a dark sector. The chiral $U(1)$ protects the masses of the dark sector fermions, and also guarantees the stability of the dark matter particle by virtue of an unbroken discrete $\mathcal{Z}_N$ gauge symmetry. We identify 38 such $U(1)$ models which are descendants of a chiral $SU(3) \times SU(2)$ gauge symmetry, consisting of a minimal set of fermions with simple $U(1)$ charge assignments. We show how these models can also be utilized to generate small Majorana neutrino masses radiatively via the scotogenic mechanism with the dark sector particles circulating inside loop diagrams. We further explore the phenomenology of the simplest model in this class, which admits a Majorana fermion, Dirac fermion or a scalar field to be the dark matter candidate, and show the consistency of various scenarios with constraints from relic density and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Distinguish dark matter theories with the cosmic web and next-generation surveys I: an alternative theory of gravity</title>

Abstract: In the context of future large surveys like the Euclid mission, extracting the cosmic web from galaxies at higher redshifts with more statistical power will become feasible, particularly within the group-cluster mass regime. Therefore, it is imperative to enlarge the number of metrics that can used to constrain our cosmological models at these large scales. The number of cosmic filaments surrounding galaxies, groups and clusters, namely the connectivity, has recently emerged as a compelling probe of the large-scale structures, and has been investigated in various observational and numerical analyses. In this first paper, we examine dark matter-only cosmological simulations using the widely used DisPerSE filament finder code under two theories of gravity: the Poisson ($\Lambda$CDM) and the Monge-Amp\`ere models, in order to quantify how alternative models of gravity alter the properties of the cosmic skeleton. We specifically focused on this alternative gravity theory due to its propensity to enhance the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments, but it also makes them more resistant to collapse, which consequently reduces the formation of halos. Indeed, our findings reveal that replacing the Poisson equation has a significant impact on the hierarchical formation scenario. This is evidenced by examining the redshift evolution of both the slope and the offset of the connectivity. Additionally, we demonstrated that current observations are generally in better agreement with our well-established gravity model. Finally, our study suggests that filament connectivity in the group-cluster regime could serve as a probe of our gravity model at cosmological scales. We also emphasize that our approach could be extended to alternative theories of dark matter, such as warm or fuzzy dark matter, given the extraordinary datasets provided by next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Developing a Theoretical Model for the Resummation of Infrared Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Power Spectrum (an explanatory video is available in the comments section)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06142</link>

Abstract: Since galaxy distribution reconstruction effectively reduces non-Gaussian terms in the power spectrum covariance matrix, it has attracted interest not only for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals but also for various cosmological signal analyses. To this end, this paper presents a novel theoretical model that addresses infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, including 1-loop corrections. In particular, we discuss the importance of incorporating non-perturbative effects arising from IR contributions into the displacement vector $\vec{s}$ used for reconstruction. Consequently, post-reconstruction nonlinear damping of BAO can be described by a single two-dimensional Gaussian function. This is a phenomenon not observed when $\vec{s}$ is considered to at a linear order in the Zel'dovich approximation. Furthermore, we confirm that the cross-power spectrum of the pre- and post-reconstruction density fluctuations lacks IR effect cancellations, and shows an exponential decay in both the cross-power spectrum and the associated shot-noise term.

      <title>Formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric so their interactions with other primordial black holes can significantly increase their coalescence times and thereby suppress the merger rate. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a relatively narrow mass distribution. When the primordial abundance is below 1%, encounters between primordial black holes are unlikely and their effect on the merger rate becomes negligible.</description>

      <title>ELG Spectroscopic Systematics Analysis of the DESI Data Release 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses more than 2.4 million Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) for 3D large-scale structure (LSS) analyses in its Data Release 1 (DR1). Such large statistics enable thorough research on systematic uncertainties. In this study, we focus on spectroscopic systematics of ELGs. The redshift success rate ($f_{\rm goodz}$) is the relative fraction of secure redshifts among all measurements. It depends on observing conditions, thus introduces non-cosmological variations to the LSS. We, therefore, develop the redshift failure weight ($w_{\rm zfail}$) and a per-fibre correction ($\eta_{\rm zfail}$) to mitigate these dependences. They have minor influences on the galaxy clustering. For ELGs with a secure redshift, there are two subtypes of systematics: 1) catastrophics (large) that only occur in a few samples; 2) redshift uncertainty (small) that exists for all samples. The catastrophics represent 0.26\% of the total DR1 ELGs, composed of the confusion between O\,\textsc{ii} and sky residuals, double objects, total catastrophics and others. We simulate the realistic 0.26\% catastrophics of DR1 ELGs, the hypothetical 1\% catastrophics, and the truncation of the contaminated $1.31&lt;z&lt;1.33$ in the \textsc{AbacusSummit} ELG mocks. Their $P_\ell$ show non-negligible bias from the uncontaminated mocks. But their influences on the redshift space distortions (RSD) parameters are smaller than $0.2\sigma$. The redshift uncertainty of \Yone ELGs is 8.5 km/s with a Lorentzian profile. The code for implementing the catastrophics and redshift uncertainty on mocks can be found in https://github.com/Jiaxi-Yu/modelling_spectro_sys.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Investigating Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report constraints on a variety of non-standard cosmological models using the full 5-year photometrically-classified type Ia supernova sample from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR). Both Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Suspiciousness calculations find no strong evidence for or against any of the non-standard models we explore. When combined with external probes, the AIC and Suspiciousness agree that 11 of the 15 models are moderately preferred over Flat-$\Lambda$CDM suggesting additional flexibility in our cosmological models may be required beyond the cosmological constant. We also provide a detailed discussion of all cosmological assumptions that appear in the DES supernova cosmology analyses, evaluate their impact, and provide guidance on using the DES Hubble diagram to test non-standard models. An approximate cosmological model, used to perform bias corrections to the data holds the biggest potential for harbouring cosmological assumptions. We show that even if the approximate cosmological model is constructed with a matter density shifted by $\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.2$ from the true matter density of a simulated data set the bias that arises is sub-dominant to statistical uncertainties. Nevertheless, we present and validate a methodology to reduce this bias.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

      <title>Forecast of strongly lensed supernovae rates in the China Space Station Telescope surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) are a powerful probe for cosmology and stellar physics. The relative time delays between lensed SN images provide an independent way of measuring a fundamental cosmological parameter -- the Hubble constant -- , the value of which is currently under debate. The time delays also serve as a ``time machine'', offering a unique opportunity to capture the extremely early phase of the SN explosion, which can be used to constrain the SN progenitor and explosion mechanism. Although there are only a handful of strongly lensed SN discoveries so far, which greatly hinders scientific applications, the sample size is expected to grow substantially with next-generation surveys. In this work, we investigate the capability of detecting strongly lensed SNe with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), a two-meter space telescope to be launched around 2026. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that CSST can detect 1008.53 and 51.78 strongly lensed SNe from its Wide Field Survey (WFS, covering 17,500 deg$^2$) and Deep Field Survey (DFS, covering 400 deg$^2$) over the course of ten years. In both surveys, about 35\% of the events involve Type Ia SNe as the background sources. Our results suggest that the WFS and DFS of CSST, although not designed or optimized for discovering transients, can still make a great contribution to the strongly lensed SNe studies.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole formation has been discussed widely, when density perturbations in the early universe cause matter to collapse gravitationally, giving rise to these ultra-compact objects. We propose that such a gravitational collapse also gives rise to primordial naked singularities, that would play an important role in the observable features of present universe. We consider two types of collapse scenarios that give rise to event-like and object-like visible singularities within a cosmological background. We briefly discuss implications of primordial naked singularities, including those for dark matter, vis-a-vis primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical simulations have shown that the unstable disk within the central regime of the primordial gas cloud fragments to form multiple protostars on several scales. Their evolution depends on the mass accretion phenomenon, interaction with the surrounding medium and radiative feedback respectively. In this work, we use a fast semi-analytical framework in order to model multiple protostars within a rotating cloud, where the mass accretion is estimated via a Bondi-Hoyle flow and the feedback process is approximated through radiation pressure. We observe that while some of the evolving protostars possibly grow massive ($\approx 1-75\ M_{\odot}$) via accretion and mergers, a fraction of them ($\approx 20\%$) are likely to be ejected from the parent cloud with a mass corresponding to $M_{*} \lesssim 0.8\ M_{\odot}$. These low-mass protostars may be considered as the potential candidates to enter the zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) phase and possibly survive till the present epoch.</description>

      <title>Supernova-Neutrino-Boosted Dark Matter from All Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that the boosted dark matter (BDM) by supernova neutrinos (SN$\nu$) from SN1987a or from the next Galactic supernova (SN) can serve as a novel component to probe nonvanishing interaction between dark matter (DM) and the standard model leptons [Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 130, 111002 (2023) and Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 083013 (2023)]. In this Letter, we extend this concept and evaluate the present-day diffuse flux of SN$\nu$ BDM originated from all galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that by considering this diffuse BDM (DBDM) component, the best sensitivity on the product of the energy-independent DM-$\nu$ and DM-electron cross sections, $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi\nu}\sigma_{\chi e}}\simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-37})$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV DM, can be obtained with large-size neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande or Hyper-Kamiokande, surpassing the estimated SN$\nu$ BDM bound from SN1987a. We also examine the impact due to the presence of DM spikes around the supermassive black holes in galaxies on SN$\nu$ BDM and DBDM. Our results suggest that both the DBDM and the SN$\nu$ BDM probes are robust to the uncertain properties of DM spikes, unless the next Galactic SN happens to occur at a location extremely close to or right behind the Galactic Center along the SN line of sight.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of space-based gravitational-wave detector networks, specifically Taiji and LISA, to measure the anisotropies in stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which are characterized by the angular power spectrum. We find that a detector network can improve the measurement precision of anisotropies by at most fourteen orders of magnitude, depending on the angular multipoles. By doing so, we can enhance our understanding of the physical origins of SGWB, both in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. We assess the prospects of the detector networks for measuring the parameters of angular power spectrum. We further find an inevitable effect of cosmic variance, which can be suppressed by a better angular resolution, strengthening the importance of configuring detector networks. Our findings also suggest a potential detection of the kinematic dipole due to Doppler boosting of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>
