      <title>Formal Verification of Neural Certificates Done Dynamically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified, serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the certificates.</description>

      <title>FactorHD: A Hyperdimensional Computing Model for Multi-Object Multi-Class Representation and Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.</description>
