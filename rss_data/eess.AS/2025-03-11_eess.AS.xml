      <title>ProSE: Diffusion Priors for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) is the foundational task of enhancing the clarity and quality of speech in the presence of non-stationary additive noise. While deterministic deep learning models have been commonly employed for SE, recent research indicates that generative models, such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown promise. However, unlike speech generation, SE has a strong constraint in generating results in accordance with the underlying ground-truth signal. Additionally, for a wide variety of applications, SE systems need to be employed in real-time, and traditional diffusion models (DMs) requiring many iterations of a large model during inference are inefficient. To address these issues, we propose ProSE (diffusion-based Priors for SE), a novel methodology based on an alternative framework for applying diffusion models to SE. Specifically, we first apply DDPMs to generate priors in a latent space due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities. The priors are then integrated into a transformer-based regression model for SE. The priors guide the regression model in the enhancement process. Since the diffusion process is applied to a compact latent space, the diffusion model takes fewer iterations than the traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations. Additionally, using a regression model for SE avoids the distortion issue caused by misaligned details generated by DMs. Our experiments show that ProSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with fewer computational costs.</description>

      <title>Why Pre-trained Models Fail: Feature Entanglement in Multi-modal Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression remains a pressing global mental health issue, driving considerable research into AI-driven detection approaches. While pre-trained models, particularly speech self-supervised models (SSL Models), have been applied to depression detection, they show unexpectedly poor performance without extensive data augmentation. Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success across various domains, have not been explored in multi-modal depression detection. In this paper, we first establish an LLM-based system to investigate its potential in this task, uncovering fundamental limitations in handling multi-modal information. Through systematic analysis, we discover that the poor performance of pre-trained models stems from the conflation of high-level information, where high-level features derived from both content and speech are mixed within pre-trained models model representations, making it challenging to establish effective decision boundaries. To address this, we propose an information separation framework that disentangles these features, significantly improving the performance of both SSL models and LLMs in depression detection. Our experiments validate this finding and demonstrate that the integration of separated features yields substantial improvements over existing approaches, providing new insights for developing more effective multi-modal depression detection systems.</description>

      <title>Score-informed Music Source Separation: Improving Synthetic-to-real Generalization in Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music source separation is the task of separating a mixture of instruments into constituent tracks. Music source separation models are typically trained using only audio data, although additional information can be used to improve the model's separation capability. In this paper, we propose two ways of using musical scores to aid music source separation: a score-informed model where the score is concatenated with the magnitude spectrogram of the audio mixture as the input of the model, and a model where we use only the score to calculate the separation mask. We train our models on synthetic data in the SynthSOD dataset and evaluate our methods on the URMP and Aalto anechoic orchestra datasets, comprised of real recordings. The score-informed model improves separation results compared to a baseline approach, but struggles to generalize from synthetic to real data, whereas the score-only model shows a clear improvement in synthetic-to-real generalization.</description>

      <title>Impact of Microphone Array Mismatches to Learning-based Replay Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalization of a multi-channel learning-based replay speech detector, which employs adaptive beamforming and detection, across different microphone arrays. In general, deep neural network-based microphone array processing techniques generalize poorly to unseen array types, i.e., showing a significant training-test mismatch of performance. We employ the ReMASC dataset to analyze performance degradation due to inter- and intra-device mismatches, assessing both single- and multi-channel configurations. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning to mitigate the performance loss when transitioning to unseen microphone arrays. Our findings reveal that array mismatches significantly decrease detection accuracy, with intra-device generalization being more robust than inter-device. However, fine-tuning with as little as ten minutes of target data can effectively recover performance, providing insights for practical deployment of replay detection systems in heterogeneous automatic speaker verification environments.</description>

      <title>Building English ASR model with regional language support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to developing an English Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that can effectively handle Hindi queries, without compromising its performance on English. We propose a novel acoustic model (AM), referred to as SplitHead with Attention (SHA) model, features shared hidden layers across languages and language-specific projection layers combined via a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism estimates the weight for each language based on input data and weighs the corresponding language-specific projection layers accordingly. Additionally, we propose a language modeling approach that interpolates n-gram models from both English and transliterated Hindi text corpora. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a 69.3% and 5.7% relative reduction in word error rate on Hindi and English test sets respectively when compared to a monolingual English model.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Audio-to-Image Encoding for Improved Voice Characteristic Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel audio-to-image encoding framework that integrates multiple dimensions of voice characteristics into a single RGB image for speaker recognition. In this method, the green channel encodes raw audio data, the red channel embeds statistical descriptors of the voice signal (including key metrics such as median and mean values for fundamental frequency, spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff, zero-crossing rate, MFCCs, RMS energy, spectral flatness, spectral contrast, chroma, and harmonic-to-noise ratio), and the blue channel comprises subframes representing these features in a spatially organized format. A deep convolutional neural network trained on these composite images achieves 98% accuracy in speaker classification across two speakers, suggesting that this integrated multi-channel representation can provide a more discriminative input for voice recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Training and Inference Efficiency of Encoder-Decoder Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention encoder-decoder model architecture is the backbone of several recent top performing foundation speech models: Whisper, Seamless, OWSM, and Canary-1B. However, the reported data and compute requirements for their training are prohibitive for many in the research community. In this work, we focus on the efficiency angle and ask the questions of whether we are training these speech models efficiently, and what can we do to improve? We argue that a major, if not the most severe, detrimental factor for training efficiency is related to the sampling strategy of sequential data. We show that negligence in mini-batch sampling leads to more than 50% computation being spent on padding. To that end, we study, profile, and optimize Canary-1B training to show gradual improvement in GPU utilization leading up to 5x increase in average batch sizes versus its original training settings. This in turn allows us to train an equivalent model using 4x less GPUs in the same wall time, or leverage the original resources and train it in 2x shorter wall time. Finally, we observe that the major inference bottleneck lies in the autoregressive decoder steps. We find that adjusting the model architecture to transfer model parameters from the decoder to the encoder results in a 3x inference speedup as measured by inverse real-time factor (RTFx) while preserving the accuracy and compute requirements for convergence. The training code and models will be available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Text-Speech Language Models with Improved Cross-Modal Transfer by Aligning Abstraction Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- aim to enable cross-modal knowledge transfer to overcome the scaling limitations of unimodal speech LMs. The predominant approach to TSLM training expands the vocabulary of a pre-trained text LM by appending new embeddings and linear projections for speech, followed by fine-tuning on speech data. We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.</description>

      <title>Zero-AVSR: Zero-Shot Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs by Learning Language-Agnostic Speech Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel zero-shot Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) framework, dubbed Zero-AVSR, which enables speech recognition in target languages without requiring any audio-visual speech data in those languages. Specifically, we introduce the Audio-Visual Speech Romanizer (AV-Romanizer), which learns language-agnostic speech representations by predicting Roman text. Then, by leveraging the strong multilingual modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose converting the predicted Roman text into language-specific graphemes, forming the proposed Cascaded Zero-AVSR. Taking it a step further, we explore a unified Zero-AVSR approach by directly integrating the audio-visual speech representations encoded by the AV-Romanizer into the LLM. This is achieved through finetuning the adapter and the LLM using our proposed multi-task learning scheme. To capture the wide spectrum of phonetic and linguistic diversity, we also introduce a Multilingual Audio-Visual Romanized Corpus (MARC) consisting of 2,916 hours of audio-visual speech data across 82 languages, along with transcriptions in both language-specific graphemes and Roman text. Extensive analysis and experiments confirm that the proposed Zero-AVSR framework has the potential to expand language support beyond the languages seen during the training of the AV-Romanizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative systems of musical accompaniments are rapidly growing, yet there are no standardized metrics to evaluate how well generations align with the conditional audio prompt. We introduce a distribution-based measure called "Accompaniment Prompt Adherence" (APA), and validate it through objective experiments on synthetic data perturbations, and human listening tests. Results show that APA aligns well with human judgments of adherence and is discriminative to transformations that degrade adherence. We release a Python implementation of the metric using the widely adopted pre-trained CLAP embedding model, offering a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing accompaniment generation systems.</description>

      <title>A Neural Score Follower for Computer Accompaniment of Polyphonic Musical Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time computer-based accompaniment for human musical performances entails three critical tasks: identifying what the performer is playing, locating their position within the score, and synchronously playing the accompanying parts. Among these, the second task (score following) has been addressed through methods such as dynamic programming on string sequences, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Online Time Warping (OLTW). Yet, the remarkably successful techniques of Deep Learning (DL) have not been directly applied to this problem.
  Therefore, we introduce HeurMiT, a novel DL-based score-following framework, utilizing a neural architecture designed to learn compressed latent representations that enables precise performer tracking despite deviations from the score. Parallelly, we implement a real-time MIDI data augmentation toolkit, aimed at enhancing the robustness of these learned representations. Additionally, we integrate the overall system with simple heuristic rules to create a comprehensive framework that can interface seamlessly with existing transcription and accompaniment technologies.
  However, thorough experimentation reveals that despite its impressive computational efficiency, HeurMiT's underlying limitations prevent it from being practical in real-world score following scenarios. Consequently, we present our work as an introductory exploration into the world of DL-based score followers, while highlighting some promising avenues to encourage future research towards robust, state-of-the-art neural score following systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages both audio and visual modalities to enhance speech recognition robustness, particularly in noisy environments. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, due to the significant length of speech representations, direct integration with LLMs imposes substantial computational costs. Prior approaches address this by compressing speech representations before feeding them into LLMs. However, higher compression ratios often lead to performance degradation, necessitating a trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which enables flexible adaptation of the audio-visual token allocation based on specific computational constraints while preserving high performance. Our approach, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, encodes audio-visual representations at multiple granularities within a single model, eliminating the need to train separate models for different compression levels. Moreover, to efficiently fine-tune the LLM, we introduce three LoRA-based Matryoshka strategies using global and scale-specific LoRA modules. Extensive evaluations on the two largest AVSR datasets demonstrate that Llama-MTSK achieves state-of-the-art results, matching or surpassing models trained independently at fixed compression levels.</description>

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis in Multi-Party Conversation Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis are pivotal tasks in speech and language processing, particularly in real-world scenarios involving multi-party, conversational data. This paper presents a multimodal approach to tackle these challenges on a well-known dataset. We propose a system that integrates four key modalities/channels using pre-trained models: RoBERTa for text, Wav2Vec2 for speech, a proposed FacialNet for facial expressions, and a CNN+Transformer architecture trained from scratch for video analysis. Feature embeddings from each modality are concatenated to form a multimodal vector, which is then used to predict emotion and sentiment labels. The multimodal system demonstrates superior performance compared to unimodal approaches, achieving an accuracy of 66.36% for emotion recognition and 72.15% for sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English: Accuracy and Disfluency Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an essential component of computer assisted language learning (CALL) and computer assisted language testing (CALT) for many years. As this technology continues to develop rapidly, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of current ASR systems for language learning applications. This study assesses five cutting-edge ASR systems' recognition of non-native accented English speech using recordings from the L2-ARCTIC corpus, featuring speakers from six different L1 backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese), in the form of both read and spontaneous speech. The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence recordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative recordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and AssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of 0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy. For spontaneous speech, RevAI performed best with a mean MER of 0.063. The study also examined how each system handled disfluencies such as filler words, repetitions, and revisions, finding significant variation in performance across systems and disfluency types. While processing speed varied considerably between systems, longer processing times did not necessarily correlate with better accuracy. By detailing the performance of several of the most recent, widely-available ASR systems on non-native English speech, this study aims to help language instructors and researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each system and identify which may be suitable for specific use cases.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Video-to-Audio Generation via Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio generation is essential for synthesizing realistic audio tracks that synchronize effectively with silent videos. Following the perspective of extracting essential signals from videos that can precisely control the mature text-to-audio generative diffusion models, this paper presents how to balance the representation of mel-spectrograms in terms of completeness and complexity through a new approach called Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition (Mel-QCD). We decompose the mel-spectrogram into three distinct types of signals, employing quantization or continuity to them, we can effectively predict them from video by a devised video-to-all (V2X) predictor. Then, the predicted signals are recomposed and fed into a ControlNet, along with a textual inversion design, to control the audio generation process. Our proposed Mel-QCD method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across eight metrics, evaluating dimensions such as quality, synchronization, and semantic consistency. Our codes and demos will be released at \href{Website}{https://wjc2830.github.io/MelQCD/}.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Knowledge Transfer Learning for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linguistic knowledge plays a crucial role in spoken language comprehension. It provides essential semantic and syntactic context for speech perception in noisy environments. However, most speech enhancement (SE) methods predominantly rely on acoustic features to learn the mapping relationship between noisy and clean speech, with limited exploration of linguistic integration. While text-informed SE approaches have been investigated, they often require explicit speech-text alignment or externally provided textual data, constraining their practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, using text as input poses challenges in aligning linguistic and acoustic representations due to their inherent differences. In this study, we propose the Cross-Modality Knowledge Transfer (CMKT) learning framework, which leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to infuse linguistic knowledge into SE models without requiring text input or LLMs during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a misalignment strategy to improve knowledge transfer. This strategy applies controlled temporal shifts, encouraging the model to learn more robust representations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMKT consistently outperforms baseline models across various SE architectures and LLM embeddings, highlighting its adaptability to different configurations. Additionally, results on Mandarin and English datasets confirm its effectiveness across diverse linguistic conditions, further validating its robustness. Moreover, CMKT remains effective even in scenarios without textual data, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications. By bridging the gap between linguistic and acoustic modalities, CMKT offers a scalable and innovative solution for integrating linguistic knowledge into SE models, leading to substantial improvements in both intelligibility and enhancement performance.</description>

      <title>Fully Reversing the Shoebox Image Source Method: From Impulse Responses to Room Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <title>SoundCTM: Unifying Score-based and Consistency Models for Full-band Text-to-Sound Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.</description>

      <title>Towards Sub-millisecond Latency Real-Time Speech Enhancement Models on Hearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low latency models are critical for real-time speech enhancement applications, such as hearing aids and hearables. However, the sub-millisecond latency space for resource-constrained hearables remains underexplored. We demonstrate speech enhancement using a computationally efficient minimum-phase FIR filter, enabling sample-by-sample processing to achieve mean algorithmic latency of 0.32 ms to 1.25 ms. With a single microphone, we observe a mean SI-SDRi of 4.1 dB. The approach shows generalization with a DNSMOS increase of 0.2 on unseen audio recordings. We use a lightweight LSTM-based model of 626k parameters to generate FIR taps. Using a real hardware implementation on a low-power DSP, our system can run with 376 MIPS and a mean end-to-end latency of 3.35 ms. In addition, we provide a comparison with existing low-latency spectral masking techniques. We hope this work will enable a better understanding of latency and can be used to improve the comfort and usability of hearables.</description>

      <title>Biodenoising: Animal Vocalization Denoising without Access to Clean Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animal vocalization denoising is a task similar to human speech enhancement, which is relatively well-studied. In contrast to the latter, it comprises a higher diversity of sound production mechanisms and recording environments, and this higher diversity is a challenge for existing models. Adding to the challenge and in contrast to speech, we lack large and diverse datasets comprising clean vocalizations. As a solution we use as training data pseudo-clean targets, i.e. pre-denoised vocalizations, and segments of background noise without a vocalization. We propose a train set derived from bioacoustics datasets and repositories representing diverse species, acoustic environments, geographic regions. Additionally, we introduce a non-overlapping benchmark set comprising clean vocalizations from different taxa and noise samples. We show that that denoising models (demucs, CleanUNet) trained on pseudo-clean targets obtained with speech enhancement models achieve competitive results on the benchmarking set. We publish data, code, libraries, and demos at https://earthspecies.github.io/biodenoising/.</description>

      <title>Gotta Hear Them All: Sound Source Aware Vision to Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. By addressing V2A generation at the sound-source level, SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance as evidenced by extensive experiments. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our generation can be tried and heard at https://ssv2a.github.io/SSV2A-demo .</description>

Abstract: The first Natural Office Talkers in Settings of Far-field Audio Recordings (NOTSOFAR-1) Challenge is a pivotal initiative that sets new benchmarks by offering datasets more representative of the needs of real-world business applications than those previously available. The challenge provides a unique combination of 280 recorded meetings across 30 diverse environments, capturing real-world acoustic conditions and conversational dynamics, and a 1000-hour simulated training dataset, synthesized with enhanced authenticity for real-world generalization, incorporating 15,000 real acoustic transfer functions. In this paper, we provide an overview of the systems submitted to the challenge and analyze the top-performing approaches, hypothesizing the factors behind their success. Additionally, we highlight promising directions left unexplored by participants. By presenting key findings and actionable insights, this work aims to drive further innovation and progress in DASR research and applications.</description>

      <title>KAD: No More FAD! An Effective and Efficient Evaluation Metric for Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.</description>

      <title>Clip-TTS: Contrastive Text-content and Mel-spectrogram, A High-Quality Text-to-Speech Method based on Contextual Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion datasets.Audio samples are available at: https://ltydd1314.github.io/.</description>
