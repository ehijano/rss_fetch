      <title>High-order implicit solver in conservative formulation for tokamak plasma transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient numerical scheme for solving transport equations for tokamak plasmas within an integrated modelling framework is presented. The plasma transport equations are formulated as diffusion-advection equations in two coordinates (a temporal and a spatial) featuring stiff non-linearities. The presented numerical scheme aims to minimise computational costs, which are associated with repeated calls of numerically expensive physical models in a processes of time stepping and non-linear convergence within an integrated modelling framework. The spatial discretisation is based on the 4th order accurate Interpolated Differential Operator in Conservative Formulation, the time-stepping method is the 2nd order accurate implicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and an under-relaxed Picard iteration is used for accelerating non-linear convergence. Temporal and spatial accuracies of the scheme allow for coarse grids, and the implicit time-stepping method together with the non-linear convergence approach contributes to robust and fast non-linear convergence. The spatial discretisation method enforces conservation in spatial coordinate up to the machine precision. The numerical scheme demonstrates accurate, stable and fast non-linear convergence in numerical tests using analytical stiff transport model. In particular, the 2nd order accuracy in time stepping significantly improves the overall convergence properties and the accuracy of simulating transient processes in comparison to the 1st order schemes.</description>

      <title>Stability of monodomain III-V crystals and antiphase boundaries over a Si monoatomic step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we compare the stabilities of different III-V crystals configurations on stepped Si substrates, with or without anti-phase boundaries, for abrupt and compensated interfaces, using density functional theory. Thermodynamic stability of the different heterostructures is analyzed with an atomic scale description of charge densities distribution and mechani-cal strain. We show that the configuration where a III-V crystal adapts to a Si monoatomic step through change of charge compensation at the hetero-interface is much more stable than the configuration in which an antiphase boundary is formed. This study thus demonstrates that antiphase boundaries commonly observed in III-V/Si samples are not origi-nating from Si monoatomic step edges but from inevitable kinetically driven coalescence of monophase 3D III-V islands.</description>

      <title>PSALTer: Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the PSALTer software for efficiently computing the mass and energy of the particle spectrum for any (e.g. higher-rank) tensor field theory in the Wolfram Language. The user must provide a Lagrangian density which is expanded quadratically in the fields around a Minkowski vacuum, is linear in the coupling coefficients, and otherwise built from the partial derivative and Minkowski metric. PSALTer automatically computes the spin-projection operators, saturated propagator, bare masses, residues of massive and massless poles and overall unitarity conditions in terms of the coupling coefficients. The constraints on the source currents and total number of gauge symmetries are produced as a by-product. We provide examples from scalar, vector, tensor and gauge theories of gravity. Each example, including spectra of higher-spin modified gravity theories, may be obtained on a personal computer in a matter of minutes. The software is also parallelised for use on high-performance computing resources. The initial release allows for parity-preserving operators constructed from fields of up to rank three: this functionality will be extended in future versions. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>Heron: Visualizing and Controlling Chemical Reaction Explorations and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-Fermi liquid physics of one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of one-dimensional generic spinless fermion lattice Hamiltonians that express quasi-Fermi liquid physics, manifesting both Luttinger and Fermi liquid features due to solely irrelevant interactions. Using infinite matrix product state techniques, we unveil its universal structure by calculating static and dynamic responses. Key features include a finite discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the Fermi level, despite power-law singularities in the spectral function protected by particle-hole symmetry. Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple disconnected saturated regions.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-theory informed integrators for cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: Large-scale cosmological simulations are an indispensable tool for modern cosmology. To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are critical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can be further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological perturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping schemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single leapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). As a corollary, these schemes exactly yield the analytic Zel'dovich solution in 1D in the pre-shell-crossing regime (i.e. before particle trajectories cross). One representative of this class is the popular FastPM scheme by Feng et al. 2016, which we take as our baseline. We then construct more powerful LPT-inspired integrators and show that they outperform FastPM and standard integrators in fast simulations in two and three dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(1 - 100)$ timesteps, requiring less steps to accurately reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum of the density field. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that, for any integrator, convergence is limited in the post-shell-crossing regime (to order 3/2 for planar wave collapse), owing to the lacking regularity of the acceleration field, which makes the use of high-order integrators in this regime futile. Also, we study the impact of the timestep spacing and of a decaying mode present in the initial conditions. Importantly, we find that symplecticity of the integrator plays a minor role for fast approximate simulations with a small number of timesteps.</description>

      <title>The tilted-plane structure of the energy of finite quantum systems</title>

Abstract: The piecewise linearity condition on the total energy with respect to the total magnetization of finite quantum systems is derived, using the infinite-separation-limit technique. This generalizes the well-known constancy condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density functional theory (DFT). The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans' theorem is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy surface of a finite system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat plane-structure of the oxygen atom, among others. We find that derivative discontinuities with respect to electron count sometimes occur at non-integer values. A diverse set of tilted plane structures is shown to occur in d-orbital subspaces, depending on chemical coordination. General occupancy-based total-energy expressions are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Local Volume Concentration, Packing Domains and Scaling Properties of Chromatin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV rules of return generate conformationally-defined domains observed by single cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as Rad21 degradation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties, fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits) equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations. Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to different kinds of similar tools in the community.</description>

      <title>Discovery of knowledge of wall-bounded turbulence via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of high performance computer and experimental technology, the study of turbulence has accumulated a large number of high fidelity data. However, few general turbulence knowledge has been found from the data. So we use the symbolic regression (SR) method to find a new mixing length formula which is generally valid in wall-bounded turbulence, and this formula has physical interpretation that it has correct asymptotic relationships in viscous sublayer,buffer layer, log-law region and outer region. Coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver, we test several classic cases. The prediction results fully demonstrate the accuracy and generalization of the formula. So far, we have found that SR method can help us find general laws from complex turbulent systems, and it is expected that through this 'white box' machine learning method, more turbulence knowledge with physical interpretation can be found in the future.</description>
