      <title>Achievable Rates and Error Exponents for a Class of Mismatched Compound Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates achievable information rates and error exponents of mismatched decoding when the channel belongs to the class of channels that are close to the decoding metric in terms of relative entropy. For both discrete- and continuous-alphabet channels, we derive approximations of the worst-case achievable information rates and error exponents as a function of the radius of a small relative entropy ball centered at the decoding metric, allowing the characterization of the loss incurred due to imperfect channel estimation. We provide a number of examples including symmetric metrics and modulo- additive noise metrics for discrete systems, and nearest neighbor decoding for continuous-alphabet channels, where we derive the approximation when the channel admits arbitrary statistics and when it is assumed noise-additive with unknown finite second-order moment.</description>

      <title>OFDM-PASS: Frequency-Selective Modeling and Analysis for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS), which utilize dielectric waveguides for adaptable antenna deployment, offer novel opportunities to create controllable line-of-sight links. This letter is the first to investigate the integration of PASS with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to ensure their compatibility and to explore the frequency-selective behavior inherent to PASS. First, an end-to-end channel model is proposed for OFDM PASS based on electromagnetic-compliant modeling of waveguides and coupled-mode theory, which includes frequency-dependent waveguide dispersion and antenna coupling effect. Furthermore, a critical dependence of the OFDM cyclic prefix (CP) overhead on the proximity of the operating frequency to the waveguide cutoff is revealed. Moreover, this letter evaluates an approximate pinching antenna location strategy based on path loss minimization, from which the phase misalignment effect across subcarriers in wideband scenarios is derived. Numerical results show that: 1) frequency-selective effects in OFDM PASS lead to substantial variations in subcarrier achievable rates, highlighting the necessity of operating above the waveguide cutoff frequency for effective communication; 2) frequency-independent pinching antenna location approximation incurs significant phase misalignment, particularly for wider bandwidths and larger array sizes; and 3) waveguide dispersion mandates considerable CP overhead when operating near the cutoff frequency, severely impacting the spectral efficiency of OFDM PASS.</description>

      <title>Polarforming for Wireless Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization, polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming, including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression. Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of implementation challenges to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Cellular Mobility Management via Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility management in cellular networks faces increasing complexity due to network densification and heterogeneous user mobility characteristics. Traditional handover (HO) mechanisms, which rely on predefined parameters such as A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT), often fail to optimize mobility performance across varying speeds and deployment conditions. Fixed A3-offset and TTT configurations either delay HOs, increasing radio link failures (RLFs), or accelerate them, leading to excessive ping-pong effects. To address these challenges, we propose two data-driven mobility management approaches leveraging high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). HD-BO optimizes HO parameters such as A3-offset and TTT, striking a desired trade-off between ping-pongs vs. RLF. DRL provides a non-parameter-based approach, allowing an agent to select serving cells based on real-time network conditions. We validate our approach using a real-world cellular deployment scenario, and employing Sionna ray tracing for site-specific channel propagation modeling. Results show that both HD-BO and DRL outperform 3GPP set-1 (TTT of 480 ms and A3-offset of 3 dB) and set-5 (TTT of 40 ms and A3-offset of -1 dB) benchmarks. We augment HD-BO with transfer learning so it can generalize across a range of user speeds. Applying the same transfer-learning strategy to the DRL method reduces its training time by a factor of 2.5 while preserving optimal HO performance, showing that it adapts efficiently to the mobility of aerial users such as UAVs. Simulations further reveal that HD-BO remains more sample-efficient than DRL, making it more suitable for scenarios with limited training data.</description>

      <title>Distribution Bounds on the Conditional ROC in a Poisson Field of Interferers and Clutters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework to characterize the distribution of the conditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in radar systems operating within a realization of a Poisson field of interferers and clutters. While conventional stochastic geometry based studies focus on the distribution of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), they fail to capture the statistical variations in detection and false-alarm performance across different network realizations. By leveraging higher-order versions of the Campbell-Mecke theorem and tools from stochastic geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the conditional false-alarm probability, and provide tight upper bounds using Cantelli's inequality. Additionally, we present a beta distribution approximation to capture the meta-distribution of the noise and interference power, enabling fine-grained performance evaluation. The results are extended to analyze the conditional detection probability, albeit with simpler bounds. Our approach reveals a new approach to radar design and robust ROC selection, including percentile-level guarantees, which are essential for emerging high-reliability applications. The insights derived here advocate for designing radar detection thresholds and signal processing algorithms based not merely on mean false-alarm or detection probabilities, but on tail behavior and percentile guarantees.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Training in Binarized Neural Networks Through the Lens of Algorithmic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</description>

      <title>Scattering Networks on Noncommutative Finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and nonabelian groups.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication meets System 2 ML: How Abstraction, Compositionality and Emergent Languages Shape Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trajectories of 6G and AI are set for a creative collision. However, current visions for 6G remain largely incremental evolutions of 5G, while progress in AI is hampered by brittle, data-hungry models that lack robust reasoning capabilities. This paper argues for a foundational paradigm shift, moving beyond the purely technical level of communication toward systems capable of semantic understanding and effective, goal-oriented interaction. We propose a unified research vision rooted in the principles of System-2 cognition, built upon three pillars: Abstraction, enabling agents to learn meaningful world models from raw sensorimotor data; Compositionality, providing the algebraic tools to combine learned concepts and subsystems; and Emergent Communication, allowing intelligent agents to create their own adaptive and grounded languages. By integrating these principles, we lay the groundwork for truly intelligent systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate, unifying advances in wireless communications, machine learning, and robotics under a single coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Through and beyond moments, entropies and Fisher information measures: new informational functionals and inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new classes of informational functionals, called \emph{upper moments}, respectively \emph{down-Fisher measures}, obtained by applying classical functionals such as $p$-moments and the Fisher information to the recently introduced up or down transformed probability density functions. We extend some of the the most important informational inequalities to our new functionals and establish optimal constants and minimizers for them. In particular, we highlight that, under certain constraints, the generalized Beta probability density maximizes (or minimizes) the upper-moments when the moment is fixed. Moreover, we apply these structured inequalities to systematically establish new and sharp upper bounds for the main classical informational products such as moment-entropy, Stam, or Cram\'er-Rao like products under certain regularity conditions. Other relevant properties, such as regularity under scaling changes or monotonicity with respect to the parameter, are studied. Applications to related problems to the Hausdorff moment problem are also given.</description>

      <title>Linearity-Inducing Priors for Poisson Parameter Estimation Under $L^{1}$ Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prior distributions for Poisson parameter estimation under $L^1$ loss. Specifically, we construct a new family of prior distributions whose optimal Bayesian estimators (the conditional medians) can be any prescribed increasing function that satisfies certain regularity conditions. In the case of affine estimators, this family is distinct from the usual conjugate priors, which are gamma distributions. Our prior distributions are constructed through a limiting process that matches certain moment conditions. These results provide the first explicit description of a family of distributions, beyond the conjugate priors, that satisfy the affine conditional median property; and more broadly for the Poisson noise model they can give any arbitrarily prescribed conditional median.</description>

      <title>A Convergence Theory for Diffusion Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.</description>

Abstract: Quantization for a Borel probability measure refers to the idea of estimating a given probability by a discrete probability with support containing a finite number of elements. In this paper, we have considered a Borel probability measure $P$ on $\mathbb R^2$, which has support a nonuniform stretched Sierpi\'{n}ski triangle generated by a set of three contractive similarity mappings on $\mathbb R^2$. For this probability measure, we investigate the optimal sets of $n$-means and the $n$th quantization errors for all positive integers $n$.</description>

These relationships allow to develop intuitions on the complexity behavior of $\beta$-expansions, and raise problems related to compressibility of binary sequences generated in the context of A/D conversion relying on $\beta$-expansions. Our last contribution is to solve these problems.</description>

      <title>A Logarithmic Decomposition and a Signed Measure Space for Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shannon entropy of a random variable has much behaviour analogous to a signed measure. Previous work has explored this connection by defining a signed measure on abstract sets, which are taken to represent the information that different random variables contain. This construction is sufficient to derive many measure-theoretical counterparts to information quantities such as the mutual information (the intersection of sets), the joint entropy (the union of sets), and the conditional entropy (the difference of sets). Here we provide concrete characterisations of these abstract sets and a corresponding signed measure by extending the approach used by Yeung to all possible outcomes in an outcome space $\Omega$, and in doing so we demonstrate that there exists a much finer decomposition with intuitive properties which we call the logarithmic decomposition (LD). We show that this signed measure space has the useful property that its logarithmic atoms are easily characterised with negative or positive entropy, depending only on their structure, while also being consistent with Yeung's I-measure. We present the usability of our approach by re-examining the G\'acs-K\"orner common information and minimally sufficient statistics from this new geometric perspective and characterising it in terms of our logarithmic atoms -- a property we call logarithmic decomposability. We present possible extensions of this construction to continuous probability distributions before discussing implications for quality-led information theory. As a motivating example, we apply our new decomposition to the Dyadic and Triadic systems of James and Crutchfield and show that, in contrast to the I-measure alone, our decomposition is able to qualitatively distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>Rician Channel Modelling for Super Wideband MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology include packing a large number of antenna elements in a compact array to access the bandwidth benefits provided by higher mutual coupling (MC). The resulting super-wideband (SW) systems require a circuit-theoretic framework to handle the MC and channel models which span extremely large bands. Hence, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we develop a physically-consistent Rician channel model for use with SW systems. Secondly, we express the circuit-theoretic models in terms of a standard MIMO model, so that insights into the effects of antenna layouts, MC, and bandwidth can be made using standard communication theory. For example, we show the bandwidth widening resulting from the new channel model. In addition, we show that MC distorts line-of-sight paths which has beamforming implications. We also highlight the interaction between spatial correlation and MC and show that tight coupling reduces spatial correlations at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Flexible Multi-Beam Synthesis and Directional Suppression Through Transmissive RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in recent years, existing beamforming methods still face significant challenges in achieving flexible and robust beam synthesis, which is an essential capability for a wide range of communication scenarios. This paper introduces a Max-min criterion with nonlinear constraints, leveraging optimization techniques to simultaneously enable flexible multi-beam synthesis and directional suppression using transmissive RIS. Firstly, a realistic model grounded in geometrical optics is introduced to characterize the input/output behaviors of transmissive RISs, effectively bridging the gap between explicit beamforming requirements and practical implementations. Subsequently, a highly efficient algorithm for constrained Max-min optimizations involving quadratic forms is developed. By introducing an auxiliary variable and applying the compensated convexity transform, we successfully reformulate the original non-convex problem and obtain the optimal solution iteratively. This approach is readily applicable to a wide range of constrained Max-min optimization problems. Finally, numerical simulations and prototype experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance or selectively suppress signal beams in designated spatial directions, outperforming existing methods in terms of beam control accuracy and robustness. This framework provides valuable insights and references for practical communications applications such as physical layer security and interference mitigation.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Secure ISAC Against Dual Eavesdropping Threats: Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient beamforming design is proposed for continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-MIMO systems, whose optimal beamforming can be obtained using singular-value decomposition, CAPA-MIMO systems require solving the eigendecomposition of a Hermitian kernel operator, which is computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, an explicit closed-form expression for the achievable rate of CAPA-MIMO systems is first derived as a function of the continuous transmit beamformer. Subsequently, an iterative weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm is proposed, directly addressing the CAPA-MIMO beamforming optimization without discretization approximation. Closed-form updates for each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm are derived via the calculus of variations (CoV) method. For low-complexity implementation, an equivalent matrix-based iterative solution is introduced using Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Our numerical results demonstrate that 1) CAPA-MIMO achieves substantial performance gain over the SPDA-MIMO, 2) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enhances performance while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art Fourier-based approaches, and 3) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enables practical realization of parallel, non-interfering transmissions.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Differential Privacy: A Participatory AI Framework for Public Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conversational interface system that enables participatory design of differentially private AI systems in public sector applications. Addressing the challenge of balancing mathematical privacy guarantees with democratic accountability, we propose three key contributions: (1) an adaptive $\epsilon$-selection protocol leveraging TOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis to align citizen preferences with differential privacy (DP) parameters, (2) an explainable noise-injection framework featuring real-time Mean Absolute Error (MAE) visualizations and GPT-4-powered impact analysis, and (3) an integrated legal-compliance mechanism that dynamically modulates privacy budgets based on evolving regulatory constraints. Our results advance participatory AI practices by demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance public engagement in algorithmic privacy mechanisms, ensuring that privacy-preserving AI in public sector governance remains both mathematically robust and democratically accountable.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Intelligent Reffecting Surface Aided Near-Field THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) operating in the terahertz (THz) band has recently gained considerable interest due to its high spectrum bandwidth. Due to the exploitation of large scale of IRS, there is a high probability that the transceivers will be situated within the near-field region of the IRS. Thus, the near-field beam split effect poses a major challenge for the design of wideband IRS beamforming, which causes the radiation beam to deviate from its intended location, leading to significant gain losses and limiting the efficient use of available bandwidths. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this letter, we first investigate the near-field beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piece-wise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. Numerical results show that the proposed DLDD IRS beamforming scheme can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.</description>
