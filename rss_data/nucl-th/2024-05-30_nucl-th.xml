      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin impurity from Coulomb core-polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$: Insights from PREX-II and validation via $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impurity in the neutron skin induced by Coulomb core-polarization, highlighting its impact on uncertainties in neutron skin measurements from PREX-II. This effect is validated using the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction at 420 MeV. Our findings reveal that the Coulomb boundary radius, where core-polarization becomes negligible, is critical for accurately probing the neutron skin in the target nucleus. Notably, the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS experiment conducted by Zegers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 202501 (2007)] primarily detects neutron excess at zero scattering angle due to the core-polarization phenomenon, rather than the neutron skin. We propose extending this experiment to measure cross sections at a 3$^\circ$ angle to more precisely determine the neutron skin thickness in $^{208}\text{Pb}$. Additionally, uncertainties in PREX-II may arise from electrons initially probing neutron excess instead of the neutron skin, potentially leading to an overestimation of neutron skin thickness due to the mixing effect where protons are displaced into the neutron skin region.</description>

      <title>An $\textit{ab initio}$ recipe for taming nuclear-structure dependence of $ V_{ud} $: the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first ab initio calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.400 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.7$-times reduction in the nuclear uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with \ensuremath{\mathrm{e^+e^-}}\xspace collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central AA as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>

      <title>Measuring differential particle correlations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependencies of Symmetric and Asymmetric Correlations (SC and ASC) with one and two particles of interest in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Leveraging the AMPT model, the investigation delves into the sensitivity of these correlations to the final state effects, providing valuable insights into their potential for constraining the final state effects' $p_T$ dependencies. The HIJING model is employed as a benchmark for non-flow correlations, shedding light on their impact on interpreting SC and ASC data. Moreover, the study points out that differential SC and ASC with one and two particles of interest (POIs) typically incorporate contributions from event-plane angle fluctuations. Consequently, this work highlights the significance of SC and ASC with one and two POIs as valuable tools for investigating the $p_T$ nature of the final state effects and advocates for comprehensive experimental measurements across various beam energies and system sizes to enhance our understanding and provide additional constraints for theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and others stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizeable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Double parton scattering versus jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel observable, the double nuclear modification factor, is proposed to probe simultaneously the initial and final state effects in nucleus-nucleus collisions. An interesting competition between the combinatorial enhancement in the double parton scattering and the suppression due to parton energy loss can be observed in the production rate of two hard particles. In particular, the production of $J/\psi$ mesons in association with a $W$ boson is not suppressed but is enhanced in the region of moderate transverse momenta, unlike the case of unassociated (inclusive) $J/\psi$ production. At the same time, in the region of high enough transverse momenta the nuclear modification factor for associated $J/\psi+W$ production converges to that of unassociated $J/\psi$.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous double alpha decay: First experimental limit and prospects of investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear decays with simultaneous emission of two alpha particles are energetically possible for a number of nuclides. Prospects of searching for such kind of decay for nuclides present in the natural isotopic composition of elements are discussed here. The first experimental limit on half-life for 2alpha decay is set for 209Bi as T1/2 &gt; 2.9e20 y at 90% C.L., using the data of work [P. de Marcillac et al., Nature 422 (2003) 876]. Theoretical T1/2 estimations for the process are also given. Using these values, which are on the level of 1e33 y or more, one can conclude that the prospects of experimental observation of 2alpha decay are very pessimistic.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Bulk Rheology: From Neutron Star Mergers to Viscous Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the first causal and stable theory of a bulk-viscous relativistic pseudoplastic (or dilatant) fluid. This new formalism brings to light the rheological properties of several relativistic physical systems. Neutron star collisions can behave as a relativistic pseudoplastic material with viscous properties dictated by the non-conservation of lepton currents due to weak decay. Two-temperature relativistic plasmas, such as those surrounding supermassive galactic black holes, are predominantly pseudoplastic. Our framework can also be employed to construct novel viscous models for the evolution of the Universe with pseudoplastic or dilatant features.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media: From coherent oscillations to flavor equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However, some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where $\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit $\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$. These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.</description>
