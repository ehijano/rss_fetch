      <title>Modifying Final Splits of Classification Tree for Fine-tuning Subpopulation Target in Policy Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policymakers often use Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to partition populations based on binary outcomes and target subpopulations whose probability of the binary event exceeds a threshold. However, classic CART and knowledge distillation method whose student model is a CART (referred to as KD-CART) do not minimize the misclassification risk associated with classifying the latent probabilities of these binary events. To reduce the misclassification risk, we propose two methods, Penalized Final Split (PFS) and Maximizing Distance Final Split (MDFS). PFS incorporates a tunable penalty into the standard CART splitting criterion function. MDFS maximizes a weighted sum of distances between node means and the threshold. It can point-identify the optimal split under the unique intersect latent probability assumption. In addition, we develop theoretical result for MDFS splitting rule estimation, which has zero asymptotic risk. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that these methods predominately outperform classic CART and KD-CART in terms of misclassification error. Furthermore, in our empirical evaluations, these methods provide deeper insights than the two baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Variational phylogenetic inference with products over bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian phylogenetics requires accurate and efficient approximation of posterior distributions over trees. In this work, we develop a variational Bayesian approach for ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We present a novel variational family based on coalescent times of a single-linkage clustering and derive a closed-form density of the resulting distribution over trees. Unlike existing methods for ultrametric trees, our method performs inference over all of tree space, it does not require any Markov chain Monte Carlo subroutines, and our variational family is differentiable. Through experiments on benchmark genomic datasets and an application to SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy while requiring significantly fewer gradient evaluations than existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15215v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions so called components, is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural network models have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating components since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably. We call our proposed model ANOVA-NODE since it is a modification of Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE) for the functional ANOVA model. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-NODE can approximate a smooth function well. Additionally, we experimentally show that ANOVA-NODE provides much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural network models do.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Cumulative Covariance Net for Deep Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction with Random Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction\citep{libing_generalSDR}, which constructs nonlinear low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data, is an important branch of representation learning. However, most existing methods are not applicable when the response variables are complex non-Euclidean random objects, which are frequently encountered in many recent statistical applications. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical dependence measure termed Fr\'echet Cumulative Covariance (FCCov) and develop a novel nonlinear SDR framework based on FCCov. Our approach is not only applicable to complex non-Euclidean data, but also exhibits robustness against outliers. We further incorporate Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate nonlinear sufficient directions in the sample level. Theoretically, we prove that our method with squared Frobenius norm regularization achieves unbiasedness at the $\sigma$-field level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for our estimators based on FNNs and ResNet-type CNNs, which match the minimax rate of nonparametric regression up to logarithmic factors. Intensive simulation studies verify the performance of our methods in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean settings. We apply our method to facial expression recognition datasets and the results underscore more realistic and broader applicability of our proposal.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show a more concise and high level proof than the original one, derived by researcher Bart Jacobs, for the following theorem: in the context of Bayesian update rules for learning or updating internal states that produce predictions, the relative entropy between the observations and the predictions is reduced when applying Jeffrey's update rule to update the internal state.</description>

      <title>Generalization Guarantees for Representation Learning via Data-Dependent Gaussian Mixture Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish in-expectation and tail bounds on the generalization error of representation learning type algorithms. The bounds are in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from the training and "test'' datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for the training and test datasets. Our bounds are shown to reflect the "structure" and "simplicity'' of the encoder and significantly improve upon the few existing ones for the studied model. We then use our in-expectation bound to devise a suitable data-dependent regularizer; and we investigate thoroughly the important question of the selection of the prior. We propose a systematic approach to simultaneously learning a data-dependent Gaussian mixture prior and using it as a regularizer. Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in this procedure. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms the now popular Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) method as well as the recent Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB).</description>

      <title>Feature maps for the Laplacian kernel and its generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent applications of kernel methods in machine learning have seen a renewed interest in the Laplacian kernel, due to its stability to the bandwidth hyperparameter in comparison to the Gaussian kernel, as well as its expressivity being equivalent to that of the neural tangent kernel of deep fully connected networks. However, unlike the Gaussian kernel, the Laplacian kernel is not separable. This poses challenges for techniques to approximate it, especially via the random Fourier features (RFF) methodology and its variants. In this work, we provide random features for the Laplacian kernel and its two generalizations: Mat\'{e}rn kernel and the Exponential power kernel. We provide efficiently implementable schemes to sample weight matrices so that random features approximate these kernels. These weight matrices have a weakly coupled heavy-tailed randomness. Via numerical experiments on real datasets we demonstrate the efficacy of these random feature maps.</description>

      <title>Reward-Guided Iterative Refinement in Diffusion Models at Test-Time with Applications to Protein and DNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fully leverage the capabilities of diffusion models, we are often interested in optimizing downstream reward functions during inference. While numerous algorithms for reward-guided generation have been recently proposed due to their significance, current approaches predominantly focus on single-shot generation, transitioning from fully noised to denoised states. We propose a novel framework for inference-time reward optimization with diffusion models inspired by evolutionary algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative refinement process consisting of two steps in each iteration: noising and reward-guided denoising. This sequential refinement allows for the gradual correction of errors introduced during reward optimization. Besides, we provide a theoretical guarantee for our framework. Finally, we demonstrate its superior empirical performance in protein and cell-type-specific regulatory DNA design.

      <title>Symmetric observations without symmetric causal explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring causal models from observed correlations is a challenging task, crucial to many areas of science. In order to alleviate the effort, it is important to know whether symmetries in the observations correspond to symmetries in the underlying realization. Via an explicit example, we answer this question in the negative. We use a tripartite probability distribution over binary events that is realized by using three (different) independent sources of classical randomness. We prove that even removing the condition that the sources distribute systems described by classical physics, the requirements that i) the sources distribute the same physical systems, ii) these physical systems respect relativistic causality, and iii) the correlations are the observed ones, are incompatible.</description>

      <title>Joint Registration and Conformal Prediction for Partially Observed Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting missing segments in partially observed functions is challenging due to infinite-dimensionality, complex dependence within and across observations, and irregular noise. These challenges are further exacerbated by the existence of two distinct sources of variation in functional data, termed amplitude (variation along the $y$-axis) and phase (variation along the $x$-axis). While registration can disentangle them from complete functional data, the process is more difficult for partial observations. Thus, existing methods for functional data prediction often ignore phase variation. Furthermore, they rely on strong parametric assumptions, and require either precise model specifications or computationally intensive techniques, such as bootstrapping, to construct prediction intervals. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified registration and prediction approach for partially observed functions under the conformal prediction framework, which separately focuses on the amplitude and phase components. By leveraging split conformal methods, our approach integrates registration and prediction while ensuring exchangeability through carefully constructed predictor-response pairs. Using a neighborhood smoothing algorithm, the framework produces pointwise prediction bands with finite-sample marginal coverage guarantees under weak assumptions. The method is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and suitable for parallelization. Numerical studies and real-world data examples clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Neural Network Training: An Analysis of the AlgoPerf Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms competition is to evaluate practical speed-ups in neural network training achieved solely by improving the underlying training algorithms. In the external tuning ruleset, submissions must provide workload-agnostic hyperparameter search spaces, while in the self-tuning ruleset they must be completely hyperparameter-free. In both rulesets, submissions are compared on time-to-result across multiple deep learning workloads, training on fixed hardware. This paper presents the inaugural AlgoPerf competition's results, which drew 18 diverse submissions from 10 teams. Our investigation reveals several key findings: (1) The winning submission in the external tuning ruleset, using Distributed Shampoo, demonstrates the effectiveness of non-diagonal preconditioning over popular methods like Adam, even when compared on wall-clock runtime. (2) The winning submission in the self-tuning ruleset, based on the Schedule Free AdamW algorithm, demonstrates a new level of effectiveness for completely hyperparameter-free training algorithms. (3) The top-scoring submissions were surprisingly robust to workload changes. We also discuss the engineering challenges encountered in ensuring a fair comparison between different training algorithms. These results highlight both the significant progress so far, and the considerable room for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Estimating Neural Representation Alignment from Limited Inputs and Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both artificial and biological systems, the centered kernel alignment (CKA) has become a widely used tool for quantifying neural representation similarity. While current CKA estimators typically correct for the effects of finite stimuli sampling, the effects of sampling a subset of neurons are overlooked, introducing notable bias in standard experimental scenarios. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis showing how this bias is affected by the representation geometry. We then introduce a novel estimator that corrects for both input and feature sampling. We use our method for evaluating both brain-to-brain and model-to-brain alignments and show that it delivers reliable comparisons even with very sparsely sampled neurons. We perform within-animal and across-animal comparisons on electrophysiological data from visual cortical areas V1, V4, and IT data, and use these as benchmarks to evaluate model-to-brain alignment. We also apply our method to reveal how object representations become progressively disentangled across layers in both biological and artificial systems. These findings underscore the importance of correcting feature-sampling biases in CKA and demonstrate that our bias-corrected estimator provides a more faithful measure of representation alignment. The improved estimates increase our understanding of how neural activity is structured across both biological and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Do we really need the Rademacher complexities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning with respect to the squared loss in a convex class. The state-of-the-art sample complexity estimates in this setting rely on Rademacher complexities, which are generally difficult to control. We prove that, contrary to prevailing belief and under minimal assumptions, the sample complexity is not governed by the Rademacher complexities but rather by the behaviour of the limiting gaussian process. In particular, all such learning problems that have the same $L_2$-structure -- even those with heavy-tailed distributions -- share the same sample complexity. This constitutes the first universality result for general convex learning problems.
  The proof is based on a novel learning procedure, and its performance is studied by combining optimal mean estimation techniques for real-valued random variables with Talagrand's generic chaining method.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Provable Calibration in High-Dimensional Binary Classification: Angular Calibration and Platt Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of calibrating a linear binary classifier of the form $\sigma(\hat{w}^\top x)$, where the feature vector $x$ is Gaussian, $\sigma$ is a link function, and $\hat{w}$ is an estimator of the true linear weight $w^\star$. By interpolating with a noninformative $\textit{chance classifier}$, we construct a well-calibrated predictor whose interpolation weight depends on the angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ between the estimator $\hat{w}$ and the true linear weight $w_\star$. We establish that this angular calibration approach is provably well-calibrated in a high-dimensional regime where the number of samples and features both diverge, at a comparable rate. The angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ can be consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting predictor is uniquely $\textit{Bregman-optimal}$, minimizing the Bregman divergence to the true label distribution within a suitable class of calibrated predictors. Our work is the first to provide a calibration strategy that satisfies both calibration and optimality properties provably in high dimensions. Additionally, we identify conditions under which a classical Platt-scaling predictor converges to our Bregman-optimal calibrated solution. Thus, Platt-scaling also inherits these desirable properties provably in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free bounds in high-dimensional linear regression via error-in-operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of high-dimensional linear regression with random design. We suggest a novel approach referred to as error-in-operator which does not estimate the design covariance $\Sigma$ directly but incorporates it into empirical risk minimization. We provide an expansion of the excess prediction risk and derive non-asymptotic dimension-free bounds on the leading term and the remainder. This helps us to show that auxiliary variables do not increase the effective dimension of the problem, provided that parameters of the procedure are tuned properly. We also discuss computational aspects of our method and illustrate its performance with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Model Privacy: A Unified Framework to Understand Model Stealing Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, highlighting the importance of understanding and ensuring its safety. One pressing concern is the vulnerability of ML applications to model stealing attacks. These attacks involve adversaries attempting to recover a learned model through limited query-response interactions, such as those found in cloud-based services or on-chip artificial intelligence interfaces. While existing literature proposes various attack and defense strategies, these often lack a theoretical foundation and standardized evaluation criteria. In response, this work presents a framework called ``Model Privacy'', providing a foundation for comprehensively analyzing model stealing attacks and defenses. We establish a rigorous formulation for the threat model and objectives, propose methods to quantify the goodness of attack and defense strategies, and analyze the fundamental tradeoffs between utility and privacy in ML models. Our developed theory offers valuable insights into enhancing the security of ML models, especially highlighting the importance of the attack-specific structure of perturbations for effective defenses. We demonstrate the application of model privacy from the defender's perspective through various learning scenarios. Extensive experiments corroborate the insights and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms developed under the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Transformers against Context Hijacking for Linear Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful in-context learning capabilities. However, their predictions can be disrupted by factually correct context, a phenomenon known as context hijacking, revealing a significant robustness issue. To understand this phenomenon theoretically, we explore an in-context linear classification problem based on recent advances in linear transformers. In our setup, context tokens are designed as factually correct query-answer pairs, where the queries are similar to the final query but have opposite labels. Then, we develop a general theoretical analysis on the robustness of the linear transformers, which is formulated as a function of the model depth, training context lengths, and number of hijacking context tokens. A key finding is that a well-trained deeper transformer can achieve higher robustness, which aligns with empirical observations. We show that this improvement arises because deeper layers enable more fine-grained optimization steps, effectively mitigating interference from context hijacking. This is also well supported by our numerical experiments. Our findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits of deeper architectures and contribute to enhancing the understanding of transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Mantis: Lightweight Calibrated Foundation Model for User-Friendly Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing foundation models for time series data that can generalize across diverse downstream tasks. While numerous forecasting-oriented foundation models have been introduced, there is a notable scarcity of models tailored for time series classification. To address this gap, we present Mantis, a new open-source foundation model for time series classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained using a contrastive learning approach. Our experimental results show that Mantis outperforms existing foundation models both when the backbone is frozen and when fine-tuned, while achieving the lowest calibration error. In addition, we propose several adapters to handle the multivariate setting, reducing memory requirements and modeling channel interdependence.</description>

      <title>Logit Disagreement: OoD Detection with Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which estimate the full posterior distribution over model parameters, are well-known for their role in uncertainty quantification and its promising application in out-of-distribution detection (OoD). Amongst other uncertainty measures, BNNs provide a state-of-the art estimation of predictive entropy (total uncertainty) which can be decomposed as the sum of mutual information and expected entropy. In the context of OoD detection the estimation of predictive uncertainty in the form of the predictive entropy score confounds aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, the latter being hypothesized to be high for OoD points. Despite these justifications, the mutual information score has been shown to perform worse than predictive entropy. Taking inspiration from Bayesian variational autoencoder (BVAE) literature, this work proposes to measure the disagreement between a corrected version of the pre-softmax quantities, otherwise known as logits, as an estimate of epistemic uncertainty for Bayesian NNs under mean field variational inference. The three proposed epistemic uncertainty scores demonstrate marked improvements over mutual information on a range of OoD experiments, with equal performance otherwise. Moreover, the epistemic uncertainty scores perform on par with the Bayesian benchmark predictive entropy on a range of MNIST and CIFAR10 experiments.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of high-dimensional mixture models: Effective spectral theory and dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local geometry of empirical risks in high dimensions via the spectral theory of their Hessian and information matrices. We focus on settings where the data, $(Y_\ell)_{\ell =1}^n\in \mathbb R^d$, are i.i.d. draws of a $k$-component Gaussian mixture model, and the loss depends on the projection of the data into a fixed number of vectors, namely $\mathbf{x}^\top Y$, where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times C}$ are the parameters, and $C$ need not equal $k$. This setting captures a broad class of problems such as classification by one and two-layer networks and regression on multi-index models. We prove exact formulas for the limits of the empirical spectral distribution and outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices in the proportional asymptotics limit, where the number of samples and dimension $n,d\to\infty$ and $n/d=\phi \in (0,\infty)$. These limits depend on the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ only through the summary statistic of the $(C+k)\times (C+k)$ Gram matrix of the parameters and class means, $\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})^\top(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})$. It is known that under general conditions, when $\mathbf{x}$ is trained by stochastic gradient descent, the evolution of these same summary statistics along training converges to the solution of an autonomous system of ODEs, called the effective dynamics. This enables us to connect the spectral theory to the training dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by analyzing the effective spectrum along the effective dynamics in the case of multi-class logistic regression. In this setting, the empirical Hessian and information matrices have substantially different spectra, each with their own static and even dynamical spectral transitions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion bridges for distribution transport problems have heavily relied on matching frameworks, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between scalability and access to optimal pairings during training. Fully unsupervised methods make minimal assumptions but incur high computational costs, limiting their practicality. On the other hand, imposing full supervision of the matching process with optimal pairings improves scalability, however, it can be infeasible in many applications. To strike a balance between scalability and minimal supervision, we introduce Feedback Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (FSBM), a novel semi-supervised matching framework that incorporates a small portion (less than 8% of the entire dataset) of pre-aligned pairs as state feedback to guide the transport map of non coupled samples, thereby significantly improving efficiency. This is achieved by formulating a static Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem with an additional term capturing the semi-supervised guidance. The generalized EOT objective is then recast into a dynamic formulation to leverage the scalability of matching frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FSBM accelerates training and enhances generalization by leveraging coupled pairs guidance, opening new avenues for training matching frameworks with partially aligned datasets.</description>

      <title>Refined Risk Bounds for Unbounded Losses via Transductive Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the sequential variants of linear regression with the squared loss, classification problems with hinge loss, and logistic regression, all characterized by unbounded losses in the setup where no assumptions are made on the magnitude of design vectors and the norm of the optimal vector of parameters. The key distinction from existing results lies in our assumption that the set of design vectors is known in advance (though their order is not), a setup sometimes referred to as transductive online learning. While this assumption seems similar to fixed design regression or denoising, we demonstrate that the sequential nature of our algorithms allows us to convert our bounds into statistical ones with random design without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of the design vectors--an impossibility for standard denoising results. Our key tools are based on the exponential weights algorithm with carefully chosen transductive (design-dependent) priors, which exploit the full horizon of the design vectors.
  Our classification regret bounds have a feature that is only attributed to bounded losses in the literature: they depend solely on the dimension of the parameter space and on the number of rounds, independent of the design vectors or the norm of the optimal solution. For linear regression with squared loss, we further extend our analysis to the sparse case, providing sparsity regret bounds that additionally depend on the magnitude of the response variables. We argue that these improved bounds are specific to the transductive setting and unattainable in the worst-case sequential setup. Our algorithms, in several cases, have polynomial time approximations and reduce to sampling with respect to log-concave measures instead of aggregating over hard-to-construct $\varepsilon$-covers of classes.</description>

      <title>Exact Risk Curves of signSGD in High-Dimensions: Quantifying Preconditioning and Noise-Compression Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, signSGD has garnered interest as both a practical optimizer as well as a simple model to understand adaptive optimizers like Adam. Though there is a general consensus that signSGD acts to precondition optimization and reshapes noise, quantitatively understanding these effects in theoretically solvable settings remains difficult. We present an analysis of signSGD in a high dimensional limit, and derive a limiting SDE and ODE to describe the risk. Using this framework we quantify four effects of signSGD: effective learning rate, noise compression, diagonal preconditioning, and gradient noise reshaping. Our analysis is consistent with experimental observations but moves beyond that by quantifying the dependence of these effects on the data and noise distributions. We conclude with a conjecture on how these results might be extended to Adam.</description>

      <title>The Observational Partial Order of Causal Structures with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second. Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives a review of concentration inequalities which are widely employed in non-asymptotical analyses of mathematical statistics in a wide range of settings, from distribution-free to distribution-dependent, from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential, sub-Gamma, and sub-Weibull random variables, and from the mean to the maximum concentration. This review provides results in these settings with some fresh new results. Given the increasing popularity of high-dimensional data and inference, results in the context of high-dimensional linear and Poisson regressions are also provided. We aim to illustrate the concentration inequalities with known constants and to improve existing bounds with sharper constants.</description>

      <title>BARTSIMP: flexible spatial covariate modeling and prediction using Bayesian additive regression trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction is a classic challenge in spatial statistics and the inclusion of spatial covariates can greatly improve predictive performance when incorporated into a model with latent spatial effects. It is desirable to develop flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities and interactions in the covariate specification. Existing machine learning approaches that allow for spatial dependence in the residuals fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we investigate the combination of a Gaussian process spatial model with a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model. The computational burden of the approach is reduced by combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) technique. We study the performance of the method first via simulation. We then use the model to predict anthropometric responses in Kenya, with the data collected via a complex sampling design. In particular, household survey data are collected via stratified two-stage unequal probability cluster sampling, which requires special care when modeled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential mean estimation in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we derive time-uniform confidence spheres -- confidence sphere sequences (CSSs) -- which contain the mean of random vectors with high probability simultaneously across all sample sizes. Our results include a dimension-free CSS for log-concave random vectors, a dimension-free CSS for sub-Gaussian random vectors, and CSSs for sub-$\psi$ random vectors (which includes sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and sub-exponential distributions). Many of our results are optimal. For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid. Our work is based on PAC-Bayesian theory and inspired by an approach of Catoni and Giulini.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Learning has received significant attention in the field of machine learning for its potential in selecting the most informative samples for labeling, thereby reducing data annotation costs. However, we show that the reported lifts in recent literature generalize poorly to other domains leading to an inconclusive landscape in Active Learning research. Furthermore, we highlight overlooked problems for reproducing AL experiments that can lead to unfair comparisons and increased variance in the results. This paper addresses these issues by providing an Active Learning framework for a fair comparison of algorithms across different tasks and domains, as well as a fast and performant oracle algorithm for evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first AL benchmark that tests algorithms in 3 major domains: Tabular, Image, and Text. We report empirical results for 6 widely used algorithms on 7 real-world and 2 synthetic datasets and aggregate them into a domain-specific ranking of AL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Downstream Task Performance in Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws provide important insights that can guide the design of large language models (LLMs). Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by: downstream cross-entropy and translation quality metrics such as BLEU and COMET scores. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and translation quality scores improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream translation quality metrics with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are cases where moderate misalignment causes the downstream translation scores to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Estimators of Squared Calibration Errors in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a mean-squared error-based risk that enables the comparison and optimization of estimators of squared calibration errors in practical settings. Improving the calibration of classifiers is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models, especially in sensitive decision-making scenarios. Although various calibration (error) estimators exist in the current literature, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its hyperparameters. By leveraging the bilinear structure of squared calibration errors, we reformulate calibration estimation as a regression problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input pairs. This reformulation allows us to quantify the performance of different estimators even for the most challenging calibration criterion, known as canonical calibration. Our approach advocates for a training-validation-testing pipeline when estimating a calibration error on an evaluation dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by optimizing existing calibration estimators and comparing them with novel kernel ridge regression-based estimators on standard image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}.
  A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</description>

      <title>SpinSVAR: Estimating Structural Vector Autoregression Assuming Sparse Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SpinSVAR, a novel method for estimating a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) from time-series data under sparse input assumption. Unlike prior approaches using Gaussian noise, we model the input as independent Laplacian variables, enforcing sparsity and yielding a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) based on least absolute error regression. We provide theoretical consistency guarantees for the MLE under mild assumptions. SpinSVAR is efficient: it can leverage GPU acceleration to scale to thousands of nodes. On synthetic data with Laplacian or Bernoulli-uniform inputs, SpinSVAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and runtime. When applied to S&amp;P 500 data, it clusters stocks by sectors and identifies significant structural shocks linked to major price movements, demonstrating the viability of our sparse input assumption.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia holds the largest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. In the face of climate change, precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for hydrological modelling in this area. Future precipitation predictions remain challenging due to complex orography, lack of in situ hydrological observations, and limitations in climate model resolution and parametrisation for this region. To address the uncertainty posed by these challenges, climate models are often aggregated into multi-model ensembles. While multi-model ensembles are known to improve the predictive accuracy and analysis of future climate projections, consensus regarding how models are aggregated is lacking. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine 13 regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over High Mountain Asia. Our approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The framework is validated against gridded historical precipitation data and is used to generate projections for the near future (2036$\unicode{x2013}$2065) and far future (2066$\unicode{x2013}$2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.</description>

      <title>Linear $Q$-Learning Does Not Diverge in $L^2$: Convergence Rates to a Bounded Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. It is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence until the recent work Meyn (2024) which establishes the ultimate almost sure boundedness of the iterates of linear $Q$-learning. Building on this success, this paper further establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning iterates (to a bounded set). Similar to Meyn (2024), we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</description>

      <title>Stein Discrepancy for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) leverages information from a labeled source dataset to improve accuracy on a related but unlabeled target dataset. A common approach to UDA is aligning representations from the source and target domains by minimizing the distance between their data distributions. Previous methods have employed distances such as Wasserstein distance and maximum mean discrepancy. However, these approaches are less effective when the target data is significantly scarcer than the source data. Stein discrepancy is an asymmetric distance between distributions that relies on one distribution only through its score function. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method that uses Stein discrepancy to measure the distance between source and target domains. We develop a learning framework using both non-kernelized and kernelized Stein discrepancy. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound for the generalization error. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods using other domain discrepancy measures when only small amounts of target data are available.</description>

      <title>LLM-Lasso: A Robust Framework for Domain-Informed Feature Selection and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-Lasso, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide feature selection in Lasso $\ell_1$ regression. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on numerical data, LLM-Lasso incorporates domain-specific knowledge extracted from natural language, enhanced through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, to seamlessly integrate data-driven modeling with contextual insights. Specifically, the LLM generates penalty factors for each feature, which are converted into weights for the Lasso penalty using a simple, tunable model. Features identified as more relevant by the LLM receive lower penalties, increasing their likelihood of being retained in the final model, while less relevant features are assigned higher penalties, reducing their influence. Importantly, LLM-Lasso has an internal validation step that determines how much to trust the contextual knowledge in our prediction pipeline. Hence it addresses key challenges in robustness, making it suitable for mitigating potential inaccuracies or hallucinations from the LLM. In various biomedical case studies, LLM-Lasso outperforms standard Lasso and existing feature selection baselines, all while ensuring the LLM operates without prior access to the datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to effectively integrate conventional feature selection techniques directly with LLM-based domain-specific reasoning.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Gibbs algorithm with high probability at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gives a bound on the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm, which recovers known data-independent bounds for the high temperature range and extends to the low-temperature range, where generalization depends critically on the data-dependent loss-landscape. It is shown, that with high probability the generalization error of a single hypothesis drawn from the Gibbs posterior decreases with the total prior volume of all hypotheses with similar or smaller empirical error. This gives theoretical support to the belief in the benefit of flat minima. The zero temperature limit is discussed and the bound is extended to a class of similar stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Full-information Online Learning: from Finite to Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analysis of Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling with a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature has a $\mathcal{O}(\beta\sqrt{T\log(1+\lambda)})$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz adversary.</description>
