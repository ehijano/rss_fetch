      <title>Zero-Knowledge Audit for Internet of Agents: Privacy-Preserving Communication Verification with Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing agent communication frameworks face critical limitations in providing verifiable audit trails without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of agent interactions. The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments.
  We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.
  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy.</description>

      <title>Persistent Backdoor Attacks under Continual Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Augmented AI/ML for O-RAN: Hierarchical Threat Detection with Synergistic Intelligence and Interpretability (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.</description>

      <title>Factor(U,T): Controlling Untrusted AI by Monitoring their Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Factor($U$,$T$), in which an untrusted (stronger but potentially malicious) model decomposes while trusted models implement child tasks. Can monitors detect malicious activity when observing only natural language task instructions, rather than complete solutions? We baseline and red team Factor($U$,$T$) in control evaluations on BigCodeBench, a dataset of Python coding tasks. Monitors distinguishing malicious from honest decompositions perform poorly (AUROC 0.52) compared to monitors evaluating complete Python solutions (AUROC 0.96). Furthermore, Factor($D$,$U$), which uses a trusted decomposer and monitors concrete child solutions, achieves excellent discrimination (AUROC 0.96) and strong safety (1.2% ASR), demonstrating that implementation-context monitoring succeeds where decomposition-only monitoring fails.</description>

      <title>BLINDSPOT: Enabling Bystander-Controlled Privacy Signaling for Camera-Enabled Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-equipped mobile devices, such as phones, smart glasses, and AR headsets, pose a privacy challenge for bystanders, who currently lack effective real-time mechanisms to control the capture of their picture, video, including their face. We present BlindSpot, an on-device system that enables bystanders to manage their own privacy by signaling their privacy preferences in real-time without previously sharing any sensitive information. Our main contribution is the design and comparative evaluation of three distinct signaling modalities: a hand gesture mechanism, a significantly improved visible light communication (VLC) protocol, and a novel ultra-wideband (UWB) communication protocol. For all these modalities, we also design a validation mechanism that uses geometric consistency checks to verify the origin of a signal relative to the sending bystander, and defend against impersonation attacks. We implement the complete system (BlindSpot) on a commodity smartphone and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each modality's accuracy and latency across various distances, lighting conditions, and user movements. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel bystander signaling techniques and their trade-offs in terms of system performance and convenience.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Interdependent Coupling of Safety and Security for Connected and Automated Vehicles: A Copula-Based Integrated Risk Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety and security are critical to the reliable operation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). While existing research has identified correlations between the two domains, a theoretical framework to analyze their interaction mechanisms and guide co-design remains lacking. To address this gap, this paper proposes a copula-based joint safety-security analysis method to quantify their coupling effects. First, we formulate time-varying cyberattacks using dynamic risk functions derived from survival analysis, while modeling random hardware failures with the Weibull distribution, as per the automotive industry standard ISO 26262. Second, to capture the dependence between functional safety failures and cyber threats, we introduce a joint failure model based on copula theory, employing both elliptical (e.g., Gaussian) and Archimedean (e.g., Frank) copula families to construct a system-level failure function. Furthermore, we provide formal theoretical analysis of the dependence structure in the safety-security coupling, yielding three key insights: (1) a monotonic relationship between joint failure probability and dependence parameters, (2) the mechanisms of defensive response mechanisms (such as patch deployment) in mitigating joint failures, and (3) quantifying the dynamic coupling strength between safety and security under dependence structures. Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the sensitivity of the joint failure behavior to three critical factors: copula dependence parameters, security patch deployment timing, and Weibull distribution parameters. Our dynamic failure model further illustrates how cyberattacks affect safety failures and, conversely, how functional faults affect security failures under dependencies structures. This study provides a quantifiable theoretical foundation for the co-design of safety and security in CAVs.</description>

      <title>One Leak Away: How Pretrained Model Exposure Amplifies Jailbreak Risks in Finetuned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.</description>

      <title>CODE ACROSTIC: Robust Watermarking for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking large language models (LLMs) is vital for preventing their misuse, including the fabrication of fake news, plagiarism, and spam. It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Feature Valuation in Vertical Federated Learning Using Shapley-CMI and PSI Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity skills in new graduates: a Philippine perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the key skills and competencies needed by new cybersecurity graduates in the Philippines for entry-level positions. Using a descriptive cross-sectional research design, it combines analysis of job listings from Philippine online platforms with surveys of students, teachers, and professionals. The aim is to identify required skills and areas needing improvement, highlighting the balance between technical skills and other competencies like ethical conduct, suggesting a shift away from traditional cybersecurity skills towards a more diverse skillset. Furthermore, the results revealed common agreement on the importance of communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills, albeit with slight variations in their prioritization. It recommends that aspiring cybersecurity professionals develop an inclusive skill set encompassing technical knowledge, soft skills, and personal competencies, with a focus on adaptability, continuous learning, and ethics. Skills such as business acumen are considered less vital for entry-level roles, proposing a preparation strategy that aligns with the changing demands of the cybersecurity industry.</description>

      <title>MALCDF: A Distributed Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Real-Time Cyber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional, centralized security tools often miss adaptive, multi-vector attacks. We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings).
  For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records.
  In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.</description>

      <title>Penetration Testing of Agentic AI: A Comparative Security Analysis Across Models and Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Cloud Security Leveraging AI: A Fusion-Based AISOC for Malware and Log Behaviour Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\_CONFIDENCE\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Detection in Internet of Vehicles Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved modern transportation through enhanced connectivity and intelligent systems. However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack patterns including DoS and spoofing attacks targeting critical vehicle parameters such as Spoofing-GAS - gas pedal position, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-Speed, and Spoofing-Steering\_Wheel. Our initial findings confirm a multi-class classification problem with a clear structural difference between attack types and benign data, providing a strong foundation for machine learning models.</description>

      <title>SeBERTis: A Framework for Producing Classifiers of Security-Related Issue Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.</description>

      <title>ScamSweeper: Detecting Illegal Accounts in Web3 Scams via Transactions Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The web3 applications have recently been growing, especially on the Ethereum platform, starting to become the target of scammers. The web3 scams, imitating the services provided by legitimate platforms, mimic regular activity to deceive users. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on de-anonymization and phishing nodes, neglecting the distinctive features of web3 scams. Moreover, the current phishing account detection tools utilize graph learning or sampling algorithms to obtain graph features. However, large-scale transaction networks with temporal attributes conform to a power-law distribution, posing challenges in detecting web3 scams. To overcome these challenges, we present ScamSweeper, a novel framework that emphasizes the dynamic evolution of transaction graphs, to identify web3 scams on Ethereum. ScamSweeper samples the network with a structure temporal random walk, which is an optimized sample walking method that considers both temporal attributes and structural information. Then, the directed graph encoder generates the features of each subgraph during different temporal intervals, sorting as a sequence. Moreover, a variational Transformer is utilized to extract the dynamic evolution in the subgraph sequence. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale transaction dataset consisting of web3 scams, phishing, and normal accounts, which are from the first 18 million block heights on Ethereum. Subsequently, we comprehensively analyze the distinctions in various attributes, including nodes, edges, and degree distribution. Our experiments indicate that ScamSweeper outperforms SIEGE, Ethident, and PDTGA in detecting web3 scams, achieving a weighted F1-score improvement of at least 17.29% with the base value of 0.59. In addition, ScamSweeper in phishing node detection achieves at least a 17.5% improvement over DGTSG and BERT4ETH in F1-score from 0.80.</description>

      <title>RELIC-GNN: Efficient State Registers Identification with Graph Neural Network for Reverse Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse engineering of gate-level netlist is critical for Hardware Trojans detection and Design Piracy counteracting. The primary task of gate-level reverse engineering is to separate the control and data signals from the netlist, which is mainly realized by identifying state registers with topological comparison.However, these methods become inefficient for large scale netlist. In this work, we propose RELIC-GNN, a graph neural network based state registers identification method, to address these issues. RELIC-GNN models the path structure of register as a graph and generates corresponding representation by considering node attributes and graph structure during training. The trained GNN model could be adopted to find the registers type very efficiently. Experimental results show that RELIC-GNN could achieve 100% in recall, 30.49% in precision and 88.37% in accuracy on average across different designs, which obtains significant improvements than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>APT-ClaritySet: A Large-Scale, High-Fidelity Labeled Dataset for APT Malware with Alias Normalization and Graph-Based Deduplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale, standardized datasets for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research are scarce, and inconsistent actor aliases and redundant samples hinder reproducibility. This paper presents APT-ClaritySet and its construction pipeline that normalizes threat actor aliases (reconciling approximately 11.22\% of inconsistent names) and applies graph-feature deduplication -- reducing the subset of statically analyzable executables by 47.55\% while retaining behaviorally distinct variants. APT-ClaritySet comprises: (i) APT-ClaritySet-Full, the complete pre-deduplication collection with 34{,}363 malware samples attributed to 305 APT groups (2006 - early 2025); (ii) APT-ClaritySet-Unique, the deduplicated release with 25{,}923 unique samples spanning 303 groups and standardized attributions; and (iii) APT-ClaritySet-FuncReuse, a function-level resource that includes 324{,}538 function-reuse clusters (FRCs) enabling measurement of inter-/intra-group sharing, evolution, and tooling lineage. By releasing these components and detailing the alias normalization and scalable deduplication pipeline, this work provides a high-fidelity, reproducible foundation for quantitative studies of APT patterns, evolution, and attribution.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Return on Security Controls in LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (&gt;= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).</description>

      <title>Policy-Value Guided MDP-MCTS Framework for Cyber Kill-Chain Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threat analysts routinely rely on natural-language reports that describe attacker actions without enumerating the full kill chain or the dependencies between phases, making automated reconstruction of ATT&amp;CK consistent intrusion paths a difficult open problem. We propose a reasoning framework that infers complete seven-phase kill chains by coupling phase-conditioned semantic priors from Transformer models with a symbolic Markov Decision Process and an AlphaZero-style Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a Policy-Value Network. The framework enforces semantic relevance, phase cohesion, and transition plausibility through a multi-objective reward function while allowing search to explore alternative interpretations of the CTI narrative. Applied to three real intrusions FIN6, APT24, and UNC1549 the approach yields kill chains that surpass Transformer baselines in semantic fidelity and operational coherence, and frequently align with expert-selected TTPs. Our results demonstrate that combining contextual embeddings with search-based decision-making offers a practical path toward automated, interpretable kill-chain reconstruction for cyber defense.</description>

      <title>No More Hidden Pitfalls? Exposing Smart Contract Bad Practices with LLM-Powered Hybrid Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Ethereum platform continues to mature and gain widespread usage, it is crucial to maintain high standards of smart contract writing practices. While bad practices in smart contracts may not directly lead to security issues, they elevate the risk of encountering problems. Therefore, to understand and avoid these bad practices, this paper introduces the first systematic study of bad practices in smart contracts, delving into over 47 specific issues. Specifically, we propose SCALM, an LLM-powered framework featuring two methodological innovations: (1) A hybrid architecture that combines context-aware function-level slicing with knowledge-enhanced semantic reasoning via extensible vectorized pattern matching. (2) A multi-layer reasoning verification system connects low-level code patterns with high-level security principles through syntax, design patterns, and architecture analysis. Our extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and datasets have shown that SCALM outperforms existing tools in detecting bad practices in smart contracts.</description>

      <title>Bounty Hunter: Autonomous, Comprehensive Emulation of Multi-Faceted Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversary emulation is an essential procedure for cybersecurity assessments such as evaluating an organization's security posture or facilitating structured training and research in dedicated environments. To allow for systematic and time-efficient assessments, several approaches from academia and industry have worked towards the automation of adversarial actions. However, they exhibit significant limitations regarding autonomy, tactics coverage, and real-world applicability. Consequently, adversary emulation remains a predominantly manual task requiring substantial human effort and security expertise - even amidst the rise of Large Language Models. In this paper, we present Bounty Hunter, an automated adversary emulation method, designed and implemented as an open-source plugin for the popular adversary emulation platform Caldera, that enables autonomous emulation of adversaries with multi-faceted behavior while providing a wide coverage of tactics. To this end, it realizes diverse adversarial behavior, such as different levels of detectability and varying attack paths across repeated emulations. By autonomously compromising a simulated enterprise network, Bounty Hunter showcases its ability to achieve given objectives without prior knowledge of its target, including pre-compromise, initial compromise, and post-compromise attack tactics. Overall, Bounty Hunter facilitates autonomous, comprehensive, and multi-faceted adversary emulation to help researchers and practitioners in performing realistic and time-efficient security assessments, training exercises, and intrusion detection research.</description>

      <title>Talking to the Airgap: Exploiting Radio-Less Embedded Devices as Radio Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent electronics are deeply embedded in critical infrastructures and must remain reliable, particularly against deliberate attacks. To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software.
  Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation. [shortened]</description>

      <title>Packed Malware Detection Using Grayscale Binary-to-Image Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting packed executables is a critical step in malware analysis, as packing obscures the original code and complicates static inspection. This study evaluates both classical feature-based methods and deep learning approaches that transform binary executables into visual representations, specifically, grayscale byte plots, and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of packed and non-packed binaries. A diverse dataset of benign and malicious Portable Executable (PE) files, packed using various commercial and open-source packers, was curated to capture a broad spectrum of packing transformations and obfuscation techniques. Classical models using handcrafted Gabor jet features achieved intense discrimination at moderate computational cost. In contrast, CNNs based on VGG16 and DenseNet121 significantly outperformed them, achieving high detection performance with well-balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores. DenseNet121 demonstrated slightly higher precision and lower false positive rates, whereas VGG16 achieved marginally higher recall, indicating complementary strengths for practical deployment. Evaluation against unknown packers confirmed robust generalization, demonstrating that grayscale byte-plot representations combined with deep learning provide a useful and reliable approach for early detection of packed malware, enhancing malware analysis pipelines and supporting automated antivirus inspection.</description>

      <title>Attention in Motion: Secure Platooning via Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.</description>

      <title>Time will Tell: Large-scale De-anonymization of Hidden I2P Services via Live Behavior Alignment (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is a popular anonymous communication network. While existing de-anonymization methods for I2P focus on identifying potential traffic patterns of target hidden services among extensive network traffic, they often fail to scale effectively across the large and diverse I2P network, which consists of numerous routers. In this paper, we introduce I2PERCEPTION a low-cost approach revealing the IP addresses of I2P hidden services. In I2PERCEPTION, attackers deploy floodfill routers to passively monitor I2P routers and collect their RouterInfo. We analyze the router information publication mechanism to accurately identify routers' join (i.e. on) and leave (i.e. off) behaviors, enabling fine-grained live behavior inference across the I2P network. Active probing is used to obtain the live behavior (i.e., on-off patterns) of a target hidden service hosted on one of the I2P routers. By correlating the live behaviors of the target hidden service and I2P routers over time, we narrow down the set of routers matching the hidden service's behavior, revealing the hidden service's true network identity for de-anonymization. Through the deployment of only 15 floodfill routers over the course of eight months, we validate the precision and effectiveness of our approach with extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that I2PERCEPTION successfully de-anonymizes all controlled hidden services.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has turned models into highly valuable assets due to their reliance on massive data and costly training processes. However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often fail to better balance covertness (hiding the watermark to prevent detection and forgery) and robustness (ensuring the watermark resists removal)-two essential properties for real-world copyright verification. In this paper, we propose ComMark, a novel black-box model watermarking framework that leverages frequency-domain transformations to generate compressed, covert, and attack-resistant watermark samples by filtering out high-frequency information. To further enhance watermark robustness, our method incorporates simulated attack scenarios and a similarity loss during training. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that ComMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covertness and robustness. Furthermore, we extend its applicability beyond image recognition to tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, image generation, image captioning, and video recognition, underscoring its versatility and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Distributed HDMM: Scalable, Distributed, Accurate, and Differentially Private Query Workloads without a Trusted Curator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Distributed High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (Distributed HDMM), a protocol for answering workloads of linear queries on distributed data that provides the accuracy of central-model HDMM without a trusted curator. Distributed HDMM leverages a secure aggregation protocol to evaluate HDMM on distributed data, and is secure in the context of a malicious aggregator and malicious clients (assuming an honest majority). Our preliminary empirical evaluation shows that Distributed HDMM can run on realistic datasets and workloads with thousands of clients in less than one minute.</description>

      <title>BashArena: A Control Setting for Highly Privileged AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future AI agents might run autonomously with elevated privileges. If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments. BashArena contains 637 Linux system administration and infrastructure engineering tasks in complex, realistic environments, along with four sabotage objectives (execute malware, exfiltrate secrets, escalate privileges, and disable firewall) for a red team to target. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs on their ability to complete tasks, perform sabotage undetected, and detect sabotage attempts. Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR. Our findings provide a baseline for designing more effective control protocols in BashArena. We release the dataset as a ControlArena setting and share our task generation pipeline.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Analysis of Low-Round Keccak/SHA-3 Preimage Attack: From Classical 2^57.8 to Quantum 2^28.9 using Qiskit Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-conscious analysis of the quantum acceleration of the classical 3-round Keccak-256 preimage attack using Grover's Algorithm. While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Gradient-Based Inference Attack for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.</description>

Abstract: The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up. An alternative, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), has recently emerged, making use of computations based on quantum mechanics. It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>

      <title>Bits for Privacy: Evaluating Post-Training Quantization via Membership Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Remotely Detectable Robot Policy Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.</description>

      <title>Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.</description>

      <title>How Do Semantically Equivalent Code Transformations Impact Membership Inference on LLMs for Code?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.
  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</description>

      <title>FAME: FPGA Acceleration of Secure Matrix Multiplication with Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, addressing privacy concerns in cloud computing. However, the high computational cost of HE operations, particularly matrix multiplication (MM), remains a major barrier to its practical deployment. Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning.
  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes. Experimental results show that FAME achieves an average speedup of 221x over state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, demonstrating its scalability and practicality for large-scale consecutive HE MM and real-world workloads.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Resilient Signatures for Cloud-Assisted Embedded IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with non-repudiation and are vital tools for the Internet of Things (IoT). Many IoT applications harbor vast quantities of resource-limited devices often used with cloud computing. However, key compromises (e.g., physical, malware) pose a significant threat to IoTs due to increased attack vectors and open operational environments. Forward security and distributed key management are critical breach-resilient countermeasures to mitigate such threats. Yet forward-secure signatures are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoTs, while cloud-assisted approaches suffer from centrality or non-colluding semi-honest servers. In this work, we create two novel digital signatures called Lightweight and Resilient Signatures with Hardware Assistance (LRSHA) and its Forward-secure version (FLRSHA). They offer a near-optimally efficient signing with small keys and signature sizes. We synergize various design strategies, such as commitment separation to eliminate costly signing operations and hardware-assisted distributed servers to enable breach-resilient verification. Our schemes achieve magnitudes of faster forward-secure signing and compact key/signature sizes without suffering from strong security assumptions (non-colluding, central servers) or a heavy burden on the verifier (extreme storage, computation). We formally prove the security of our schemes and validate their performance with full-fledged open-source implementations on both commodity hardware and 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.</description>

      <title>Convergent Privacy Framework for Multi-layer GNNs through Contractive Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has been integrated into graph neural networks (GNNs) to protect sensitive structural information, e.g., edges, nodes, and associated features across various applications. A prominent approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (e.g., GAP published in Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when multi-layer GNNs, which have shown better performance than one-layer GNN, are used to process graph data with sensitive information. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget converges with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior performance in privacy auditing tasks.</description>

Abstract: Kubernetes Operators, automated tools designed to manage application lifecycles within Kubernetes clusters, extend the functionalities of Kubernetes, and reduce the operational burden on human engineers. While Operators significantly simplify DevOps workflows, they introduce new security risks. In particular, Kubernetes enforces namespace isolation to separate workloads and limit user access, ensuring that users can only interact with resources within their authorized namespaces. However, Kubernetes Operators often demand elevated privileges and may interact with resources across multiple namespaces. This introduces a new class of vulnerabilities, the Cross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability. The root cause lies in the mismatch between the declared scope of resources and the implemented scope of the Operator logic, resulting in Kubernetes being unable to properly isolate the namespace. Leveraging such vulnerability, an adversary with limited access to a single authorized namespace may exploit the Operator to perform operations affecting other unauthorized namespaces, causing Privilege Escalation and further impacts.
  To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically investigate Kubernetes Operator attacks. We present Cross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability with two strategies, demonstrating how an attacker can bypass namespace isolation. Through large-scale measurements, we found that over 14% of Operators in the wild are potentially vulnerable. Our findings have been reported to the relevant developers, resulting in 8 confirmations and 7 CVEs by the time of submission, affecting vendors including Red Hat and NVIDIA, highlighting the critical need for enhanced security practices in Kubernetes Operators. To mitigate it, we open-source the static analysis suite and propose concrete mitigation to benefit the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Taming Data Challenges in ML-based Security Tasks: Lessons from Integrating Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI) address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples). Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI tools designed for security tasks.</description>

      <title>May I have your Attention? Breaking Fine-Tuning based Prompt Injection Defenses using Architecture-Aware Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning to separate instructions and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present with data. We evaluate the robustness of this approach in the whitebox setting by constructing strong optimization-based attacks, and show that the defenses do not provide the claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based attack algorithm for textual LLMs and apply it to three recent whitebox defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025), SecAlign++, and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks with success rates of up to \textbf{85-95\%} on unseen prompts with modest increase in attacker budget in terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</description>

      <title>The Trojan Knowledge: Bypassing Commercial LLM Guardrails via Harmless Prompt Weaving and Adaptive Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Existing approaches overwhelmingly operate within the prompt-optimization paradigm: whether through traditional algorithmic search or recent agent-based workflows, the resulting prompts typically retain malicious semantic signals that modern guardrails are primed to detect. In contrast, we identify a deeper, largely overlooked vulnerability stemming from the highly interconnected nature of an LLM's internal knowledge. This structure allows harmful objectives to be realized by weaving together sequences of benign sub-queries, each of which individually evades detection. To exploit this loophole, we introduce the Correlated Knowledge Attack Agent (CKA-Agent), a dynamic framework that reframes jailbreaking as an adaptive, tree-structured exploration of the target model's knowledge base. The CKA-Agent issues locally innocuous queries, uses model responses to guide exploration across multiple paths, and ultimately assembles the aggregated information to achieve the original harmful objective. Evaluated across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (Gemini2.5-Flash/Pro, GPT-oss-120B, Claude-Haiku-4.5), CKA-Agent consistently achieves over 95% success rates even against strong guardrails, underscoring the severity of this vulnerability and the urgent need for defenses against such knowledge-decomposition attacks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/CKA-Agent.</description>

      <title>Verification of Lightning Network Channel Balances with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the private liquidity state of Lightning Network (LN) channels is desirable for auditors, service providers, and network participants who need assurance of financial capacity. Current methods often lack robustness against a malicious or compromised node operator. This paper introduces a methodology for the verification of LN channel balances. The core contribution is a framework that combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS) to provide strong, hardware-backed guarantees. In our proposed method, the node's balance-reporting software runs within a TEE, which generates a remote attestation quote proving the software's integrity. This attestation is then served via an Application Programming Interface (API), and zkTLS is used to prove the authenticity of its delivery. We also analyze an alternative variant where the TEE signs the report directly without zkTLS, discussing the trade-offs between transport-layer verification and direct enclave signing. We further refine this by distinguishing between "Hot Proofs" (verifiable claims via TEEs) and "Cold Proofs" (on-chain settlement), and discuss critical security considerations including hardware vulnerabilities, privacy leakage to third-party APIs, and the performance overhead of enclaved operations.</description>

      <title>Enigma: Application-Layer Privacy for Quantum Optimization on Untrusted Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Early Fault-Tolerant (EFT) era is emerging, where modest Quantum Error Correction (QEC) can enable quantum utility before full-scale fault tolerance. Quantum optimization is a leading candidate for early applications, but protecting these workloads is critical since they will run on expensive cloud services where providers could learn sensitive problem details. Experience with classical computing systems has shown that treating security as an afterthought can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Thus, we must address the security implications of quantum computing before widespread adoption. However, current Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) approaches, although theoretically promising, are impractical in the EFT era: blind quantum computing requires large-scale quantum networks, and quantum homomorphic encryption depends on full QEC.
  We propose application-specific SQC, a principle that applies obfuscation at the application layer to enable practical deployment while remaining agnostic to algorithms, computing models, and hardware architectures. We present Enigma, the first realization of this principle for quantum optimization. Enigma integrates three complementary obfuscations: ValueGuard scrambles coefficients, StructureCamouflage inserts decoys, and TopologyTrimmer prunes variables. These techniques guarantee recovery of original solutions, and their stochastic nature resists repository-matching attacks. Evaluated against seven state-of-the-art AI models across five representative graph families, even combined adversaries, under a conservatively strong attacker model, identify the correct problem within their top five guesses in only 4.4% of cases. The protections come at the cost of problem size and T-gate counts increasing by averages of 1.07x and 1.13x, respectively, with both obfuscation and decoding completing within seconds for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on the Cloud Computing Risk Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how geopolitical tensions catalyze IT risk evolution through systematic analysis of the conflict's impact on data sovereignty, cybersecurity paradigms, and cloud infrastructure strategies. Using a structured qualitative synthesis methodology, we analyzed 68 sources including threat reports, regulatory documents, and policy analyses from 2022-2025. Our findings reveal a 48% increase in cyber incidents during 2024, accelerated data localization across more than 40 countries, and growing sovereign cloud adoption. We propose a validated multi-layered framework integrating resilient architectures, data-centric security, and geopolitically-informed governance. The framework addresses gaps in traditional IT risk management by incorporating state-sponsored threat considerations and human element vulnerabilities. Key contributions include empirical evidence of geopolitical risk acceleration, a practical implementation framework with measurable outcomes, and concrete guidance for organizations navigating digital sovereignty challenges.</description>

      <title>Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile exact verifier for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) and biochemical datasets (MUTAG and ENZYMES) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance for node classification and competitiveness on graph classification compared to existing exact verification tools on sum-aggregated GNNs.</description>

      <title>From Trace to Line: LLM Agent for Real-World OSS Vulnerability Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and focus on coarse function or file level detections which offers limited actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent (Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses run-time evidence such as crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.</description>
