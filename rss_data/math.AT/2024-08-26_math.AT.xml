      <title>Pontryagin duality and sheaves of profinite modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known theory of Pontryagin duality provides a strong connection between the homology and cohomology theories of a profinite group in appropriate categories. A construction for taking the `profinite direct sum' of an infinite family of profinite modules indexed over a profinite space has been found to be useful in the study of homology of profinite groups, but hitherto the appropriate dual construction for studying cohomology with coefficients in discrete modules has not been studied. This paper remedies this gap in the theory.</description>

      <title>Dowker duality, profunctors, and spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intent of this paper is to explore Dowker duality from a combinatorial, topological, and categorical perspective. The paper presents three short, new proofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce modifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational join and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be constructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which includes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In this more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial complexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence. Similar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations of relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role of the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that arise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly, we show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph form a long exact sequence. We make use of a spectral sequence for Grothendieck fibrations of small categories.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of ``virtual morphisms'' in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.
  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</description>

      <title>Homological approximations in persistence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a class of invariants, which we call homological invariants, for persistence modules over a finite poset. Informally, a homological invariant is one that respects some homological data and takes values in the free abelian group generated by a finite set of indecomposable modules. We focus in particular on groups generated by "spread modules", which are sometimes called "interval modules" in the persistence theory literature. We show that both the dimension vector and rank invariant are equivalent to homological invariants taking values in groups generated by spread modules. We also show that the free abelian group generated by the "single-source" spread modules gives rise to a new invariant which is finer than the rank invariant. They are also thankful to an anonymous referee for their thorough reading of this paper and suggestions for improvement.</description>

      <title>The Macias topology on integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript a recent topology on the positive integers generated by the collection of $\{\sigma_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ where $\sigma_n:=\{m: \gcd(n,m)=1\}$ is generalized over integral domains. Some of its topological properties are studied. Properties of this topology on infinite principal ideal domains that are not fields are also explored, and a new topological proof of the infinitude of prime elements is obtained (assuming the set of units is finite or not open), different from those presented in the style of H. Furstenberg. Finally, some problems are proposed.</description>
