      <title>Can Recombination Displace Dominant Scientific Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific breakthroughs are widely attributed to the novel recombination of existing ideas. Yet despite explosive global growth in scientific labor and publications -- creating more opportunities to reconfigure knowledge -- the rate of breakthroughs has not kept pace. To investigate this disconnect, we analyze 49 million scholarly works from 1960 to 2024 using measures of atypical recombination and disruptive innovation. Contrary to recombination theories, we find a robust negative correlation between atypicality and disruption -- consistent across fields, time, team sizes, and even across versions of the same paper. Interviews with scientists about landmark breakthroughs suggest an alternative mechanism of innovation: displacement, in which nearly all breakthroughs supplanted dominant ideas within their fields. Bibliometric evidence confirms this pattern, showing that disruptive work often overlap in topic with its most-cited reference, indicating that breakthroughs emerge through within -- field displacement rather than cross-domain recombination. Notably, displacing methods takes longer than displacing theories -- revealing different temporal dynamics of epistemic change.</description>

      <title>From Data to Decision: Data-Centric Infrastructure for Reproducible ML in Collaborative eScience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML), especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data, features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented, relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools. This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts: Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions, enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across the ML lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Web Archives Metadata Generation with GPT-4o: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current metadata creation for web archives is time consuming and costly due to reliance on human effort. This paper explores the use of gpt-4o for metadata generation within the Web Archive Singapore, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. We processed 112 Web ARChive (WARC) files using data reduction techniques, achieving a notable 99.9% reduction in metadata generation costs. By prompt engineering, we generated titles and abstracts, which were evaluated both intrinsically using Levenshtein Distance and BERTScore, and extrinsically with human cataloguers using McNemar's test. Results indicate that while our method offers significant cost savings and efficiency gains, human curated metadata maintains an edge in quality. The study identifies key challenges including content inaccuracies, hallucinations, and translation issues, suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) should serve as complements rather than replacements for human cataloguers. Future work will focus on refining prompts, improving content filtering, and addressing privacy concerns through experimentation with smaller models. This research advances the integration of LLMs in web archiving, offering valuable insights into their current capabilities and outlining directions for future enhancements. The code is available at https://github.com/masamune-prog/warc2summary for further development and use by institutions facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Gaming the Metrics? Bibliometric Anomalies and the Integrity Crisis in Global University Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global university rankings have reshaped how academic success is defined, incentivizing metrics such as publication counts and citation rates at the expense of scholarly integrity. This study examines 18 universities in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, selected from among the world's 1,000 most-publishing institutions for their extraordinary research growth and sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. These institutions exhibit bibliometric patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization, including publication surges of up to 965%, a proliferation of hyper-prolific authors, dense reciprocal co-authorship and citation networks, elevated shares of output in delisted journals, and rising retraction rates. These patterns are analyzed in light of Goodhart's Law and institutional isomorphism, illustrating how performance pressures can reshape academic behavior. To systematically assess and monitor such risks, the study introduces the Research Integrity Risk Index (RI2), a composite indicator based on retraction rates and reliance on delisted journals. RI2 effectively identifies institutions with bibliometric profiles that diverge from global norms and may warrant closer examination. The findings highlight the urgent need for integrity-sensitive reforms in how rankings, funders, and institutions assess scholarly performance.</description>

      <title>Linking Data Citation to Repository Visibility: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's data-driven research landscape, dataset visibility and accessibility play a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge. At the same time, data citation is essential for maintaining academic integrity, acknowledging contributions, validating research outcomes, and fostering scientific reproducibility. As a critical link, it connects scholarly publications with the datasets that drive scientific progress. This study investigates whether repository visibility influences data citation rates. We hypothesize that repositories with higher visibility, as measured by search engine metrics, are associated with increased dataset citations. Using OpenAlex data and repository impact indicators (including the visibility index from Sistrix, the h-index of repositories, and citation metrics such as mean and median citations), we analyze datasets in Social Sciences and Economics to explore their relationship. Our findings suggest that datasets hosted on more visible web domains tend to receive more citations, with a positive correlation observed between web domain visibility and dataset citation counts, particularly for datasets with at least one citation. However, when analyzing domain-level citation metrics, such as the h-index, mean, and median citations, the correlations are inconsistent and weaker. While higher visibility domains tend to host datasets with greater citation impact, the distribution of citations across datasets varies significantly. These results suggest that while visibility plays a role in increasing citation counts, it is not the sole factor influencing dataset citation impact. Other elements, such as dataset quality, research trends, and disciplinary norms, can also contribute to citation patterns.</description>
