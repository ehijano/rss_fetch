      <title>Drone Controller Localization Based on TDoA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time difference of arrival (TDoA)-based algorithms for drone controller localization and analyze TDoA estimation in multipath channels. Building on TDoA estimation, we propose two algorithms to enhance localization accuracy in multipath environments: the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and the Least Squares Bancroft with Gauss-Newton (LS-BF-GN) algorithm. We evaluate these proposed algorithms in two typical outdoor channels: Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Channel F and the two-ray ground reflection (TRGR) channel. Our simulation results demonstrate that the ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms significantly outperform the LS-BF algorithm in multipath channels. To further enhance localization accuracy, we propose averaging multiple tentative location estimations. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of time synchronization errors among sensors on localization performance through simulation.</description>

      <title>Anti-Jamming Modulation for OFDM Systems under Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers, enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver, we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method. Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.</description>

      <title>Engineering Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the reasons complex systems are complex is because they have multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue that it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the system's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the level of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many systems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small subset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the theory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions across the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single path that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be classified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent hierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the scales of a system) than the standard network science terminology. More broadly, we provide the mathematical tools to quantify this complexity and provide diverse examples of the taxonomy of emergent hierarchies. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to engineer not just degree of emergence in a system, but how that emergence is distributed across the multiscale structure.</description>

      <title>Robust Segmented Analog Broadcast Design to Accelerate Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider downlink broadcast design for federated learning (FL) in a wireless network with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to reduce transmission latency, we propose a segmented analog broadcast (SegAB) scheme, where the parameter server, hosted by a multi-antenna base station, partitions the global model parameter vector into segments and transmits multiple parameters from these segments simultaneously over a common downlink channel. We formulate the SegAB transmission and reception processes to characterize FL training convergence, capturing the effects of downlink beamforming and imperfect CSI. To maximize the FL training convergence rate, we establish an upper bound on the expected model optimality gap and show that it can be minimized separately over the training rounds in online optimization, without requiring knowledge of the future channel states. We solve the per-round problem to achieve robust downlink beamforming, by minimizing the worst-case objective via an epigraph representation and a feasibility subproblem that ensures monotone convergence. Simulation with standard classification tasks under typical wireless network setting shows that the proposed SegAB substantially outperforms conventional full-model per-parameter broadcast and other alternatives.</description>

      <title>Symbol Timing Synchronization and Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things (AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity. Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR. Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates the BER performance degradation caused by STO.</description>

      <title>Transport of Event Equation: Phase Retrieval from Defocus Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs on the volume of fault-tolerant circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings. However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of the One-Sided Code Sparsifier Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of code sparsification was introduced by Khanna, Putterman and Sudan (arxiv.2311.00788), as an analogue to the the more established notion of cut sparsification in graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, for $\alpha\in (0,1)$ an (unweighted) one-sided $\alpha$-sparsifier for a linear code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ such that the weight of each codeword projected onto the coordinates in $S$ is preserved up to an $\alpha$ fraction. Recently, Gharan and Sahami (arxiv.2502.02799) show the existence of one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers of size $n/2+O(\sqrt{kn})$ for any linear code, where $k$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we consider the computational problem of finding a one-sided 1/2-sparsifier of minimal size, and show that it is NP-hard, via a reduction from the classical nearest codeword problem. We also show hardness of approximation results.</description>

      <title>An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing, collision bounds, security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.</description>

      <title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</description>

      <title>Pioneering Scalable Prototyping for Mid-Band XL-MIMO Systems: Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems, the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems, posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements, and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12 users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of 15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80 bit/s/Hz.</description>

      <title>Universal classical-quantum channel resolvability and private channel coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks.
  Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of the merging of opinions, along the lines of the Blackwell-Dubins Theorem. After setting up a general framework for defining notions of merging randomness, we focus on finite horizon events, that is, on weak merging in the sense of Kalai-Lehrer. In contrast to Blackwell-Dubins and Kalai-Lehrer, we consider not only the total variational distance but also the Hellinger distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our main result is a characterization of Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of weak merging and the summable Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main proof idea is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $\mu$ and $\nu$, at a given stage of the learning process, is exactly the incremental growth, at that stage, of the predictable process of the Doob decomposition of the $\nu$-submartingale $L(\sigma)=-\ln \frac{\mu(\sigma)}{\nu(\sigma)}$. These characterizations of algorithmic randomness notions in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be viewed as global analogues of Vovk's theorem on what transpires locally with individual Martin-L\"of $\mu$- and $\nu$-random points and the Hellinger distance between $\mu,\nu$.</description>

      <title>Information storage and transmission under Markovian noise</title>

Abstract: We study the information transmission capacities of quantum Markov semigroups $(\Psi^t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}$ acting on $d-$dimensional quantum systems. We show that, in the limit of $t\to \infty$, the capacities can be efficiently computed in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of $\Psi$, are strongly additive, and satisfy the strong converse property. We also establish convergence bounds to show that the infinite-time capacities are reached after time $t\gtrsim d^2\ln (d)$. From a data storage perspective, our analysis provides tight bounds on the number of bits or qubits that can be reliably stored for long times in a quantum memory device that is experiencing Markovian noise. From a practical standpoint, we show that typically, an $n-$qubit quantum memory, with Markovian noise acting independently and identically on all qubits and a fixed time-independent global error correction mechanism, becomes useless for storage after time $t\gtrsim n2^{2n}$. In contrast, if the error correction is local, we prove that the memory becomes useless much more quickly, i.e., after time $t\gtrsim \ln(n)$. In the setting of point-to-point communication between two spatially separated parties, our analysis provides efficiently computable bounds on the optimal rate at which bits or qubits can be reliably transmitted via long Markovian communication channels $(\Psi^l)_{l\in \mathbb{N}}$ of length $l\gtrsim d^2 \ln(d)$, both in the finite block-length and asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-aided Task-oriented Semantic Communications with Model Inversion Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication enhances transmission efficiency by conveying semantic information rather than raw input symbol sequences. Task-oriented semantic communication is a variant that tries to retains only task-specific information, thus achieving greater bandwidth savings. However, these neural-based communication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks, where adversaries try to infer sensitive input information from eavesdropped transmitted data. The key challenge, therefore, lies in preserving privacy while ensuring transmission correctness and robustness. While prior studies typically assume that adversaries aim to fully reconstruct the raw input in task-oriented settings, there exist scenarios where pixel-level metrics such as PSNR or SSIM are low, yet the adversary's outputs still suffice to accomplish the downstream task, indicating leakage of sensitive information. We therefore adopt the attacker's task accuracy as a more appropriate metric for evaluating attack effectiveness. To optimize the gap between the legitimate receiver's accuracy and the adversary's accuracy, we propose DiffSem, a diffusion-aided framework for task-oriented semantic communication. DiffSem integrates a transmitter-side self-noising mechanism that adaptively regulates semantic content while compensating for channel noise, and a receiver-side diffusion U-Net that enhances task performance and can be optionally strengthened by self-referential label embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffSem enables the legitimate receiver to achieve higher accuracy, thereby validating the superior performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>
