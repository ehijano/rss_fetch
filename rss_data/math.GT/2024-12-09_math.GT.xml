      <title>Bridge Positions of Links That Cannot Be Monotonically Simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any pair of integers $m$ and $n$ such that $3&lt;m&lt;n$, we provide an infinite family of links, where each link in the family has a locally minimal $n$-bridge position and a globally minimal $m$-bridge position. We accomplish this by applying the criterion of Takao et al. The $n$-bridge position is interesting because the corresponding bridge sphere is unperturbed, so it must be perturbed at least once before it can be de-perturbed to attain a globally minimal $m$-bridge sphere.</description>

      <title>Small Triangulations of $4$-Manifolds: Introducing the $4$-Manifold Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to classify PL-types of large censuses of triangulated $4$-manifolds, which we use to classify the PL-types of all triangulated $4$-manifolds with up to $6$ pentachora. This is successful except for triangulations homeomorphic to the $4$-sphere, $\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the rational homology sphere $QS^4(2)$, where we find at most four, three, and two PL-types respectively. We conjecture that they are all standard. In addition, we look at the cases resisting classification and discuss the combinatorial structure of these triangulations -- which we deem interesting in their own rights.</description>

      <title>A note on the X-torsion order of a knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $X$-torsion order of a knot, which is defined in terms of a generalised Lee complex, can be calculated using the reduced Bar-Natan--Lee--Turner spectral sequence. We use this for extensive calculations, including an example of $X$-torsion order $4$.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity witnessed by Dehn fillings of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any profinite isomorphism between two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds carries profinite isomorphisms between their Dehn fillings. With this observation, we prove that some cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds are profinitely rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through detecting their exceptional Dehn fillings. In addition, we improved a criteria for profinite rigidity of a hyperbolic knot complement or a hyperbolic-type satellite knot complement among compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through examining its characterising slopes. We obtain the following profinitely rigid examples: the complement of the Whitehead link, Whitehead sister link, $\frac{3}{10}$ two-bridge link; specific surgeries on one component of these links; the complement of (full) twist knots $\mathcal{K}_n$, Eudave-Mu\~noz knots $K(3,1,n,0)$, Pretzel knots $P(-3,3,2n+1)$, $5_2$ knot; the Berge manifold, and many more.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and finite domination in stratified homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study compactness and finiteness of an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a conservative functor to a finite poset $P$. We provide sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be compact in terms of strata and homotopy links of $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow P$. Analogous conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be finite are also given. From these, we deduce that, if $X\rightarrow P$ is a conically stratified space with the property that the weak homotopy type of its strata, and of strata of its local links, are compact (respectively finite) $\infty$-groupoids, then $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is compact (respectively finite). This gives a positive answer to a question of Porta and Teyssier. If $X\rightarrow P$ is equipped with a conically smooth structure (e.g. a Whitney stratification), we show that $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is finite if and only the weak homotopy types of the strata of $X\rightarrow P$ are finite. The aforementioned characterization relies on the finiteness of $\text{Exit}_P(X)$, when $X\rightarrow P$ is compact and conically smooth. We conclude our paper by showing that the analogous statement does not hold in the topological category. More explicitly, we provide an example of a compact $C^0$-stratified space whose exit paths $\infty$-category is compact, but not finite. This stratified space was constructed by Quinn. We also observe that this provides a non-trivial example of a $C^0$-stratified space which does not admit any conically smooth structure.</description>

      <title>The Vol-Det Conjecture for highly twisted alternating links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vol-Det Conjecture, formulated by Champanerkar, Kofman and Purcell, states that there exists a specific inequality connecting the hyperbolic volume of an alternating link and its determinant. Among the classes of links for which this conjecture holds are all alternating hyperbolic knots with at most 16 crossings, 2-bridge links, and links that are closures of 3-strand braids. In the present paper, Burton's bound on the number of crossings for which the Vol-Det Conjecture holds is improved for links with more than eight twists. In addition, Stoimenow's inequalities between hyperbolic volumes and determinants are improved for alternating and alternating arborescent links with more than eight twists.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Surplusection Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose you have a family of Lagrangian submanifolds $L_t$ and an auxiliary Lagrangian $K$. Suppose that $K$ intersects some of the $L_t$ more than the minimal number of times. Can you eliminate surplus intersection (surplusection) with all fibres by performing a Hamiltonian isotopy of $K$? Or will any Lagrangian isotopic to $K$ surplusect some of the fibres? We argue that in several important situations, surplusection cannot be eliminated, and that a better understanding of surplusection phenomena (better bounds and a clearer understanding of how the surplusection is distributed in the family) would help to tackle some outstanding problems in different areas, including Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and the concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open questions.</description>
