      <title>Homogeneous O-operators on BiHom-Jordan superalgebras and BiHom-pre-Jordan superalgebras structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we recall the notion of BiHom-generalization of Jordan superalgebras called BiHom-Jordan superalgebras in which, we investigate their representation and associated dual representation theory. We also introduce the notion of homogeneous O-operators of BiHom-Jordan superalgebra associated to a given representation. Additionnaly we define the BiHom-pre-Jordan superalgebras structures, in which we study the relationship between BiHom-pre-Jordan superalgebras and BiHom-Jordan superalgebras via a homogeneous O-operators. Some other related results are considered.</description>

      <title>A constructive counterpart of the subdirect representation theorem for reduced rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a constructive counterpart of the theorem of Andrunakievi\v{c} and Rjabuhin, which states that every reduced ring is a subdirect product of domains. As an application, we extract a constructive proof of the fact that every ring $A$ satisfying $\forall x\in A. x^3=x$ is commutative from a classical proof. We also prove a similar result for semiprime ideals.</description>

      <title>EAQEC codes from s-Galois hulls decomposition of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes are a subclass of quantum error-correcting codes which use entanglement as a resource. These codes can provide error correction capability higher than the codes derived from the traditional stabilizer formalism. In this paper, we first give a s-Galois hulls decomposition of linear codes over finite fields. By means of this decomposition, we provide a method to construct EAQEC codes. Using this method, we construct new EAQEC codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sets of planes in an even dimensional real vector space $V$ which are simultaneously stabilised by a pair of complex structures on $V$. We completely describe these sets of planes for pairs of orthogonal complex structures. Generically, the number of such planes is finite. We compute this number for orthogonal complex structures and prove that it gives a lower bound for the number of planes simultaneously stabilised by a generic pair of complex structures on $V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the automorphisms and derivations for abelian extensions of associative 2-algebras. We investigate the inducibility of a pair of automorphisms for associative 2-algebras and construct a Wells exact sequence. We consider a similar study for derivations of associative 2-algebras and their applications. Finally, we investigate the special case of crossed modules over associative algebras.</description>

      <title>On Bott--Samelson rings for Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology ring of the Bott--Samelson variety. We compute an explicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it is a combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the Bott--Samelson ring associated with a word in arbitrary Coxeter system by generators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete intersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of Tate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic (reduced) Gr{\"o}bner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole K\"ahler package, including the Poincar\'e duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations.</description>

      <title>A Relational Category of Birkhoff Polarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Garret Birkhoff observed that any binary relation between two sets determines a Galois connection between the powersets, or equivalently, closure operators on the powersets, or equivalently, complete lattices of subsets that are dually isomorphic. Referring to the duality of, say, points and lines in projective geometry, he named the binary relations as polarities.
  Researchers since then have used polarities (also known as formal contexts) as a convenient technical way to build complete lattices from ``found'' data. And so, various proposals for suitable morphisms between polarities have tended to have a particular application in mind.
  In this work, we develop the structure of a category of polarities and compatible relations, adopting Birkhoff's original simple idea that the structure of a polarity is its the Galois connection. Hence, morphisms must be relations that, in a reasonable sense, preserve Galois connections. In particular, the dual equivalence of the category to the category of complete meet semilattices, completeness of the category, characterization of epimorphisms and monomorphisms, an epi/mono factorization system, as well as the star-autonomous structure of the category, all arise by extending Birkhoff's original observation to morphisms.</description>

      <title>Matrix structure of classical ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded algebra $\mathfrak g$ with a bracket $[|. , . |]$ that satisfies certain graded versions of the symmetry and Jacobi identity. In particular, despite the common terminology, $\mathfrak g$ is not a Lie algebra. We construct classes of ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebras corresponding to the classical Lie algebras, in terms of their defining matrices. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $A$, the construction coincides with the previously known class. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $B$, $C$ and $D$ our construction is new and gives rise to interesting defining matrices closely related to the classical ones but undoubtedly different. We also give some examples and possible applications to parastatistics.</description>

      <title>On Gauge Equivalence of Twisted Quantum Doubles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum double of a finite abelian group $G$ twisted by a $3$-cocycle and give a sufficient condition when such a twisted quantum double will be gauge equivalent to a ordinary quantum double of a finite group. Moreover, we will determine when a twisted quantum double of a cyclic group is genuine. As an application, we contribute to the classification of coradically graded finite-dimensional pointed coquasi-Hopf algebras over abelian groups. As a byproduct, we show that the Nichols algebras $\mathcal{B}(M_1\oplus M_2 \oplus M_3)$ are infinite-dimensional where $M_1,M_2,M_3$ are three different simple Yetter-Drinfeld modules of $D_8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that shift equivalence of essential adjacency matrices coincides with gauge-equivariant homotopy equivalence of their stabilized graph C*-algebras. This provide the first equivalent formulation of shift equivalence of essential matrices in terms of gauge actions on graph C*-algebras. Our proof uses bicategory theory for C*-bimodules developed by Meyer and Sehnem, allowing us to avoid the use of K-theory classification of C*-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we start with a class of quivers containing only 2-cycles and loops, referred to as 2-cyclic quivers. We prove that there exists a potential on these quivers that ensures the resulting quiver with potential is Jacobian-finite. As an application, we first demonstrate through covering theory that a Jacobian-finite potential exists on a class of 2-acyclic quivers. Secondly, by using the 2-cyclic Caldero-Chapoton formula defined on section 4.2, the $\tau$-rigid modules obtained from the Jacobian algebras of our proven Jacobian-finite 2-cyclic quiver with potential can categorify Paquette-Schiffler's generalized cluster algebras in three specific cases: one for a disk with two marked points and one 3-puncture, one for a sphere with one puncture, one 3-puncture and one orbifold point, and another for a sphere with one puncture and two 3-punctures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complete degeneration picture inside the variety of nilpotent associative algebras of dimension 3 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not equal to 2. Comparing with the discussion in [Ivanova N.M. and Pallikaros C.A., Degenerations of complex associative algebras of dimension three via Lie and Jordan algebras, {\it Advances in Group Theory and Applications}, 18 (2024), 41-79], for some of the arguments in the present article we needed to develop alternative techniques which are now valid over an arbitrary algebraically closed field. There is a dichotomy of cases concerning the results obtained, corresponding to whether the characteristic of the field is 2 or not.</description>

      <title>Dual Quaternion Weighted Directed Graph and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05132v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first study the multi-agent formation control problem in a directed graph. The relative configurations are expressed by unit dual quaternions (UDQs). We call such a weighted directed graph a unit dual quaternion weighted directed graph (UDQWDG). We show that a desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable in a {UDQWDG} if and only if for any cycle in this directed graph, the product of relative configurations of the forward arcs, and inverses of relative configurations of the backward arcs, is equal to $1$. We then show that a desired relative configuration scheme in a {directed connected} graph {is reasonable if and only if} the dual quaternion Laplacian is similar to the unweighted Laplacian of the directed graph. Then for a reasonable desired relative configuration scheme, we build the relationship between the desired formation and the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. A numerical method and a control law {are} presented. We then study dual quaternion weighted directed graphs (DQWDG). Ordinary graphs, gain graphs, signed directed graphs, complex weighted directed graphs and UDQWDGs are special cases of DQWDGs. A general theory of DQWDG is presented.</description>

      <title>The 3-Preprojective Algebras Of Type $\~A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ act on $R = \mathbb{C}[X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}]$ by change of variables. Then, the skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is bimodule $(n+1)$-Calabi-Yau. Under certain circumstances, the algebra admits a locally finite-dimensional grading of Gorenstein parameter $1$, in which case it is the $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra of its $n$-representation infinite degree $0$ piece, as defined by Herschend, Iyama and Oppermann. If the group $G$ is abelian, the $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra is said to be of type $\~A$. For a given group $G$, it is not obvious whether $R \ast G$ admits such a grading making it into an $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra. We study the case when $n=2$ and $G$ is abelian. We give an explicit classification of groups such that $R \ast G$ is $3$-preprojective by constructing such gradings. This is possible as long as $G$ is not a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and not $C_2 \times C_2$. For a fixed $G$, the algebra $R \ast G$ admits different $3$-preprojective gradings, so we associate a type to a grading and classify all types. Then we show that gradings of the same type are related by a certain kind of mutation. This gives a classification of $2$-representation infinite algebras of type $\~A$. The involved quivers are those arising from hexagonal dimer models on the torus, and the gradings we consider correspond to perfect matchings on the dimer, or equivalently to periodic lozenge tilings of the plane. Consequently, we classify these tilings up to flips, which correspond to the mutation we consider.</description>
