      <title>Fuzzy permutation time irreversibility for nonequilibrium analysis of complex system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation time irreversibility is an important method to quantify nonequilibrium characteristics of complex systems; however, ordinal pattern is a coarse-graining alternative of temporal structure and cannot accurately represent detailed structural information. This study aims to propose a fuzzy permutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between vector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude permutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated; then, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and backward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's complexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of information in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy permutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are generated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to verify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with congestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the PhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the system's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of heartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR and fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results in the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory of complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately characterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the nonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for exploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy complexity.</description>

      <title>The Elastic Analysis Facility's (EAF's) Contribution to the Future of Analysis at Multi-Experiment Institutions and Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF) hosted at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is a platform being developed with the goal of providing a fast and efficient facility for physics analysis. As high-energy physics moves towards collecting larger datasets, such as those from the High-Luminosity LHC, the EAF strives to provide a powerful and adaptable framework for future colliders and multi-experiment institutions. Currently, the EAF supports several experiments including CMS, NOvA, and DUNE as well as serving accelerator physicists and beam line operations through integrated software and secure connections to Fermilab's computing resources. In addition, the EAF was designed with a user-friendly interface, intended to be more intuitive for emerging generations of physicists, that is still accessible for established styles of analysis. The EAF can also achieve better analysis efficiency due to the modernization of software and tools that can better utilize Fermilab's computing power. Furthermore, its design incorporates industry standards whenever possible, enhancing its sustainability and making it a possible template for other national or international laboratories and research facilities. Overall, the EAF is a forward-looking solution that will meet the evolving needs of particle physics, ensuring readiness for future colliders and multi-experiment research institutions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging chaos in the training of artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions -- as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --. Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters, and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in the training of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Cascade Mitigation in Power Systems Using Influence Graph Improved by Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite high reliability, modern power systems with growing renewable penetration face an increasing risk of cascading outages. Real-time cascade mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model (MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in mitigating cascade propagation.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Representations of Neutrino Telescope Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by instrumenting a cubic-kilometer volume of naturally occurring transparent medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational autoencoders to efficiently represent neutrino telescope events by learning compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Topological Partitioning of a Large-Scale Real-World Network: Scale-Free Properties and Minimal Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.</description>
