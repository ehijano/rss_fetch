      <description>arXiv:2504.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism that allows thermal relic dark matter to annihilate efficiently in the Galactic Halo and in galaxy clusters, but not in the lower-velocity environments of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We realize this within a complete model in which the dark matter consists of two distinct states separated by a small mass splitting. An indirect detection signal is generated only through the coannihilations of these two states, requiring both to be present. In the halo of the Milky Way, the dark matter particles in the lighter state can be excited into the long-lived heavier state through scattering. Once excited, these heavier particles can coannihilate with those in the lighter state, yielding a gamma-ray signal with little or no suppression. By contrast, the dark matter particles in dwarf galaxies do not possess enough kinetic energy to be excited, thereby suppressing the coannihilation rate and corresponding indirect detection signals from those systems. This framework breaks the predictive relationship that ordinarily exists between these respective gamma-ray signals and complicates our ability to interpret the results of indirect detection searches.</description>

      <title>Search for Axions in Magnetic White Dwarf Polarization at Lick and Keck Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most sensitive search to date for light axion-like particles with masses below a micro-eV, using spectropolarimetric data collected from the Lick and Keck Observatories. The conversion of optical photons emitted from the surface of a magnetic white dwarf (MWD) into axions in the strong magnetic field around the star induces a nearly wavelength-independent linear polarization in the observed starlight. We analyze the Stokes parameters $(U, Q, I)$ measured with the Kast spectrograph at the Lick Observatory toward the MWDs SDSS J033320+000720 and ZTF J190132+145807, and with the LRISp-ADC instrument at the Keck Observatory toward ZTF J190132+145807, SDSS J002129+150223, and SDSS J100356+053825 to search for this effect. The data show no evidence of axion-induced linear polarization, and we set world-leading constraints on the axion-photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-12} \,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at the $95\%$ confidence level for masses $m_a \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Factorization for Collider Dataspace Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A metric on the space of collider physics data enables analysis of its geometrical properties, like dimensionality or curvature, as well as quantifying the density with which a finite, discrete ensemble of data samples the space. We provide the first systematically-improvable precision calculations on this dataspace, presenting predictions resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, using the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) as its metric. This is accomplished by demonstration of factorization of soft and collinear contributions to the metric at leading power and renormalization group evolution of the single-scale functions that are present in the factorization theorem. As applications of this general framework, we calculate the two-point correlator between pairs of jets on the dataspace, and the measure of the non-Gaussian fluctuations in a finite dataset. For the non-Gaussianities, our calculations validate the existence of a universal structure that had been previously observed in simulated data. As byproducts of this analysis, we also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension of the SEMD metric and show that the original Energy Mover's Distance metric is identical to the SEMD through next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tests of quantum contextuality in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality refers to the impossibility of assigning a predefined, intrinsic value to a physical property of a system independently of the context in which the property is measured. It is, perhaps, the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The many states with different spin that particle physics provides are the ideal setting for testing contextuality. We verify that the polarization states of single spin-1 massive particles produced at colliders are contextual. We test $W^{+}$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons in $\chi^0_c$ and $\chi^1_c$ charmonium decays by reinterpreting the data and the analyses of the ATLAS, LHCb, Belle II and BESIII experimental collaborations, respectively. The polarization states of these four particles show contextuality with a significance larger than $5\sigma$. We also discuss the presence of quantum contextuality in spin states of bipartite systems formed by spin-1/2 particles. We test $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ baryons reinterpreting two BESIII data analyses, and pairs of top quarks utilizing a recent analysis of the CMS collaboration. Quantum contextuality is present with a significance exceeding $5\sigma$ also in these cases. In addition, we study the feasibility of testing quantum contextuality by means of $Z$ boson production in association with the Higgs boson, $Z$ and $W$ bosons pairs created in Higgs boson decays and with pairs of $\tau$ leptons. For the latter, we use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the settings of SuperKEKB and of future lepton colliders. Experiments at high energies, though not designed for the purpose, perform surprisingly well in testing for quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Natural complex plane for kaon CKM data: framework, status and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaon physics can be used to independently determine three out of the four parameters of the CKM matrix, without any B physics input. Treating one parameter, $|V_{us}|$, or alternatively Wolfenstein $\lambda$, as well known, we show that the natural plane for the presentation of kaon CKM information is spanned by the combinations $\left(A^2(1-\hat\rho),\, A^2 \hat\eta\right)$. In this way, the use of B physics inputs is avoided, as well as the artificial inflation of errors due to parametric uncertainties, mainly due to $|V_{cb}|$. We show that the current status of kaon CKM constraints, impacted by recent advances in measurement and theory, is characterized by four allowed regions, and find that incoming data will inevitably disfavor a number of them, either confirming the CKM paradigm as dominant, or discovering a departure from the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sensitivity for Di-Higgs Boson Searches Using Anomaly Detection and Supervised Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores different strategies for enhancing sensitivity to new heavy resonances that decay into two or more Higgs bosons. This is achieved using two neural network architectures: an unsupervised autoencoder for anomaly detection and a supervised classifier. The autoencoder is trained on a small fraction of Standard Model (SM) Monte Carlo simulated events to calculate the loss distribution for input events, aiding in determining the extent to which events can be considered anomalous. The supervised classifier uses the same inputs but is trained on events simulated using both beyond Standard Model (BSM) and SM processes. By applying selection cuts to the output scores, we compare the sensitivities of the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Searching for the LFV $\gamma\gamma e\mu$ interaction at $e^- e^+$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of detecting the Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) process $e^- e^+ \to e^- e^+ e\,\mu \quad (e = e^-,\,e^+;\; \mu = \mu^-,\,\mu^+)$ at the forthcoming $e^-e^+$ colliders Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). Our predictions are based on an effective operator framework that induces the LFV interaction $\gamma\gamma e\mu$. According to three benchmark points that are consistent with theoretical and current experimental constraints, we find that all of them are experimentally feasible, predicting $\textit{signal significances}$ $\mathcal{S} \geq 5\sigma$ at both colliders for relatively low integrated luminosities and center-of-mass energies between $500-1000$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Holographic phase transitions via thermally-assisted tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

The slow matter thus formed is shown to follow laws of Special Relativity mediated by velocity w rather than c, and to possess dynamical properties recalling some characteristics of Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Toponium: Implementation of a toponium model in FeynRules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toponium -- a bound state of the top-antitop pair ($t\bar{t}$) -- emerges as the smallest and simplest hadronic system in QCD, with an ultrashort lifetime ($\tau_t \sim 2.5\times 10^{-25}$~s) and a femtometer-scale Bohr radius ($r_{\text{Bohr}} \sim 7\times 10^{-18}$~m). We present a computational framework extending the Standard Model (SM) with two S-wave toponium states: a spin-singlet $\eta_t$ ($J^{PC}=0^{-+}$) and a spin-triplet $J_t$ ($J^{PC}=1^{--}$). Using nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) and a Coulomb potential, we derived couplings to SM particles (gluons, electroweak bosons, Higgs boson, and fermion pairs) and implemented the Lagrangian in FeynRules, generating FeynArts, MadGraph, and WHIZARD models for collider simulations. Key results include dominant decay channels ($\eta_t \to gg/ZH$, $J_t \to W^+W^-/b\bar{b}$) and leading order (LO) cross sections for $pp \to \eta_t(nS) \to {\rm non-}t\bar{t}$ ({66 fb} at 13 TeV). The model avoids double-counting artifacts by excluding direct $t\bar{t}$ couplings, thereby ensuring consistency with perturbative QCD. This work establishes a complete pipeline for precision toponium studies, bridging NRQCD, collider phenomenology, and tests of SM validity at future lepton colliders (e.g., CEPC, FCC-ee, muon colliders) and the LHC. This provides the first publicly available UFO model for toponium, enabling direct integration with MadGraph and WHIZARD for simulations.</description>

      <title>$D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular states: Probing their electromagnetic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>First insight into transverse-momentum-dependent fragmentation physics at photon-photon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future planned lepton colliders, both in the circular and linear configurations, can effectively work as virtual and quasi-real photon-photon colliders and are expected to stimulate an intense physics program in the next few years. In this paper, we suggest to consider photon-photon scattering as a useful source of information on transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (TMD FFs), complementing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes, which provide most of the present phenomenological information on TMD FFs. As a first illustrative example, we study two-hadron azimuthal asymmetries around the jet thrust-axis in the process $\ell^+\ell^-\to\gamma^* \gamma\to q\bar q\to h_1 h_2 + X$, in which in a circular lepton collider one tagged, deeply-virtual photon scatters off an untagged quasi-real photon, both originating from the initial lepton beams, producing inclusively an almost back-to-back light-hadron pair with large transverse momentum, in the $\gamma^*\gamma$ center of mass frame. Similar processes, in a more complicated environment due to the presence of initial hadronic states, can also be studied in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC and the planned future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Notes on optimizing a multi-sensor gradient axion-like particle dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for the dark matter. We discuss the scaling of the sensitivity of a galactic ALP dark matter search with the number of sensors, especially in the ultra-light mass regime, where the measurement time is shorter than the coherence time of the ALP field. We compare multiple schemes for daily modulated ALP gradient signals, and show that increasing the number of sensors from 1 to 2 improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2-3. For more than two sensors, the SNR increases as the square root of the number of sensors. Then, we show that splitting the data into subsets and then averaging its Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) is equivalent to the DFT of the whole dataset in terms of SNR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse HERA data on leading neutron production in one-pion exchange approximation. The dipole-pion cross section as function of transverse separation $\bf r$ at small Bjorken variable $\beta$ is parameterized within the bSat model.
  The evolution of the dipole-pion cross section is performed applying the Laplace transformation technique. We demonstrate that geometric scaling
  for the dipole-pion cross section hold approximately within a wide kinematic region of $rQ_s$. The geometrical scaling is improved applying the evolution method. That is compared with the constituent quark picture and the color dipole BFKL expansion. The cross section saturates at large dipole sizes.</description>

      <title>Exact-WKB Analysis of Two-level Floquet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of the exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to two-level Floquet systems and establish a systematic procedure to calculate the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. We show that, in the exact-WKB analysis, the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of cycle integrals (Voros symbol), which characterize monodromy matrices for Schr\"odinger-type differential equations governing two-level Floquet systems. We analytically evaluate the cycle integrals using the low-frequency expansion and derive both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. To verify the accuracy of our results, we compare them with numerical calculations and analyze resonant oscillations, which reveal non-perturbative features that cannot be captured by the perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers can exist and observe an accelerating universe, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because extremely light axions would require the bare cosmological constant to be unnaturally close to zero to achieve accelerated expansion. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. This outcome is intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offers a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism, based on spinor-helicity techniques, to generalize the formulation of partial wave unitarity bounds. We discuss unitarity bounds for $N \to M$ (with $N,M \geq 2$) scattering processes -- relevant for high-energy future colliders -- and spin-2 or higher-spin theories -- relevant for effective field theories of gravity -- that are not approachable by standard methods. Moreover, we emphasize the power and complementarity of positivity and partial wave unitarity bounds to constrain the parameter space of effective field theories.</description>

      <title>A two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majorana fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have a new Higgs boson in the model and in the case of the decoupling limit, the fermion dark matter production is only determined by $S$ and the new Higgs boson. The mass hierarchy of these new particles can make a difference in the reaction rate of dark matter annihilation processes, contributing to different viable parameter spaces for different mass orderings. We randomly scanned the parameter space with six various cases under relic density constraint and found that when $\chi$ is the lightest among the dark sector, $\chi$ production is generated via the so-called forbidden channels. Moreover, we consider the combined limits arising from Higgs invisible decay, dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints. Within the chosen parameter space, direct detection results put the most stringent constraint, and we have a more flexible value for the scalar dark matter mass when the mass of $\chi$ is not smaller than the new Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Inverse Seesaw Using $S_3$ Modular Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing neutrino masses using the inverse seesaw mechanism with discrete flavor symmetry imposed through modular forms provides a testable framework at TeV scales with fewer parameters. However, $S_3$, the smallest modular group, remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we construct the minimal supersymmetric inverse seesaw model based on the modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry. In our model, the light neutrino mass matrix depends on 6 real parameters: the complex modulus, an overall scale for light neutrino mass, a real ratio and a complex ratio of Yukawa coupling. Thanks to its minimality, our model offers various definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino masses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses ($\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta decay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for $\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next generation experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor violating decays $\ell\to\ell'\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Lee Yang edge singularities of QCD in association with Roberge-Weiss phase transition and chiral phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions in the complex chemical potential plane in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, in the presence of a constant gluonic background field that represents confining dynamics. We solve the quark gap equation and the background field equation self consistently, which allows us to directly explore the confinement phase transition and furthermore, evaluate the impact of the back-coupling of confinement on chiral symmetry breaking. Moreover, within such a coupled framework towards the complex chemical potential region, we demonstrate the emergence of Roberge-Weiss (RW) symmetry and investigate the trajectory of Lee-Yang edge singularities (LYES). Our analysis reveals that the LYES scaling behavior is similar to our previous findings without the background field condensate. However, a significant difference from our earlier work is that the trajectory of LYES terminates when the imaginary part of the singularity becomes $1/3 \, \pi T$. We elaborate that this cut-off behavior is caused by the RW symmetry that is symmetric to the imaginary chemical potential $\mu_i=1/3 \, \pi T$.</description>

      <title>Weizs\"acker-Williams Gluon Helicity Distribution and Inclusive Dijet Production in Longitudinally Polarized Electron-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the back-to-back (correlation) limit of inclusive quark-antiquark dijet production in unpolarized high energy electron-proton collisions can probe the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams (WW) gluon transverse momentum-dependent distribution (TMD) at small $x$ \cite{Dominguez:2010xd, Dominguez:2011wm}. In this paper, we consider a helicity-dependent version of the same process: we study the double-spin asymmetry for inclusive quark-antiquark dijet production in longitudinally polarized electron-proton scattering at high energies. We show that in the back-to-back limit this process probes the WW gluon helicity TMD. Furthermore, we derive the small-$x$ evolution equation for the operator related to the WW gluon helicity distribution. We find that in the double-logarithmic approximation and in the large-$N_c$ limit, the small-$x$ asymptotics of the WW gluon helicity distribution is governed by exactly the same evolution equation as that for the dipole gluon helicity distribution. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for inclusive dijet production in the longitudinally polarized electron-proton collisions can thus test the small-$x$ helicity evolution equations and facilitate constraining the initial conditions for phenomenology based on these equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the prompt-delayed signals induced by knockout neutrons from the quasi-elastic scattering in neutrino experiments provides a new avenue for detecting light dark matter. As an illustration, we consider the detection of atmospheric dark matter in the liquid scintillator detectors. The results show that the constraint on the DM-nucleon interaction from KamLAND is approximately one order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained from the elastic nuclear recoil signals in dark matter direct detection experiments. Furthermore, a larger volume neutrino experiment, such as JUNO, is expected to significantly enhance the light dark matter detection sensitivity through the quasi-elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Feynman integrals for leading colour $t\bar{t}W$ production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute a complete set of the two-loop Feynman integrals that are required for the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to on-shell top-pair production in association with a $W$ boson at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation. These Feynman integrals also contribute to Higgs or $Z$-boson production in association with a top pair. We employ the method of differential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to handle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. The presence of the top quark in the virtual propagators, in addition to the mass of the external $W$ boson, gives rise to nested square roots and three elliptic curves. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear, and are $\epsilon$-factorised otherwise. We express the DEs in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms, separating the logarithmic ones. We solve the DEs numerically in the physical kinematic region, with the method of generalised power series expansions.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-Violating Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings at Electron-Positron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the forms of CP-violating (CPV) neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) that can be realized via dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We present a new formulation of the CPV nTGC form factors that is compatible with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry, and show how these CPV form factors can be matched consistently with the corresponding dimension-8 CPV nTGC operators in the broken phase. We then study probes of the CPV nTGCs at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = (0.25, 0.5,1, 3, 5)$TeV respectively, demonstrating that the $e^{\mp}$ beam polarizations can help to improve the sensitivities of probes of the nTGCs. We estimate that the sensitivities for probing the new physics scales of the nTGCs can range from ${O}(\rm{TeV})$ at a 250GeV $e^+e^-$ collider to ${O}(10\rm{TeV})$ at a 5TeV $e^+e^-$ collider, and that the sensitivities to form factors range from ${O}(10^{-4})$ to ${O}(10^{-8})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate comparisons between theoretical models and experimental data are critical for scientific progress. However, inferred model parameters can vary significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we explicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model the domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about where a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements observed as additional experimental observables are integrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a generative machine learning-based approach for estimating multi-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) in a target sample using a statistically independent but related control sample - a common challenge in particle physics data analysis. The generative model must accurately reproduce individual observable distributions while preserving the correlations between them, based on the input multidimensional distribution from the control sample. Here we present a conditional normalizing flow model (CNF) based on a chain of bijectors which learns to transform unpaired simulation events to data events. We assess the performance of the CNF model in the context of LHC Higgs to diphoton analysis, where we use the CNF model to convert a Monte Carlo diphoton sample to one that models data. We show that the CNF model can accurately model complex data distributions and correlations. We also leverage the recently popularized Modified Differential Multiplier Method (MDMM) to improve the convergence of our model and assign physical meaning to usually arbitrary loss-function parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the soft theorems for scattering amplitudes of scalar effective field theories to one-loop order. Our analysis requires carefully accounting for the fact that the soft limit is not guaranteed to commute with evaluating IR-divergent loop integrals; new results for the soft limit of general scalar one-loop integrals are presented. The geometric soft theorem remains unmodified for any derivatively-coupled scalar effective field theory, and we conjecture that this statement holds to all orders. In contrast, the soft theorem receives nontrivial corrections in the presence of potential interactions, analogous to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. We derive the universal leading-order correction to the scalar soft theorem arising from potential interactions at one loop. Explicit examples are provided that illustrate the general results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the Standard Model. Although there exist constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments, the dynamical evolution of astrophysical objects could provide a promising probe for these interactions. Obtaining astrophysical predictions is challenging and limited by our ability to simulate scatterings between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We develop a novel scheme that allows simulating these interacting dark matter (IDM) models and accurately accounts for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we use an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction itself is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and letting it interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter. After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrate that we can reproduce their analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges as well as describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing overdensity. Overall, it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations, commonly used in astrophysics. In consequence, our scheme allows for making novel predictions and obtaining new constraints of DM-baryon scattering.</description>

      <title>Taming systematics in distance and inclination measurements with gravitational waves: role of the detector network and higher-order modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of compact binaries have the potential to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance and inclination. However, these parameters are strongly correlated when performing parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW astronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian inference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned second-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer Einstein Telescope~(ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor, detector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this degeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in particular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as long as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <title>In situ axion generation and detection in laser-driven wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-plasma wakefield based schemes for in situ axion generation and detection through the Primakoff process.
  Strong electromagnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^{9}\,$V/cm) in the wakefield enhance axion production rates by orders of magnitude compared to conventional light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments. By replacing the axion generation stage with laser-wakefield interaction, one can achieve the axion-photon coupling constraints to the level of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-12}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.
  Besides, the generated axions can convert back into photons in the background field, leading to axion-regenerated electromagnetic fields (AREM) with unique polarization, frequency, and transverse distribution properties.
  This allows for effective filtering of the AREM from the background field, enhancing signal-to-noise ratios.
  This approach establishes plasma wakefields as a promising platform for laboratory axion searches.</description>

      <title>Testing the Star-disk Collision Model for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the star-disk collision model by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_*$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_*$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_*$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Palatini Linear Attractors Are Back in ACTion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.9743$, in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear inflation. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.0667$ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work, we investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We consider two classes of models based on simple monomial potentials: (i) models with a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity, and (ii) models including an $\alpha R^2$ term. In the first case, we find that a quadratic potential with a linear non-minimal coupling leads to the linear inflation attractor, with $r$ suppressed as $\xi$ increases. In the second case, we show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent with observations for sufficiently large $\alpha$. Our results demonstrate that simple monomial models can remain compatible with current observational constraints when embedded in the Palatini framework.</description>

      <title>Combination and interpretation of differential Higgs boson production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of Higgs boson differential production cross sections are a key tool to probe the properties of the Higgs boson and test the standard model. New physics can affect both Higgs boson production and decay, leading to deviations from the distributions that are expected in the standard model. In this paper, combined measurements of differential spectra in a fiducial region matching the experimental selections are performed, based on analyses of four Higgs boson decay channels ($\gamma\gamma$, ZZ$^{(*)}$, WW$^{(*)}$, and $\tau\tau$) using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The differential measurements are extrapolated to the full phase space and combined to provide the differential spectra. A measurement of the total Higgs boson production cross section is also performed using the $\gamma\gamma$ and ZZ decay channels, with a result of 53.4$^{+2.9}_{-2.9}$ (stat)$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ (syst) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction of 55.6 $\pm$ 2.5 pb. The fiducial measurements are used to compute limits on Higgs boson couplings using the $\kappa$-framework and the SM effective field theory.</description>

Abstract: Fermionic dark matter absorption on nuclear targets via neutral current interactions is explored using a non-relativistic effective field theory framework. An analysis of data from the PICO-60 C$_{3}$F$_{8}$ bubble chamber sets leading constraints on spin-independent absorption for dark matter masses below 23 MeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and establishes the first limits on spin-dependent absorptive interactions. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of bubble chambers to low-mass dark matter and underscore the importance of absorption searches in expanding the parameter space of direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave anisotropies from axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important prediction of inflation is the production of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background. Observing this background is challenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of an astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One possible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies. In this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational wave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation, where the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields. In this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification of vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the inverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of gravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the contribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes sourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former, previously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the sourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at interferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This result shows that axion inflation can generate large anisotropies with the potential to be observed by gravitational wave detectors within a reasonable time frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models with singlet extensions can accommodate single- or multi-step first-order phase transitions (FOPT) along the various constituent field directions. Such a framework can also produce Gravitational Waves, detectable at the upcoming space-based interferometers, e.g., U-DECIGO. We explore the dynamics of electroweak phase transition and the production of Gravitational Waves in an extended set-up of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with a Standard Model singlet right-handed neutrino superfield. We examine the role of the new parameters compared to NMSSM on the phase transition dynamics and observe that the occurrence of a FOPT, an essential requirement for Electroweak Baryogenesis, typically favours a right-handed sneutrino state below 125 GeV. Our investigation shows how the analysis can offer complementary probes for physics beyond the Standard Model besides the collider searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>The Amaterasu particle: constraining the superheavy dark matter origin of UHECRs</title>

Abstract: Amaterasu, the second most energetic ($244$ EeV) cosmic ray particle has been recently detected by the Telescope Array (TA) surface detector. The origin of the TA Amaterasu event is puzzling, as its arrival direction points back to a void in the local Universe, lacking conventional astrophysical ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic ray sources. Hence, we explore the possibility if this TA Amaterasu event could have originated from the decay of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) in the Milky Way. Such an origin also opens up multi-messenger detection channels in both UHE gamma-rays and UHE neutrinos. In this present work, using the TA Amaterasu event and the multi-messenger limits/sensitivities from various UHE telescopes, we place stringent constraints on the lifetime and mass of the SHDM. We find that the non-detection of the corresponding gamma-rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the TA is in severe tension with the SHDM parameter space required to explain the TA Amaterasu event. Additionally, we extend the multi-messenger analysis to the future UHE gamma-ray and UHE neutrino telescopes such as PAO upgrade, GRAND 200k and IceCube-Gen2. We find that the bounds from the future neutrino telescopes will be able to compete with the present UHECR bounds. However, compared to the existing UHE gamma-ray bounds, the future PAO upgrade and the GRAND 200k gamma-ray detectors will improve the bounds on SHDM lifetime by at least one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that, in general, the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory Of Dark Matter-Electron Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic excitations in atomic, molecular, and crystal targets are at the forefront of the ongoing search for light, sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In many light DM-electron interactions the energy and momentum deposited is much smaller than the electron mass, motivating a non-relativistic (NR) description of the electron. Thus, for any target, light DM-electron phenomenology relies on understanding the interactions between the DM and electron in the NR limit. In this work we derive the NR effective field theory (EFT) of general DM-electron interactions from a top-down perspective, starting from general high-energy DM-electron interaction Lagrangians. This provides an explicit connection between high-energy theories and their low-energy phenomenology in electron excitation based experiments. Furthermore, we derive Feynman rules for the DM-electron NR EFT, allowing observables to be computed diagrammatically, which can systematically explain the presence of in-medium screening effects in general DM models. We use these Feynman rules to compute absorption, scattering, and dark Thomson scattering rates for a wide variety of high-energy DM models.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological observations strongly suggest the existence of Dark Matter\,(DM). Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider\,(LHC) have the potential to probe the particle nature of the DM. In the present work, we investigate the potential of the mono-Higgs plus Missing Transverse Energy signature at the LHC to search for a relatively light fermionic dark matter candidate using the framework of Effective Field Theory. In our study, the DM interacts with the Standard Model\,(SM) via dimension-6 and dimension-7 effective operators involving the Higgs and the gauge bosons. Although, our analysis is independent of any Ultra Violet complete dynamics of DM, such interactions can be realized in an extension of the SM where the gauge group is extended minimally by adding an extra $U(1)$. Both cut-based and Boosted Decision Tree\,(BDT) discriminators are used to estimate and optimize the signal sensitivity over the SM backgrounds, assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~fb^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV at the High Luminosity phase of the LHC\,(HL-LHC). It can be seen that in the best scenario, atleast $4\sigma$ significance can be achieved for relic masses upto 200 GeV, showcasing the prospects of this search at the HL-LHC. This study provides a foundation for future explorations in this direction.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demand the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

      <title>Directional Direct Detection of MeV Scale Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario via Dark Photon Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores a two-component dark matter model in which one component, heavier dark matter, annihilates into a lighter dark matter. The lighter dark matter is expected to generate detectable signals in detectors due to its enhanced momentum, enabling direct detection even for MeV-scale dark matter. We investigate the effectiveness of directional direct detections, especially the nuclear emulsion detector NEWSdm, in verifying these boosted dark matter particles through nuclear recoil. In particular, we focus on light nuclei, such as protons and carbon, as suitable targets for this detection method due to their high sensitivity to MeV-scale dark matter. By modeling the interactions mediated by a dark photon in a hidden U(1)$_D$ gauge symmetry framework, we calculate the expected dark matter flux and scattering rates for various detector configurations. Our results show that nuclear emulsions have the potential to yield distinct, direction-sensitive dark matter signals from the Galactic center, providing a new way to probe low-mass dark matter parameter spaces that evade conventional detection methods.</description>

      <title>Cooling the Shock: New Supernova Constraints on Dark Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the accretion phase of a core-collapse supernova (SN), dark-photon (DP) cooling can be largest in the gain layer below the stalled shock wave. In this way, it could counter-act the usual shock rejuvenation by neutrino energy deposition and thus prevent the explosion. This peculiar energy-loss profile derives from the resonant nature of DP production. The largest cooling and thus strongest constraints obtain for DP masses of 0.1-0.4 MeV, a range corresponding to the photon plasma mass in the gain region. Electron-capture SNe, once observationally unambiguously identified, could provide strong bounds even down to nearly 0.01 MeV. For a coupling strength so small that neutrino-driven explosions are expected to survive, the DP cooling of the core is too small to modify the neutrino signal, i.e., our new argument supersedes the traditional SN1987A cooling bound.</description>

      <title>Neutrino properties from muonium-antimuonium mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of neutrino mass -- whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles -- remains one of the central open questions in particle physics. While observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would confirm the Majorana case, the absence of a signal offers no definitive insight. In light of this, we investigate muonium-antimuonium mixing -- proposed for further study at the MACE experiment -- as an alternative probe of neutrino properties. We compute the mixing amplitude in the Standard Model minimally extended to include massive Dirac or Majorana neutrinos, and correct previous calculations by properly treating the relevant infrared scales. As the GIM mechanism strongly suppresses the Dirac contribution, we explore whether relaxing unitarity of the PMNS matrix can enhance the mixing without obscuring neutrino properties. Surprisingly, the answer to this question is negative. We also examine the pseudo-Dirac case -- predominantly Dirac neutrinos with small Majorana masses -- and find that this scenario can significantly enhance the mixing compared to the pure Dirac case, especially for normal mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Axionless Solution to the Strong CP Problem -- two-zeros textures of the quark and lepton mass matrices and neutrino CP violation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD. This solution requires the vanishing ${\rm arg}\,[{\rm det}\, M_d\, {\rm det} M_u]$, where the $M_d$ and $M_u$ are the mass matrices for the down- and up-type quarks. It happens if we have several zeros in the quark mass matrices. We proceed a systematic construction, in this paper, of two zeros textures for the down-type quark mass matrix while the mass matrix for the up-type quarks is always diagonal. We find only three types of the mass matrices can explain the observed CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and the charged leptons and the small enough vacuum angle $\theta &lt; 10^{-10}$. We extend the mass construction to the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP violating parameter $\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter $m_{\beta\beta}$. It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchies in the neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where we introduce only two right-handed neutrinos $N$s. Furthermore, we have a strict prediction on the $\delta_{CP} \simeq 200^\circ$ or $250^\circ$ in the NH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of $\eta_{1}(1855)$ and it's partner in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discoveries of \(X(3872)\) (\(c\bar{q}\)-\(q\bar{c}\)) and \(T_{cc}\) (\(c\bar{q}\)-\(c\bar{q}\)), we systematically study two four-quark systems: the \(K K_1\) (\(q\bar{s}\)-\(q\bar{s}\)) system and the \(K \bar{K}_1\) (\(q\bar{s}\)-\(s\bar{q}\)) system, which is a candidate for the recently observed \(\eta_1(1855)\). Within the framework of an accurate few-body calculation method (GEM), we employ the chiral quark model to simultaneously consider the molecular and diquark structures of these two multiquark systems and include their channel coupling effects. Our results show that the \(K \bar{K}_1\) system remains a scattering state. On the other hand, due to the presence of a good-diquark structure in the \(K K_1\) system, we obtain a bound state in the coupled-channel calculation. The primary contribution to the binding energy comes from the exchange of \(\pi\)-meson and \(\sigma\)-meson. The inter-quark distance indicates that it is a compact four-quark structure.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Features of Parton Energy Loss in Heavy-ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Fields on Urca Rates in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isospin-equilibrating weak processes, called ``Urca" processes, are of fundamental importance in astrophysical environments like (proto-)neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and supernovae. In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in the flavor equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized version of the Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The model is inspired from Graphene, which shows a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the mean field approximation have been studied before. Here, we go beyond the mean field level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations formulated in phase shift solutions, which we explore numerically, for the first time including their momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure, and phase shifts. The inclusion of momentum dependence in the phase shift shows a significant difference from the Lorentz-boosted version of the phase shift previously used in the literature. We find resurrection of the pseudoscalar bound states at large momentum above Mott temperature and show that the presence of Landau modes significantly contributes to the fluctuation pressure.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and with the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>Analytic bootstrap bounds on masses and spins in gravitational and non-gravitational scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic constraints on the weakly-coupled spectrum of theories with a massless scalar under the standard assumptions of the S-matrix bootstrap program. These bootstrap bounds apply to any theory (with or without gravity) with fully crossing symmetric (i.e. $stu$-symmetric) four-point amplitudes and generalize results for color- or flavor-ordered (i.e. $su$-symmetric) planar amplitudes recently proved by one of the authors. We assume that the theory is weakly-coupled below some cut-off, that the four-point massless scalar amplitude is polynomially-bounded in the Regge limit, and that this amplitude exchanges states with a discrete set of masses and a finite set of spins at each mass level. The spins and masses must then satisfy ``Sequential Spin Constraints" (SSC) and ``Sequential Mass Constraints" (SMC). The SSC requires the lightest spin-$j$ state to be lighter than the lightest spin-$(j+1)$ state (in the $su$-symmetric case) or the lightest spin-$(j+2)$ state (in the $stu$-symmetric case). The SMC requires the mass of the lightest spin-$j$ state to be smaller than some non-linear function of the masses of lower-spin states. Our results also apply to super-gluon and super-graviton amplitudes stripped of their polarization dependence. In particular, the open and closed superstring spectra saturate the SSC with maximum spins ${J_{n,\text{open}} = n+1}$ and ${J_{n,\text{closed}} = 2n+2}$, respectively, at the $n^\text{th}$ mass level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a baryon in a top-down holographic QCD. In holographic QCD, the baryons are represented as solitons in a 5-dimensional gauge theory. We obtain the soliton solution by solving the equations of motion numerically. Using this result, the energy-momentum tensor and related quantities such as the mass, mean square radii, and the D-term (druck term) are computed. The evaluated D-term is about -2.05, whose absolute value is significantly larger than that in the previous work arXiv:2206.06578.</description>
