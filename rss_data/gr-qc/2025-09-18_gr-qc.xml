      <title>Regular black holes with gravitational self-energy as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate the effect of non-local gravitational self-energy to obtain a neutral, non-singular spacetime geometry. This is achieved by using a non-local gravitational theory inspired by T-duality, where particle mass is not point-like but smeared over a region. This non-local gravitational self-interaction is derived from the Newtonian gravitational potential and energy density, allowing us to define a coordinate-independent quantity. Thus, we incorporate the non-local gravitational field into the spacetime metric. We demonstrate that the total ADM mass is modified by a finite, regularized gravitational mass term, leading to a regular solution of the Ayon-Beato-Garcia type metric but without electric charge. We show the existence of extremal configurations known as \emph{particle-black hole} objects of order of the Planck mass, which are thermodynamically stable, have a vanishing Hawking temperature and could be a viable dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>THE KERR-SEN Solution Satisfying SO(2) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of KERR-SEN solutions that respect SO(2) symmetry, constructed systematically using the Laurent series expansion method. This approach is based on stationary, axisymmetric Euclidean solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations and incorporates advanced techniques for generating stationary gravitational fields, including the variation-of-constants method and nonlinear superposition. Through this unified framework, we obtain fresh insights into axially symmetric gravitational systems, extend the traditional hierarchy of Kerr-NUT solutions, and bring together several foundational analytic methods under a common structure.
  The paper offers explicit derivations, supported by numerical simulations, and provides a detailed discussion of the physical consequences, particularly focusing on the roles of dilaton and axion fields. The extended version also includes a comprehensive historical overview of axisymmetric exact solutions, a thorough explanation of the Laurent series formalism in gravitational theory, and an in-depth analysis of the theoretical and astrophysical significance of KERR-SEN metrics in current research.</description>

      <title>Loop-corrected scalar potentials and late-time acceleration in f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an analytic f(R) gravity model that unifies early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration within a single covariant framework. At high curvature, the model reproduces a Starobinsky-like inflationary plateau, while at low curvature it asymptotes to a stable dark energy-dominated phase. In the scalar-tensor representation, this construction yields a hilltop-type potential in the Jordan frame, which maps to an exponential potential in the Einstein frame. To account for radiative effects, we introduce a logarithmic correction to the Einstein-frame potential inspired by one-loop effective field theory, producing a late-time flattening without requiring fine-tuning. The resulting scalaron dynamics reduce the effective mass to O(H_0), inducing a thawing regime that deviates from a cosmological constant at the sub-percent levels. A joint background likelihood analysis using Pantheon+SH0ES and BAO+CC datasets (within the CPL parametrization) yields H_0 = 73.4+-0.6 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m = 0.253+-0.007, consistent with local expansion rate measurements. The best-fit scalar field parameters are phi_0 \approx 0.027\,M_Pl and lambda \approx 0.010\,M_Pl, corresponding to a present-day dark energy equation of state w_0 \approx -0.985. While compatible with LambdaCDM within current observational bounds, the model satisfies GR recovery at low curvature and exhibits attractor-like behavior, thereby minimizing sensitivity to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Matter Lagrangian in f(Q,T) Gravity: The Accelerating Cosmological Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the logarithmic form of $f(Q,T)$ gravity with two different choices of matter Lagrangian such as: $\mathcal{L}_m = p$ and $\mathcal{L}_m = -\rho$. The parameters of the model has been constrained using Cosmic Chronometers (CC) in combination with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia supernova datasets. We have observed that the deceleration parameter shows a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase and the effective equation of state parameter ($\omega$) approaches to $-1$ at late times. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a decreasing profile, confirming quintessence-like behavior, and the statefinder analysis demonstrates trajectories that remain near the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point but deviate into the quintessence region. The evolution of the density parameters satisfies the flatness condition, and the predicted age of the Universe lies within $t_0 \sim 13.7-14.3$ Gyr, consistent with CMB and stellar estimates. The findings indicate that the logarithmic model successfully reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion for both the choices of the matter Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the comformal variables.</description>

      <title>From de Sitter to Anti-de Sitter singularity regularization: theory and phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations of vacuum polarization in extremely compact stars suggest that, in such regimes, the effective matter content of spacetime may acquire a vacuum-energy equation of state with negative energy density, mimicking a negative cosmological constant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a general algorithm to modify well-known spherically symmetric regular black hole metrics by replacing their usual de Sitter cores (dSC) with Anti-de Sitter cores (AdSC). Like their dSC counterparts, these AdSC solutions may exhibit two, one, or no horizons depending on the value of a regularization parameter l. We present explicit examples of AdSC-Bardeen and AdSC-Dymnikova metrics, analyze their main properties, and investigate some of their phenomenological signatures using test fields. In particular, we compare their fundamental quasinormal modes and echo signals with those of the dSC cases, highlighting potential avenues for distinguishing them observationally.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resolution of Mass Inflation in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Interiors via Wheeler-DeWitt Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational resolution to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of the spin-2 black hole superradiant instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive spin-2 fields, which arise in proposed extensions of the standard model of particle physics and general relativity, give rise to a superradiant instability around spinning black holes. We study the nonlinear evolution of this instability in quadratic gravity, where quadratic curvature terms are added to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find that as the massive spin-2 field grows, the black hole's spin increases, accelerating the growth rate, and eventually leading to a superextremal horizon. This sharply contrasts with the spin-down and eventual saturation that occurs due to the backreaction of the superradiant instability of a minimally coupled massive spin-0 or spin-1 field.</description>

      <title>GWKokab: An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Wormholes: Myth or Reality? Prospects for Future Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traversable wormholes (TWHs) remain one of the most intriguing predictions of General Relativity (GR), offering passage through space-time. However, their existence requires the violation of the null energy condition, making their detection a bit challenging. The essay aims at showing the new avenues probing the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes and grey body factors, the two fundamental aspects in wave dynamics. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the grey body factors in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers has been investigated. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravity wave observations. Advances in high-precision interferometry and multi-messenger astronomy may soon offer crucial insights into the existence of these exotic structures.

      <title>Simulation-based Inference of Massive Black Hole Binaries using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-based approach for parameter estimation of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs), leveraging normalizing flows to approximate the likelihood function. By training these flows on simulated data, we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios, including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data gaps.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Cosmological Perturbations in Bumblebee Model: Parameter Constraints and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the parameter space of Bumblebee model within a cosmological background and investigate the properties of gravitational waves under the constrained parameter set. Specifically, we derive the conditions for the absence of ghost, Laplacian, and Tachyon instabilities for perturbations in a cosmological background. By incorporating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the observational constraints on tensor gravitational waves, we derive bounds on the parameter space of Bumblebee model. We then examine the polarization modes, propagation speeds, and amplitude relations of gravitational waves within this constrained framework. Our results indicate that the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$ must be non-positive, and the lower bound on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\xi b^2$ is constrained to be on the order of $10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves in Bumblebee model are found to propagate in two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one mixed scalar mode. Notably, the tensor gravitational waves travel at subluminal speeds, whereas the vector and scalar gravitational waves propagate at superluminal speeds. These results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific observational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector with future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Hybrid waveforms for precessing quasi-circular binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for long and accurate gravitational waveforms is increasing as we prepare for the next generation of detectors and seek to improve current waveform models. However, numerical relativity waveforms, while highly accurate, are often too short for these applications due to their high computational cost. Hybrid waveforms, which stitch together gravitational wave signals from different modeling approaches, provide a way to generate complete inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. While hybridization is well-established for aligned-spin systems, precession introduces additional complexities due to gauge ambiguities, frame dependence, or spin dynamics. Here we study the challenges associated with alignment of precessing waveforms and present a systematic approach for constructing hybrid waveforms of precessing quasi-circular systems. Our approach relies on minimal assumptions about the merger waveforms and employs the quadrupole-aligned frame to mitigate mode-mixing. Our method is designed to be robust and broadly applicable, imposing minimal constraints on the input waveforms. This framework expands the applicability of hybridization techniques, facilitating flexible hybrid construction for parameter estimation, model calibration, and gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Local existence theory for a class of CMC gauges for the Einstein-non-linear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to develop a local existence theory for a class of CMC gauges for the Einstein-non-linear scalar field equations. We do so in the context of closed and parallelisable initial manifolds. The assumption that the initial manifold is parallelisable is not a topological restriction in the case of closed oriented 3-manifolds, but it is a restriction in higher dimensions. The results include local existence, uniqueness, a continuation criterion and Cauchy stability. Previous results concerning related gauges have been restricted to the case of n-torus spatial topology. Moreover, they have not covered the Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. The main motivation for developing this theory is that it forms the basis for a family of past global non-linear stability results we derive in a separate article.</description>

Abstract: We study exact cosmological solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity formulated beyond the coincident gauge, focusing on the non-coincident connection branch $\Gamma_B$. Using a minisuperspace approach, the field equations are recast into an equivalent scalar-tensor form, enabling analytic reconstruction of cosmological models. We obtain exact solutions of particular interest, including de Sitter, scaling, $\Lambda$CDM, Chaplygin gas, generalized Chaplygin gas, and CPL parameterizations. The corresponding scalar potentials and $f(Q)$ functions are derived in closed or parametric form. Our analysis shows that non-coincident $f(Q)$ gravity admits a richer solution space than the coincident case and can describe both early-time inflationary dynamics and late-time acceleration within a unified framework. These results open new directions for testing $f(Q)$ cosmology against observations and exploring its role as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>An effective density matrix for vacua in asymptotically flat gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the density matrix associated to the vacuum state of a large spherically symmetric causal diamond of area $A$ in four-dimensional asymptotically flat gravity. We achieve this using the soft effective action, which characterizes the low-energy gravitational degrees of freedom that arise in the long-distance limit of the Einstein-Hilbert action and consists of both the soft graviton mode and the Goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous breaking of supertranslation symmetry. Integrating out the soft graviton mode, we obtain an effective action for purely the Goldstone mode, from which we extract the density matrix and therefore the modular Hamiltonian $K_{s}$ associated to the vacuum state. We explicitly compute the mean and variance of $K_{s}$, finding $\langle \Delta K_{s}^{2} \rangle = A/\epsilon_{\text{UV}}^{2}$, with $\epsilon_{\text{UV}}$ being a length-scale UV cutoff on the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Decoding the string in terms of holographic quantum maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators and preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional understandings of quantum theory hold that measurements change the state of an observed system following the L\"{u}ders update rule. Textbooks describe the application of this idea to non-relativistic systems, but extensions to relativistic and gravitating systems encounter subtleties. One consistent approach is via detector-based measurements. We study the effects of such measurements in a CFT with a holographic dual. We work out the boundary space-time regions associated to a L\"{u}ders update and how the outcome extends to modifications of the bulk gravity state. We explore information-theoretic consequences of this picture, and relate the information extracted by a measurement to updates of the semiclassical parameters of the bulk state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Split Conjecture and an Observational Test for Cosmological Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit string theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and argue that their enabling structures do not persist in realistic cosmologies. We formalize this as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in any UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then formulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the conjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered around comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the Bekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the area law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of cosmological horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>Polar Mounds on Strangeon Stars: the Neutrino Emission from Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) serve as unique astrophysical laboratories, offering critical insights into accretion physics under extreme conditions, such as strong magnetic fields and super-Eddington accretion rates. Additionally, the nature of pulsars, i.e., the equation of state of supranuclear matter, is still a matter of intense debate, basing on either conventional neutron stars or strange stars in the litterateurs. In this work, we investigate accretion columns of ULXPs based on the strangeon-star model, focusing on the thermal mound at the column base. Accounting for Coulomb and strangeness barriers of the strangeon stars, we find that the mound can reach $0.7-0.95\,\rm km$ in height with temperatures above $10^9\, \rm K$, enabling substantial neutrino emission via electron-positron annihilation. Heat transport along the strangeon star surface contributes a luminosity of $10^{36} \, \rm erg\, s^{-1} $, independent of the accretion rate. At low accretion rates ($&lt; 10^{20}\, \rm g\,s^{-1}$), photons dominate the luminosity, while at higher rates ($&gt; 10^{21}\, \rm g\, s^{-1}$), photon trapping makes neutrino emission the main cooling channel, with total luminosity exceeding photon emission, which saturates near $10^{41}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Estimating neutrino fluxes at Earth, we find that only the nearest ULXP, Swift J0243.6$+$6124, could produce a marginally detectable signal, while most extragalactic sources remain well below background levels. These results emphasize the key role of the thermal mound and strangeon star properties in determining accretion luminosities and neutrino emission, offering insights for future modeling and observations of ULXPs.</description>

      <title>The effect of matter discreteness on gravitational wave propagation in post-geometrical optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

Abstract: We construct a limit of Hamiltonian gravity as the determinant of the spatial triad (and hence of the four-metric) goes to zero. Within the Barbero-Immirzi SU (2) formulation, we present two possible realizations of this limit, with the consequence that the Hamiltonian constraint becomes simpler and spatial diffeomorphisms become trivial. In the first case, the Hamiltonian constraint exhibits a polynomial structure, being formally similar to the Euclidean Hamitonian constraint of Sen-Ashtekar self-dual formulation. In the latter, the constraints become free from ordering ambiguity. Further, we show that the Carrollian gravity emerges as a special case of this degenerate limit, thus providing it a new geometric interpretation independent of the speed of light or any dimensionful coupling constant (G).</description>

Abstract: We analyze the effect of higher order viscosity corrections in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe. The viscous effects are modeled by introducing a second-order term to the energy density in the equation of state and on the expansion factor. An autonomous dynamical system is then constructed to study the qualitative behavior of the energy density and expansion factor, employing the Raychaudhuri equation and the conservation of energy. We obtain the analytical expressions for the equilibrium points in terms of the model parameters, presenting several phase diagrams. The analysis of these diagrams reveals the presence of bifurcations, which manifest as changes in stability and qualitative behavior. Those changes lead to different configurations for the universe, such as bouncing, rebouncing and cyclic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in The Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. The production of PBHs through well-tested and accepted physical processes is highly worthy of investigation. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations in energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formation in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the most viable ``asteroid mass'' window from the present-day observations, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings suggest that PBHs produced during magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the very early universe may comprise a dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Lagrangian formulation for gravity with matter where the gravitational couplings are universally treated as being field-dependent. The solutions for FLRW geometries and the associated time evolution of the Newton and cosmological couplings are found. The distance-redshift relations are shown to prefer a slowly growing Newton's coupling along with a negative equation of state ($w\geq -\frac{1}{3}$) for the matter fluid at the present epoch of accelerated expansion, while ruling out Dirac's large number hypothesis. We obtain an improved bound on $\dot{G}(t)$ as: $1.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{G}}{G}&lt;3.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$ in the context of supernova cosmology, as well as a new constraint on $\dot{\Lambda}(t)$ as: $-0.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{\Lambda}}{\Lambda}&lt;-1.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$. Based on this formulation, we also present a dynamical solution to the `cosmic coincidence' problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

Abstract: We study the 4D Einstein-Hilbert action extension based on the square of the curvature tensors. Analyses of gauge and perturbation modes are often done considering the Teyssandier gauge condition. Although this approach can be useful for other higher-order extensions of quadratic gravity, a generalized transverse (or Lorentz) gauge is clear and sufficient for the present case, as explained here. We provide a detailed analysis of the generalized transverse gauge condition, its residual gauge symmetry, the physical modes, the induced energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of the massive spin-2 mode (which is gauge-dependent), and a comparison with the Teyssandier gauge. The derivation is valid for any EMT. We also compare the induced EMT in quadratic gravity with the massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli EMT, which is different from the previous cases. The comparison is further developed by considering a spherical isothermal sphere, which works as an approximation to virialized spherical systems.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <title>Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yes, it can.
  Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Gravitational Phenomena in Higher-Order Curvature-Scalar Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning to assess astrophysical origin of gravitational waves triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a possible application of a machine learning classifier for candidate events in a template-based search for gravitational-wave (GW) signals from various compact system sources. We analyze data from the O3a and O3b data acquisition campaign, during which the sensitivity of ground-based detectors is limited by real non-Gaussian noise transient. The state-of-the-art searches for such signals tipically rely on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a chi-square test to assess the consistency of the signal with an inspiral template. In addition, a combination of these and other statistical properties are used to build a 're-weighted SNR' statistics. We evaluate a Random Forest classifiers on a set of double-coincidence events identified using the MBTA pipeline. The new classifier achieves a modest but consistent increase in event detection at low false positive rates relative to the standard search. Using the output statistics from the Random Forest classifier, we compute the probability of astrophysical origin for each event, denoted as $p_\mathrm{astro}$. This is then evaluated for the events listed in existing catalogs, with results consistent with those from the standard search. Finally, we search for new possible candidates using this new statistics, with $p_\mathrm{astro} &gt; 0.5$, obtaining a new subthreshold candidate (IFAR =0.05) event at $gps: 1240423628$ .</description>

      <title>Non-linear instability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic scalar perturbations on a fixed slowly rotating Kerr-AdS black hole background exhibit stable trapping, that is, the scalar field remains in a region between the exterior of the black hole and the AdS boundary for a very long time, decaying only inverse logarithmically in time. We study this effect employing fully general simulations that take into account the non-linear backreaction of the scalar field on the geometry. We find that the stable trapping of generic perturbations of Kerr-AdS persists at the non-linear level. Furthermore, the spacetime settles into a time-dependant and non-axisymmetric black hole which differs from Kerr-AdS. Since our perturbations are generic, our results indicate that slowly rotating Kerr-AdS black holes are non-linearly unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor as a necessary element in the geometric classification of nonlinear responses and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in [arXiv:2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in five-dimensional AdS where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</description>

      <title>Area and volume as emergent phenomena from entangled qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a connection has been shown between certain geometric quantities and quantum information theory. In this paper, we demonstrate that geometric quantities such as area and volume can emerge directly from entangled multi-qubit states. In particular, the area of a two-dimensional parallelogram is derived from a 4-qubit entangled state, the vector area of a three-dimensional parallelogram from three 6-qubit entangled states, and the volume of a three-dimensional parallelepiped from a 9-qubit entangled state. Corresponding quantum circuits are constructed and implemented using Qiskit to generate the required entangled states. Given that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as elementary building blocks for more complex geometric structures, these results may offer a pathway toward exploring emergent geometry in quantum information frameworks</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into classical and Topological CFT Thermodynamics in Lifshitz and Hyperscaling Violating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence, a precise set of rules must be established to guide the translation of computed quantities in the gravitational sector into their CFT counterparts, and vice versa. This framework is commonly referred to as the holographic dictionary. The formulation of such dictionaries opens a two-way gateway, allowing researchers to extend theoretical principles and findings from one domain into the other for further exploration and study. The development of a holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models \cite{6} has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, identifying critical points to examine the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we will study phase transitions and then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. In the next step, to compare both methodologies and highlight their equivalence, particularly demonstrating the accessibility of the topological method compared to the classical approach, we will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the (flat) $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling + BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analysis highlights the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative statistical analysis of two Dirac--Born--Infeld (DBI) type k-essence scalar field models (Model I and Model II) for late-time cosmic acceleration, alongside the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM benchmarks. The models are constrained using a joint dataset comprising Pantheon+, Hubble parameter measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), including the latest DESI DR2 release. To ensure efficient and accurate likelihood evaluations, we employ Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in \texttt{NumPyro}, supplemented with a machine learning (ML) emulator. Model selection is performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results demonstrate excellent consistency between the MCMC and ML emulator approaches. Compared to the reference models, $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, Model I yields the lowest $\chi^2$ and a negative $\Delta$AIC relative to $\Lambda$CDM, indicating a mild statistical preference for its richer late-time dynamics, though the BIC penalizes its additional parameter and prevents a decisive advantage. Conversely, Model II has a lower accuracy compared to both $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM according to AIC and BIC, leading to its disfavor. Notably, Model I also delivers $H_0=73.67\pm0.15$ (without the nuisance parameter $\mu_0$) in agreement with SH0ES, and $H_0=69.65\pm0.83$ (with $\mu_0$) as an intermediate value, thereby reconciling with local measurements while simultaneously providing a compromise between early and late universe determinations. This dual feature offers a promising pathway toward alleviating the Hubble tension. Overall, our analysis highlights the significance of non-canonical scalar field models as viable alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, which often provide improved fits to current observational data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that there exists an $s$-channel sequence of classical corrections to the $H$ diagram computed long ago by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. At leading logarithmic accuracy, those corrections feature the gravity BFKL kernel as a crucial element, and may be computed through either rapidity renormalisation group equations or amplitudes built through $s$-channel unitarity cuts. In this paper, we evaluate six-graviton amplitudes in next-to-multi-Regge kinematics, and compute for the first time the Central Emission Vertex for the emission of two gravitons, which is relevant to evaluate the corrections to the gravity BFKL kernel, and thus to go beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

  We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic K\"ahler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
  We classify viable models by enforcing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, allowing trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure leads to finite geodesic distance and a stabilized gravitino mass, conditionally avoiding towers of light states and remaining consistent with the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. At the same time, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, situating the infrared boundary at infinite dynamical distance.
  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Strongly Magnetized Eccentric Neutron Star Binaries</title>

Abstract: We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields as high as $ \sim 10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO (O5) is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim 1\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable to 700 Mpc. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetic effects in binaries.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>
