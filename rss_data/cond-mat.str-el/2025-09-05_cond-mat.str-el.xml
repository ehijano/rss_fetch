      <title>A new rung on the ladder: exploring topological frustration towards two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism vs. Antiferromagnetism in Narrow-Band Systems: Competition Between Quantum Geometry and Band Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in narrow-band systems arises from the interplay between electronic correlations, quantum geometry, and band dispersion. In particular, both ferro and anti-ferro magnets are known to occur as ground states of (different) models featuring narrow bands. This poses the question of which is favored and under what conditions. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework to investigate spin physics within narrow bands. By deriving an effective spin model, we show that the non-atomic wavefunction of the narrow bands generally favors ferromagnetic ordering, while band dispersion promotes antiferromagnetic correlations. We find that the competition between these effects gives rise to a tunable magnetic phase and rich spin phenomena. Our approach offers a systematic way to study the magnetic properties of narrow-band systems, integrating the roles of wave function, band structure, and correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of bulk and entanglement phase transitions in the Haldane phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum (ES) of the spin-1/2 ladder in the Haldane phase, long believed to exhibit a des Cloizeaux-Pearson (dCP)-type $\sin|k|$ dispersion. Using exact diagonalization up to 40 spins, we resolve two distinct branches at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$, which were previously interpreted as a single smooth mode due to SU(2) degeneracy and limited resolution. Breaking SU(2) symmetry via XXZ anisotropy opens a spin or neutral gap at $k=\pi$, depending on the anisotropy direction, triggering an entanglement quantum phase transition that is disconnected from the bulk critical point. In the easy-plane regime, the entanglement ground state is unique in the $S_A^z=0$ sector but becomes quasi-degenerate across $S_A^z$ sectors in the thermodynamic limit, consistent with spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking. This separation between bulk and entanglement transitions demonstrates that the Li-Haldane correspondence can fail in topological ladders, even at the level of low-energy dispersions. These results revise the prevailing picture of ES in spin ladders under extensive bipartitioning, and suggest that the entanglement Hamiltonian, being nonlocal, can circumvent conventional constraints such as the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis and Mermin-Wagner theorems.</description>

      <title>Mott Glass and Criticality in a S=1/2 Bilayer Heisenberg Model with Interlayer Bond Dilution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) method to investigate the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a bilayer square lattice with diluted interlayer couplings. Both regular and random dilution patterns are considered. In systems with regular dilution, tuning the interlayer interaction drives a quantum phase transition from a N\'eel-ordered phase to a quantum disordered phase, consistent with the $O(3)$ universality class. In contrast, random dilution gives rise to a two-step transition: from the N\'eel phase to an intermediate Mott glass (MG) phase, followed by a transition to the quantum disordered phase. Within the MG phase, the uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibits a stretched-exponential temperature dependence $\chi_u \sim \exp(-b/T^\alpha)$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. At the N\'eel-to-glass transition, quenched disorder modifies the critical exponents in a manner consistent with the Harris criterion. These findings provide new insights into disorder-driven quantum phase transitions and the emergence of glassy phases in diluted bilayer quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Geometric Effects on Tunneling in Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review quantum tunneling provoked by external field driving, focusing on the role of geometric effects. The discussion begins with an overview of tunneling phenomena, including the Landau-Zener model and the Schwinger effect, both of which are essential frameworks to describe the generation of elementary excitation of the system. We also refer to the relation between the modern theory of polarization and the geometry of the system, and introduce the shift vector via adiabatic perturbation theory. Then we introduce the twisted Landau-Zener model and shown how the shift vector modulates tunneling probability, followed by several illustrative applications of this model. We also explain the Keldysh crossover, which is the crossover from a quantum tunneling regime to photon absorption regime in driven systems.</description>

      <title>Twisted quantum doubles are sign problem-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign problem is one of the central obstacles to efficiently simulating quantum many-body systems. It is commonly believed that some phases of matter, such as the double semion model, have an intrinsic sign problem and can never be realized in a local sign problem-free Hamiltonian due to the non-positivity of the wavefunction. We show that this is not the case. Despite failing to be stoquastic - the standard criteria for the existence of a sign problem - the double semion model as well as all twisted quantum double phases of matter for finite groups $\mathcal{G}$ can be realized in local sign problem-free Hamiltonians. The lack of a sign problem is not fine-tuned and does not require the Hamiltonian to be exactly solvable, with sign problem-free perturbations allowing access to a variety of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>

      <title>Switching topological states via uniaxial strain in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, dissipationless edge currents are protected against local defect scattering by the bulk inverted band structure and band gap. We propose that large uniaxial strain can effectively switch a 2D Chern insulator to a topologically trivial state. Further, we suggest that the boundary between strained and unstrained regions of a sample can act as a new edge for dissipationless current flow. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations we demonstrate the strain-tunability of the monolayer MnBi2S2T2 band structure and the switching of the Chern number. We combine uniaxial and biaxial strain results to map out the strain-tuned topological phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated electrons in superconducting islands with fluctuating Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a particle-number conserving theory for many-body effects in mesoscopic superconducting islands connected to normal electrodes, which explicitly includes quantum fluctuations of Cooper pairs in the condensate. Beyond previous BCS mean-field descriptions, our theory can precisely treat the pairing and Coulomb interactions over an unprecedentedly broad range of parameters by using the numerical renormalization group method. On increasing the ratio of pairing to Coulomb interactions, the low-energy physics of the system evolves from the spin Kondo to mixed valence regimes and eventually reaches an anisotropic charge Kondo phase, while a crossover from $1e$- to $2e$-periodic Coulomb blockade of transport is revealed at high temperatures. For weak pairing, the superconducting condensate is frozen in the local spin-flip processes but fluctuates in the virtual excitations, yielding an enhanced spin Kondo temperature. For strong pairing, massive fluctuations of Cooper pairs are crucial for establishing charge Kondo correlations whose Kondo temperature rapidly decreases with the pairing interaction. Surprisingly, a charge-exchange induced local field may occur even at the charge degenerate point, thereby destroying the charge Kondo effect. These are demonstrated in the spectral and transport properties of the island.</description>

      <title>Frustration-enhanced persistent currents in correlated trimer nanorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the persistent current in a correlated trimer nanoring comprising of three magnetic atoms, which sits on a metallic host and encloses a magnetic flux. In the molecular-orbital regime, charge fluctuations can reverse the aromaticity of the trimer molecule by driving quantum phase transitions between many-body states. It is shown that in frustrated trimers the superexchange-induced current as a function of interatom hopping is enhanced by the competition of conflicting magnetic orders, with an asymmetric peak at the quantum criticality separating the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kondo regimes. Interestingly, the critical current undergoes an anomalous rise with temperature before decaying, signaling the suppression of Kondo bound state at finite temperature. Our results demonstrate that the coherent current response to external flux indeed conveys important information on the states of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined computational and experimental study of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a correlated layered material containing Nb trimers, through the lens of competing intra- and intercluster interactions. Different proposed explanations for its magnetostructural transition such as charge disproportionation, antiferromagnetic quenching, and interlayer singlet formation are investigated in light of the various reported low-temperature structures. Our findings rule out the previously proposed charge-disproportionation, suggest an intricate interplay between Mott physics and the formation of interlayer singlets, and also hint at a possible explanation of the observed intratrimer scissoring distortion. We suggest that the physics of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ should be understood in the context of weakly coupled Hubbard dimers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic behavior of $5d^1$ Re-based double perovskite Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.222~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Emergence of quantum spin liquid and spin-flop phase in Kitaev antiferromagnets in a [111] magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral Graviton Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations. Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states, capturing both spin-2 and spin-3/2 neutral modes.</description>

      <title>Magic continuum in multi-moir\'e twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices provide a highly tunable platform for exploring the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology. Introducing a second moir\'e pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two moir\'e patterns produces a supermoir\'e modulation, opening a route to further tailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies such a system: two distinct moir\'e patterns arise from the relative twists between adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated phenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist angles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space. Depending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls into two classes: moir\'e polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with locally commensurate moir\'e order, and moir\'e quasicrystals, characterized by smoothly varying local moir\'e configurations. In helically twisted moir\'e polycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological bands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast, superconductivity appears generically in our moir\'e quasicrystals. A subset of these systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity, which we attribute to the supermoir\'e structure. Our findings uncover the organizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer graphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoir\'e modulation and lattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions arise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the multi-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moir\'e materials.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Disjoint additivity and local quantum physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems of physical interest are often local, but there are at least three competing perspectives on how "locality" should be formalized: an algebraic framework, a path-integral framework, and a lattice framework. One puzzle in this competition is that systems with higher-form symmetries, which are perfectly local from the path-integral and lattice perspectives, can violate the algebraic principle of "additivity". In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, "disjoint additivity", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local "SymTFT" system in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Trading Mathematical for Physical Simplicity: Bialgebraic Structures in Matrix Product Operator Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in the lattice representation theory of (generalized) symmetries, many simple quantum spin chains of physical interest are not included in the rigid framework of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Three-channel charge Kondo model at high transparency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum impurity models involving a localized charge that is weakly coupled to electronic leads usually map to Kondo-like Hamiltonians that exhibit various quantum critical behaviors. Here, we address the opposite regime of high contact transparency by solving the model of a quantum island coupled to three quantum Hall edge channels. Using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a nonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear conductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the zero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the three-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all transparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to the pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed points as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the interactions, changes. Our work demonstrates that FRG methods are an efficient tool for solving quantum impurity problems in regimes where standard approaches fail.</description>

      <title>Proximitizing altermagnets with conventional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work highlighted unique properties of superconducting altermagnets, including the wealth of topologically non-trivial phases as well as their potential uses in spintronic applications. Given that no intrinsically superconducting altermagnets have yet been discovered, we study here the possibility of superconducting order induced by proximity effect from a conventional s-wave superconductor. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling we find that interesting superconducting phases can indeed be proximity-induced in a thin altermagnetic film provided that weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present at the interface. Surprisingly, the resulting superconductor is generically nodal with a mixed singlet/triplet order parameter and, importantly for applications, capable of generating spin-polarized persistent current. We propose a set of candidate heterostructures with low lattice mismatch suitable to probe these effects experimentally.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quadratic Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate minimal two-body Hamiltonians with random interactions that generate spectra resembling those of Gaussian random matrices, a phenomenon we term quadratic quantum chaos. Unlike integrable two-body fermionic systems, the corresponding hard-core boson models exhibit genuinely chaotic dynamics, closely paralleling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in its spin representation. This chaotic behavior is diagnosed through spectral statistics and measures of operator growth, including Krylov complexity and the late-time decay of higher-order out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs); the latter reveals the emergence of freeness in the sense of free probability. Moreover, the fractal dimension and Stabilizer Renyi entropy of a representative mid-spectrum eigenstate show finite-size deviations yet converge toward Haar-randomness as the system size increases. This convergence, constrained by local interactions, highlights the "weakly chaotic" character of these eigenstates. Owing to its simplicity and bosonic nature, these minimal models may constitute promising and resource-efficient candidates for probing quantum chaos and information scrambling on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of quantum field theory by introducing a general class of discrete gauge theories that realize either topological order or fracton behavior across dimensions. We start from translation-invariant systems endowed with unconventional charge-conservation laws, which we term \textit{exponential polynomial symmetries}. Gauging these symmetries yields $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories in 2D that exhibit topological order whose quasiparticles have constrained mobility and whose ground-state degeneracy shows ultraviolet (UV) dependence. These features are reminiscent of spatial symmetry-enriched topological order, wherein quasiparticle excitations transform nontrivially under lattice translations. We further propose a Chern-Simons variant that produces non-CSS stabilizer codes and outline a framework for exponentially symmetric subsystem SPT phases. Finally, we extend this gauging procedure to 3D, obtaining new variants of fracton topological order.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}\simeq 0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the role of lattice vibrations in the formation of the pseudogap state in strongly correlated electron systems has been investigated concerning changes in the electron-phonon coupling parameters and the concentration of doped charge carriers. We apply the polaronic version of the generalized tight-binding method to analyze the band structure of a realistic multiband two-dimensional model that incorporates the electron-lattice contributions of both Holstein and Peierls types. It has been demonstrated that the emergence of polaronic effects begins with the modulation of spectral function intensity. However, within a specific region of the phase diagram, a significant transformation of the electron band structure and pseudogap state occurs. It results from coherent polaron excitations that create a partially flat band near the Fermi level. This process leads to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface and the emergence of corresponding features in the density of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a Landau treatment of the incommensurate density wave transition observed in trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and uses this to address the nature of the transition. The data are consistent with a spin driven transition with the distinct intertwining of charge and spin order due to being in or proximate to the first order transition region of the Landau phase diagram. From this approach, one also obtains an understanding of the variation of the transition temperature with rare earth size, pressure, and oxygen isotope substitution.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>

Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics, paving the way for experimental validation of our predictions and their application in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolving superconductivity in type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity is identified by the emergence of a macroscopic zero-resistance state, typically inferred from a vanishing four-probe voltage at finite current. That inference assumes spatially uniform conduction-e.g., at least one continuous superconducting path between the current leads and voltage electrodes that sample a finite potential gradient-and can fail if the drive current bypasses the electrodes or if narrow filaments short the current contacts. Here we introduce a methodology to test these assumptions in superconductors, by using spatially resolved measurements of local variations in dc using cryogenic conductive atomic-force microscopy (cAFM). Using Fe(Se,Te) as a model system, we find that despite bulk measurements consistent with a homogeneous superconducting state, the material exhibits a heterogeneous conducting landscape: micrometre-scale superconducting regions coexist with relatively insulating areas. We further show that cAFM resolves conductance fluctuations at 20 K (&gt; TC) that vary between repeated scans, consistent with expectations for short-lived, pre-formed Cooper pairs in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. These results establish cAFM as a practical tool to validate assumptions underlying four-probe transport and underscore the need for direct spatial probes in materials whose macroscopic response can conceal nanoscale inhomogeneity. Accurate identification of macroscopic properties is critical for materials classes like superconductors that are defined by their macroscopic properties.</description>
