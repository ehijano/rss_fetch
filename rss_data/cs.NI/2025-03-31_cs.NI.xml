      <title>Enhancing Mobile Crowdsensing Efficiency: A Coverage-aware Resource Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the resource management challenges in next-generation mobile crowdsensing networks with the goal of minimizing task completion latency while ensuring coverage performance, i.e., an essential metric to ensure comprehensive data collection across the monitored area, yet it has been commonly overlooked in existing studies. To this end, we formulate a weighted latency and coverage gap minimization problem via jointly optimizing user selection, subchannel allocation, and sensing task allocation. The formulated minimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer programming issue. To facilitate the analysis, we decompose the original optimization problem into two subproblems. One focuses on optimizing sensing task and subband allocation under fixed sensing user selection, which is optimally solved by the Hungarian algorithm via problem reformulation. Building upon these findings, we introduce a time-efficient two-sided swapping method to refine the scheduled user set and enhance system performance. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to various benchmark strategies.</description>

      <title>Reliability and Availability in Virtualized Networks: A Survey on Standards, Modeling Approaches, and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has transformed network infrastructures by replacing fixed hardware with software-based Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), enabling greater agility, scalability, and cost efficiency. Virtualization increases the distribution of system components and introduces stronger interdependencies. As a result, failures become harder to predict, monitor, and manage compared to traditional monolithic networks. Reliability, i.e. the ability of a system to perform regularly under specified conditions, and availability, i.e. the probability of a system of being ready to use, are critical requirements that must be guaranteed to maintain seamless network operations. Accurate modeling of these aspects is crucial for designing robust, fault-tolerant virtualized systems that can withstand service disruptions. This survey focuses on reliability and availability attributes of virtualized networks from a modeling perspective. After introducing the NFV architecture and basic definitions, we discuss the standardization efforts of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), which provides guidelines and recommendations through a series of standard documents focusing on reliability and availability. Next, we explore several formalisms proposed in the literature for characterizing reliability and availability, with a focus on their application to modeling the failure and repair behavior of virtualized networks through practical examples. Then, we overview numerous references demonstrating how different authors adopt specific methods to characterize reliability and/or availability of virtualized systems. Moreover, we present a selection of the most valuable software tools that support modeling of reliable virtualized networks. Finally, we discuss a set of open problems with the aim to encourage readers to explore further advances in this field.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Service Restoration in 5G Optical Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only the chairs can edit The rapid growth of high-bandwidth applications in fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond has driven a substantial increase in traffic within transport optical networks. While network slicing effectively addresses diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements-including bit rate, latency, and reliability-it also amplifies vulnerabilities to failures, particularly when a single disruption in the optical layer impacts multiple services within the 5G network. To address these challenges, we propose a Fast Disrupted Service Prioritization (FDSP) algorithm that strategically allocates resources to the most critical disrupted services. Specifically, FDSP employs a fast-solving integer linear programming (ILP) model to evaluate three key factors-service priority, bit rate, and remaining holding time-and integrates a physical-layer impairment (PLI)-aware routing and spectrum allocation approach. By leveraging this combined strategy, FDSP minimizes service disruption while optimizing resource utilization. Simulation results on Germany's network demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of survivable 5G slicing, thereby reducing blocking probability.</description>

      <title>NetSSM: Multi-Flow and State-Aware Network Trace Generation using State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to raw network traffic data is essential for many computer networking tasks, from traffic modeling to performance evaluation. Unfortunately, this data is scarce due to high collection costs and governance rules. Previous efforts explore this challenge by generating synthetic network data, but fail to reliably handle multi-flow sessions, struggle to reason about stateful communication in moderate to long-duration network sessions, and lack robust evaluations tied to real-world utility. We propose a new method based on state-space models called NetSSM that generates raw network traffic at the packet-level granularity. Our approach captures interactions between multiple, interleaved flows -- an objective unexplored in prior work -- and effectively reasons about flow-state in sessions to capture traffic characteristics. NetSSM accomplishes this by learning from and producing traces 8x and 78x longer than existing transformer-based approaches. Evaluation results show that our method generates high-fidelity traces that outperform prior efforts in existing benchmarks. We also find that NetSSM's traces have high semantic similarity to real network data regarding compliance with standard protocol requirements and flow and session-level traffic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Route-and-Aggregate Decentralized Federated Learning Under Communication Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (D-FL) allows clients to aggregate learning models locally, offering flexibility and scalability. Existing D-FL methods use gossip protocols, which are inefficient when not all nodes in the network are D-FL clients. This paper puts forth a new D-FL strategy, termed Route-and-Aggregate (R&amp;A) D-FL, where participating clients exchange models with their peers through established routes (as opposed to flooding) and adaptively normalize their aggregation coefficients to compensate for communication errors. The impact of routing and imperfect links on the convergence of R&amp;A D-FL is analyzed, revealing that convergence is minimized when routes with the minimum end-to-end packet error rates are employed to deliver models. Our analysis is experimentally validated through three image classification tasks and two next-word prediction tasks, utilizing widely recognized datasets and models. R&amp;A D-FL outperforms the flooding-based D-FL method in terms of training accuracy by 35% in our tested 10-client network, and shows strong synergy between D-FL and networking. In another test with 10 D-FL clients, the training accuracy of R&amp;A D-FL with communication errors approaches that of the ideal C-FL without communication errors, as the number of routing nodes (i.e., nodes that do not participate in the training of D-FL) rises to 28.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Secure Neighbor Discovery for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22232v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Secure Neighbor Discovery (SND) are key elements for network functionality. SND is a hard problem, satisfying not only typical security properties (authentication, integrity) but also verification of direct communication, which involves distance estimation based on time measurements and device coordinates. Defeating relay attacks, also known as "wormholes", leading to stealthy Byzantine links and significant degradation of communication and adversarial control, is key in many wireless networked systems. However, SND is not concerned with privacy; it necessitates revealing the identity and location of the device(s) participating in the protocol execution. This can be a deterrent for deployment, especially involving user-held devices in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart environments. To address this challenge, we present a novel Privacy-Preserving Secure Neighbor Discovery (PP-SND) protocol, enabling devices to perform SND without revealing their actual identities and locations, effectively decoupling discovery from the exposure of sensitive information. We use Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for computing device distances without revealing their actual coordinates, as well as employing a pseudonymous device authentication to hide identities while preserving communication integrity. PP-SND provides SND [1] along with pseudonymity, confidentiality, and unlinkability. Our presentation here is not specific to one wireless technology, and we assess the performance of the protocols (cryptographic overhead) on a Raspberry Pi 4 and provide a security and privacy analysis.</description>

      <title>Training Large Language Models for Advanced Typosquatting Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typosquatting is a long-standing cyber threat that exploits human error in typing URLs to deceive users, distribute malware, and conduct phishing attacks. With the proliferation of domain names and new Top-Level Domains (TLDs), typosquatting techniques have grown more sophisticated, posing significant risks to individuals, businesses, and national cybersecurity infrastructure. Traditional detection methods primarily focus on well-known impersonation patterns, leaving gaps in identifying more complex attacks. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance typosquatting detection. By training an LLM on character-level transformations and pattern-based heuristics rather than domain-specific data, a more adaptable and resilient detection mechanism develops. Experimental results indicate that the Phi-4 14B model outperformed other tested models when properly fine tuned achieving a 98% accuracy rate with only a few thousand training samples. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in cybersecurity applications, specifically in mitigating domain-based deception tactics, and provides insights into optimizing machine learning strategies for threat detection.</description>

      <title>COLoRIS: Localization-agnostic Smart Surfaces Enabling Opportunistic ISAC in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Smart Surfaces in 6G communication networks, also dubbed as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), is a promising paradigm change gaining significant attention given its disruptive features. RISs are a key enabler in the realm of 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems where novel services can be offered together with the future mobile networks communication capabilities. This paper addresses the critical challenge of precisely localizing users within a communication network by leveraging the controlled-reflective properties of RIS elements without relying on more power-hungry traditional methods, e.g., GPS, adverting the need of deploying additional infrastructure and even avoiding interfering with communication efforts. Moreover, we go one step beyond: we build COLoRIS, an Opportunistic ISAC approach that leverages localization-agnostic RIS configurations to accurately position mobile users via trained learning models. Extensive experimental validation and simulations in large-scale synthetic scenarios show 5% positioning errors (with respect to field size) under different conditions. Further, we show that a low-complexity version running in a limited off-the-shelf (embedded, low-power) system achieves positioning errors in the 11% range at a negligible +2.7% energy expense with respect to the classical RIS.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Impact of 5G Jitter on Time-Aware Shaper Scheduling in a 5G-TSN Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic communications are essential for industrial automation, ensuring strict latency requirements and minimal jitter in packet transmission. Modern production lines, specializing in robotics, require higher flexibility and mobility, which drives the integration of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G networks in Industry 4.0. TSN achieves deterministic communications by using mechanisms such as the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which schedules packet transmissions within precise cycles, thereby reducing latency, jitter, and congestion. 5G networks complement TSN by providing wireless mobility and supporting ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications. However, 5G channel effects such as fast fading, interference, and network-induced latency and jitter can disrupt TSN traffic, potentially compromising deterministic scheduling and performance. This paper presents an empirical analysis of 5G network latency and jitter on IEEE 802.1Qbv performance in a 5G-TSN network. We evaluate the impact of 5G integration on TSN's deterministic scheduling through a testbed combining IEEE 802.1Qbv-enabled switches, TSN translators, and a commercial 5G system. Our results show that, with proper TAS configuration in the TSN switch aligned with the 5G system, jitter can be mitigated, maintaining deterministic performance.</description>
