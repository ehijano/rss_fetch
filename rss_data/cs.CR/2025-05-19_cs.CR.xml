      <title>Hybrid Privacy Policy-Code Consistency Check using Knowledge Graphs and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing concern in user privacy misuse has accelerated research into checking consistencies between smartphone apps' declared privacy policies and their actual behaviors. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced promising techniques for semantic comparison, but these methods often suffer from low accuracies and expensive computational costs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates 1) knowledge graph-based deterministic checking to ensure higher accuracy, and 2) LLMs exclusively used for preliminary semantic analysis to save computational costs. Preliminary evaluation indicates this hybrid approach not only achieves 37.63% increase in precision and 23.13% increase F1-score but also consumes 93.5% less tokens and 87.3% shorter time.</description>

      <title>MorphMark: Flexible Adaptive Watermarking for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking by altering token sampling probabilities based on red-green list is a promising method for tracing the origin of text generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing watermark methods often struggle with a fundamental dilemma: improving watermark effectiveness (the detectability of the watermark) often comes at the cost of reduced text quality. This trade-off limits their practical application. To address this challenge, we first formalize the problem within a multi-objective trade-off analysis framework. Within this framework, we identify a key factor that influences the dilemma. Unlike existing methods, where watermark strength is typically treated as a fixed hyperparameter, our theoretical insights lead to the development of MorphMarka method that adaptively adjusts the watermark strength in response to changes in the identified factor, thereby achieving an effective resolution of the dilemma. In addition, MorphMark also prioritizes flexibility since it is a model-agnostic and model-free watermark method, thereby offering a practical solution for real-world deployment, particularly in light of the rapid evolution of AI models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MorphMark achieves a superior resolution of the effectiveness-quality dilemma, while also offering greater flexibility and time and space efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity threat detection based on a UEBA framework using Deep Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.</description>

      <title>On Technique Identification and Threat-Actor Attribution using LLMs and Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribution of cyber-attacks remains a complex but critical challenge for cyber defenders. Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from dense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially following major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates large language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral indicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and text-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data from MITRE ATT&amp;CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using vector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a machine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing off-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an end-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction. This research finds that standard LLMs generate TTP datasets with noise, resulting in a low similarity to human-generated datasets. However, the TTPs generated are similar in frequency to those within the existing MITRE datasets. Additionally, although these TTPs are different than human-generated datasets, our work demonstrates that they still prove useful for training a model that performs above baseline on attribution.

      <title>One Shot Dominance: Knowledge Poisoning Attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses. However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly accessible and modifiable. Poisoning attacks on knowledge bases for RAG systems face two fundamental challenges: the injected malicious content must compete with multiple authentic documents retrieved by the retriever, and LLMs tend to trust retrieved information that aligns with their internal memorized knowledge. Previous works attempt to address these challenges by injecting multiple malicious documents, but such saturation attacks are easily detectable and impractical in real-world scenarios. To enable the effective single document poisoning attack, we propose AuthChain, a novel knowledge poisoning attack method that leverages Chain-of-Evidence theory and authority effect to craft more convincing poisoned documents. AuthChain generates poisoned content that establishes strong evidence chains and incorporates authoritative statements, effectively overcoming the interference from both authentic documents and LLMs' internal knowledge. Extensive experiments across six popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Managerial Insights on Investment Strategy in Cybersecurity: Findings from Multi-Country Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the strategic role of cybersecurity based on survey data from 1,083 managers across Europe, the UK, and the United States. The findings indicate growing recognition of cybersecurity as a source of competitive advantage, although firms continue to face barriers such as limited resources, talent shortages, and cultural resistance. Larger and high-tech firms tend to adopt more proactive strategies, while SMEs and low-tech sectors display greater variability. Key managerial tensions emerge in balancing security with innovation and agility. Notable country-level differences are observed across Europe, the UK, and the United States. Across all contexts, leadership and employee engagement appear central to closing the gap between strategic intent and operational practice.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for In-Vehicle Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enhance mobility but face cybersecurity threats, particularly through the insecure Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Cyberattacks can have devastating consequences in connected vehicles, including the loss of control over critical systems, necessitating robust security solutions. In-vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) offer a promising approach by detecting malicious activities in real time. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research on learning-based in-vehicle IDSs, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Federated Learning (FL) approaches. Based on the reviewed studies, we critically examine existing IDS approaches, categorising them by the types of attacks they detect - known, unknown, and combined known-unknown attacks - while identifying their limitations. We also review the evaluation metrics used in research, emphasising the need to consider multiple criteria to meet the requirements of safety-critical systems. Additionally, we analyse FL-based IDSs and highlight their limitations. By doing so, this survey helps identify effective security measures, address existing limitations, and guide future research toward more resilient and adaptive protection mechanisms, ensuring the safety and reliability of CAVs.</description>

      <title>AC-LoRA: (Almost) Training-Free Access Control-Aware Multi-Modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate LLMs are gaining traction for efficient knowledge dissemination and management within organizations. However, as current LLMs are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information, it has proven difficult to apply them in settings where strict access control is necessary. To this end, we design AC-LoRA, an end-to-end system for access control-aware corporate LLM chatbots that maintains a strong information isolation guarantee. AC-LoRA maintains separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more than one LoRA is retrieved, without requiring any additional training for LoRA routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two datasets, and show that AC-LoRA matches or even exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art LoRA mixing techniques while providing strong isolation guarantees. Furthermore, we show that AC-LoRA design can be directly applied to different modalities.</description>

      <title>ACSE-Eval: Can LLMs threat model real-world cloud infrastructure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models have shown promise in cybersecurity applications, their effectiveness in identifying security threats within cloud deployments remains unexplored. This paper introduces AWS Cloud Security Engineering Eval, a novel dataset for evaluating LLMs cloud security threat modeling capabilities. ACSE-Eval contains 100 production grade AWS deployment scenarios, each featuring detailed architectural specifications, Infrastructure as Code implementations, documented security vulnerabilities, and associated threat modeling parameters. Our dataset enables systemic assessment of LLMs abilities to identify security risks, analyze attack vectors, and propose mitigation strategies in cloud environments. Our evaluations on ACSE-Eval demonstrate that GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at threat identification, with Gemini 2.5 Pro performing optimally in 0-shot scenarios and GPT 4.1 showing superior results in few-shot settings. While GPT 4.1 maintains a slight overall performance advantage, Claude 3.7 Sonnet generates the most semantically sophisticated threat models but struggles with threat categorization and generalization. To promote reproducibility and advance research in automated cybersecurity threat analysis, we open-source our dataset, evaluation metrics, and methodologies.</description>

      <title>Scaling an ISO Compliance Practice: Strategic Insights from Building a \$1m+ Cybersecurity Certification Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid exponential growth in cloud-first business models and tightened global data protection regulations have led to the exponential increase in the level of importance of ISO certifications, especially ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, and 27018, as strategic imperative propositions for organizations wanting to build trust, ensure compliance, and achieve a competitive advantage. This article describes a case study of a successful design, implementation, and scaling of a cybersecurity certification practice in Armanino LLP, a pioneering US accounting and consulting firm. In reaction to increasing client desires for formalized information security frameworks, I founded an industry practice from conception through implementation to aid mid-market and high-growth technology firms. During one year, the initiative brought in over \$1 million in new service revenue, expanded our portfolio of cybersecurity clients by 150%, and produced more than 20 successful ISO certifications on various verticals such as SaaS, healthcare, and fintech. Based on the strategic wisdom and operational strategy, this paper outlines the technical architecture of the ISO service line from modular audit templates to certification readiness kits, from stakeholder enablement to integration with SOC 2 and CIS controls. The approach gave value to repeatability, speed, and assurance, thus making Armanino a reputable certification body. The lessons drawn out provide us with a flexible template that can be utilized by firms wishing to build strong compliance programs that can be tailored to address changing digital risk terrains. This work adds to the increasing knowledge about audit scalability, cybersecurity compliance, and ISO standardisation.</description>

      <title>The Ripple Effect: On Unforeseen Complications of Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research highlights concerns about the trustworthiness of third-party Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) due to potential backdoor attacks. These backdoored PTLMs, however, are effective only for specific pre-defined downstream tasks. In reality, these PTLMs can be adapted to many other unrelated downstream tasks. Such adaptation may lead to unforeseen consequences in downstream model outputs, consequently raising user suspicion and compromising attack stealthiness. We refer to this phenomenon as backdoor complications. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive quantification of backdoor complications. Through extensive experiments using 4 prominent PTLMs and 16 text classification benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the widespread presence of backdoor complications in downstream models fine-tuned from backdoored PTLMs. The output distribution of triggered samples significantly deviates from that of clean samples. Consequently, we propose a backdoor complication reduction method leveraging multi-task learning to mitigate complications without prior knowledge of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reduce complications while maintaining the efficacy and consistency of backdoor attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Backdoor_Complications.</description>

      <title>Forensics of Error Rates of Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a rise in third-party cloud providers offering quantum hardware as a service to improve performance at lower cost. Although these providers provide flexibility to the users to choose from several qubit technologies, quantum hardware, and coupling maps; the actual execution of the program is not clearly visible to the customer. The success of the user program, in addition to various other metadata such as cost, performance, &amp; number of iterations to converge, depends on the error rate of the backend used. Moreover, the third-party provider and/or tools (e.g., hardware allocator and mapper) may hold insider/outsider adversarial agents to conserve resources and maximize profit by running the quantum circuits on error-prone hardware. Thus it is important to gain visibility of the backend from various perspectives of the computing process e.g., execution, transpilation and outcomes. In this paper, we estimate the error rate of the backend from the original and transpiled circuit. For the forensics, we exploit the fact that qubit mapping and routing steps of the transpilation process select qubits and qubit pairs with less single qubit and two-qubit gate errors to minimize overall error accumulation, thereby, giving us clues about the error rates of the various parts of the backend. We ranked qubit links into bins based on ECR error rates publicly available, and compared it to the rankings derived from our investigation of the relative frequency of a qubit link being chosen by the transpiler. For upto 83.5% of the qubit links in IBM Sherbrooke and 80% in IBM Brisbane, 127 qubit IBM backends, we are able to assign a bin rank which has a difference upto 2 with the bin rank assigned on the basis of actual error rate information.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Black Box: A Multi-Layer Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning-Based Cyber Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque, hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker agents that reveals both strategic (MDP-level) and tactical (policy-level) reasoning. At the MDP level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy level, we analyse the temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences. Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike previous explainable RL methods, which are often post-hoc, domain-specific, or limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic, supporting use cases ranging from red-team simulation to RL policy debugging. By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence, our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate, analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Inner-Product Functional Encryption: Noisy and Evasive Constructions from Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-authority attribute-based functional encryption for noisy inner-product functionality, and propose two new primitives: (1) multi-authority attribute-based (noisy) inner-product functional encryption (MA-AB(N)IPFE), which generalizes existing multi-authority attribute-based IPFE schemes by Agrawal et al. (TCC'21), by enabling approximate inner-product computation; and (2) multi-authority attribute-based evasive inner-product functional encryption (MA-evIPFE), a relaxed variant inspired by the evasive IPFE framework by Hsieh et al. (EUROCRYPT'24), shifting focus from ciphertext indistinguishability to a more relaxed pseudorandomness-based security notion. To support the above notions, we introduce two variants of lattice-based computational assumptions: evasive IPFE assumption and indistinguishability-based evasive IPFE assumption (IND-evIPFE). We present lattice-based constructions of both primitives for subset policies, building upon the framework of Waters et al.( TCC'22). Our schemes are proven to be statically secure in the random oracle model under the standard LWE assumption and the newly introduced assumptions. Additionally, we show our MA-AB(N)IPFE scheme can be transformed via modulus switching into a noiseless MA-IPFE scheme that supports exact inner-product functionality. This yields the first lattice-based construction of such a primitive. All our schemes support arbitrary polynomial-size attribute policies and are secure in the random oracle model under lattice assumptions with a sub-exponential modulus-to-noise ratio, making them practical candidates for noise-tolerant, fine-grained access control in multi-authority settings.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs in an Embodied Environment for Blue Team Threat Hlunting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we present CYBERTEAM, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CYBERTEAM constructs an embodied environment in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of embodied functions tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms the overall threat-hunting process into a structured sequence of function-driven operations, where each node represents a discrete function and edges define the execution order. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modular steps. Overall, CYBERTEAM integrates 30 tasks and 9 embodied functions, guiding LLMs through pipelined threat analysis. We evaluate leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CYBERTEAM's embodied function-calling against fundamental elicitation strategies. Our results offer valuable insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in threat hunting, laying the foundation for the practical adoption in real-world cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>MARVEL: Multi-Agent RTL Vulnerability Extraction using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware security verification is a challenging and time-consuming task. For this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification, linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making, tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests, LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>TechniqueRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Adversarial Technique Annotation in Cyber Threat Intelligence Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately identifying adversarial techniques in security texts is critical for effective cyber defense. However, existing methods face a fundamental trade-off: they either rely on generic models with limited domain precision or require resource-intensive pipelines that depend on large labeled datasets and task-specific optimizations, such as custom hard-negative mining and denoising, resources rarely available in specialized domains.
  We propose TechniqueRAG, a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that bridges this gap by integrating off-the-shelf retrievers, instruction-tuned LLMs, and minimal text-technique pairs. Our approach addresses data scarcity by fine-tuning only the generation component on limited in-domain examples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive retrieval training. While conventional RAG mitigates hallucination by coupling retrieval and generation, its reliance on generic retrievers often introduces noisy candidates, limiting domain-specific precision. To address this, we enhance retrieval quality and domain specificity through zero-shot LLM re-ranking, which explicitly aligns retrieved candidates with adversarial techniques.
  Experiments on multiple security benchmarks demonstrate that TechniqueRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance without extensive task-specific optimizations or labeled data, while comprehensive analysis provides further insights.</description>

      <title>A Human Study of Cognitive Biases in CTF Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity training has become a crucial part of computer science education and industrial onboarding. Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions have emerged as a valuable, gamified approach for developing and refining the skills of cybersecurity and software engineering professionals. However, while CTFs provide a controlled environment for tackling real world challenges, the participants' decision making and problem solving processes remain under explored. Recognizing that psychology may play a role in a cyber attacker's behavior, we investigate how cognitive biases could be used to improve CTF education and security. In this paper, we present an approach to control cognitive biases, specifically Satisfaction of Search and Loss Aversion, to influence and potentially hinder attackers' effectiveness against web application vulnerabilities in a CTF style challenge. We employ a rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis through a controlled human study of CTF tasks. CTF exercises are widely used in cybersecurity education and research to simulate real world attack scenarios and help participants develop critical skills by solving security challenges in controlled environments. In our study, participants interact with a web application containing deliberately embedded vulnerabilities while being subjected to tasks designed to trigger cognitive biases. Our study reveals that many participants exhibit the Satisfaction of Search bias and that this bias has a significant effect on their success. On average, participants found 25% fewer flags compared to those who did not exhibit this bias. Our findings provide valuable insights into how cognitive biases can be strategically employed to enhance cybersecurity outcomes, education, and measurements through the lens of CTF challenges.</description>

      <title>FL-PLAS: Federated Learning with Partial Layer Aggregation for Backdoor Defense Against High-Ratio Malicious Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is gaining increasing attention as an emerging collaborative machine learning approach, particularly in the context of large-scale computing and data systems. However, the fundamental algorithm of FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Although researchers have proposed numerous defense algorithms, two significant challenges remain. The attack is becoming more stealthy and harder to detect, and current defense methods are unable to handle 50\% or more malicious users or assume an auxiliary server dataset.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense algorithm, FL-PLAS, \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning based on \textbf{P}artial\textbf{ L}ayer \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{S}trategy. In particular, we divide the local model into a feature extractor and a classifier. In each iteration, the clients only upload the parameters of a feature extractor after local training. The server then aggregates these local parameters and returns the results to the clients.
  Each client retains its own classifier layer, ensuring that the backdoor labels do not impact other clients. We assess the effectiveness of FL-PLAS against state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on three image datasets and compare our approach to six defense strategies. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our methods can effectively protect local models from backdoor attacks. Without requiring any auxiliary dataset for the server, our method achieves a high main-task accuracy with a lower backdoor accuracy even under the condition of 90\% malicious users with the attacks of trigger, semantic and edge-case.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Emerging Phishing Threats: Assessing Quishing and LLM-generated Phishing Emails against Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern organizations are persistently targeted by phishing emails. Despite advances in detection systems and widespread employee training, attackers continue to innovate, posing ongoing threats. Two emerging vectors stand out in the current landscape: QR-code baits and LLM-enabled pretexting. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of current defenses against these attacks, particularly when it comes to real-world impact on employees. This gap leaves uncertainty around to what extent related countermeasures are justified or needed. Our work addresses this issue.
  We conduct three phishing simulations across organizations of varying sizes -- from small-medium businesses to a multinational enterprise. In total, we send over 71k emails targeting employees, including: a "traditional" phishing email with a click-through button; a nearly-identical "quishing" email with a QR code instead; and a phishing email written with the assistance of an LLM and open-source intelligence. Our results show that quishing emails have the same effectiveness as traditional phishing emails at luring users to the landing webpage -- which is worrying, given that quishing emails are much harder to identify even by operational detectors. We also find that LLMs can be very good "social engineers": in one company, over 30% of the emails opened led to visiting the landing webpage -- a rate exceeding some prior benchmarks. Finally, we complement our study by conducting a survey across the organizations' employees, measuring their "perceived" phishing awareness. Our findings suggest a correlation between higher self-reported awareness and organizational resilience to phishing attempts.</description>

      <title>MalVis: A Large-Scale Image-Based Framework and Dataset for Advancing Android Malware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As technology advances, Android malware continues to pose significant threats to devices and sensitive data. The open-source nature of the Android OS and the availability of its SDK contribute to this rapid growth. Traditional malware detection techniques, such as signature-based, static, and dynamic analysis, struggle to detect obfuscated threats that use encryption, packing, or compression. While deep learning (DL)-based visualization methods have been proposed, they often fail to highlight the critical malicious features effectively. This research introduces MalVis, a unified visualization framework that integrates entropy and N-gram analysis to emphasize structural and anomalous patterns in malware bytecode. MalVis addresses key limitations of prior methods, including insufficient feature representation, poor interpretability, and limited data accessibility. The framework leverages a newly introduced large-scale dataset, the MalVis dataset, containing over 1.3 million visual samples across nine malware classes and one benign class. We evaluate MalVis against state-of-the-art visualization techniques using leading CNN models: MobileNet-V2, DenseNet201, ResNet50, and Inception-V3. To enhance performance and reduce overfitting, we implement eight ensemble learning strategies. Additionally, an undersampling technique mitigates class imbalance in the multiclass setting. MalVis achieves strong results: 95.19% accuracy, 90.81% F1-score, 92.58% precision, 89.10% recall, 87.58% MCC, and 98.06% ROC-AUC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MalVis in enabling accurate, interpretable malware detection and providing a valuable resource for security research and applications.</description>

      <title>Back to Square Roots: An Optimal Bound on the Matrix Factorization Error for Multi-Epoch Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix factorization mechanisms for differentially private training have emerged as a promising approach to improve model utility under privacy constraints. In practical settings, models are typically trained over multiple epochs, requiring matrix factorizations that account for repeated participation. Existing theoretical upper and lower bounds on multi-epoch factorization error leave a significant gap. In this work, we introduce a new explicit factorization method, Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR), which imposes a banded structure on the inverse correlation matrix. This factorization enables us to derive an explicit and tight characterization of the multi-epoch error. We further prove that BISR achieves asymptotically optimal error by matching the upper and lower bounds. Empirically, BISR performs on par with state-of-the-art factorization methods, while being simpler to implement, computationally efficient, and easier to analyze.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Social-Capital: Privacy-Preserving Consensus Protocol Replacing Stake for Social Capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus protocols used today in blockchains often rely on computational power or financial stakes - scarce resources. We propose a novel protocol using social capital - trust and influence from social interactions - as a non-transferable staking mechanism to ensure fairness and decentralization. The methodology integrates zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable credentials, a Whisk-like leader election, and an incentive scheme to prevent Sybil attacks and encourage engagement. The theoretical framework would enhance privacy and equity, though unresolved issues like off-chain bribery require further research. This work offers a new model aligned with modern social media behavior and lifestyle, with applications in finance, providing a practical insight for decentralized system development.</description>

      <title>Nonmalleable Progress Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-flow control systems often enforce progress-insensitive noninterference, as it is simple to understand and enforce. Unfortunately, real programs need to declassify results and endorse inputs, which noninterference disallows, while preventing attackers from controlling leakage, including through progress channels, which progress-insensitivity ignores.
  This work combines ideas for progress-sensitive security with secure downgrading (declassification and endorsement) to identify a notion of securely downgrading progress information. We use hyperproperties to distill the separation between progress-sensitive and progress-insensitive noninterference and combine it with nonmalleable information flow, an existing (progress-insensitive) definition of secure downgrading, to define nonmalleable progress leakage (NMPL). We present the first information-flow type system to allow some progress leakage while enforcing NMPL, and we show how to infer the location of secure progress downgrades. All theorems are verified in Rocq.</description>

      <title>TPM2.0-Supported Runtime Customizable TEE on FPGA-SoC with User-Controllable vTPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Field Programmable Gate Array System on Chip (FPGA-SoC) in Cloud can effectively protect users' private intel-lectual Property (IP) cores. In order to facilitate the wide-spread deployment of FPGA-SoC TEE, this paper proposes an approach for constructing a TPM 2.0-compatible runtime customizable TEE on FPGA-SoC. This approach leverages a user-controllable virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) that integrates sensitive operations specific to FPGA-SoC TEE. It provides TPM 2.0 support for a customizable FPGA-SoC TEE to dynamically measure, deploy, and invoke IP during runtime. Our main contributions include: (i) Propose an FPGA-vTPM architecture that enables the TPM 2.0 specification support for FPGA-SoC TEE; (ii) Explore the utilization of FPGA-vTPM to dynamically measure, deploy, and invoke users' IPs on FPGA-SoC TEE; (iii) Extend the TPM command set to accommodate the sensitive operations of FPGA-SoC TEE, enabling users to perform sensitive tasks in a secure and verifiable manner according to the TPM 2.0 specification. We implement a prototype of TRCTEE on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform and conducted security analysis and performance evaluations to prove the practicality and enhanced security features of this approach.</description>

      <title>PoLO: Proof-of-Learning and Proof-of-Ownership at Once with Chained Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly shared and outsourced, raising requirements of verifying training effort (Proof-of-Learning, PoL) to ensure claimed performance and establishing ownership (Proof-of-Ownership, PoO) for transactions. When models are trained by untrusted parties, PoL and PoO must be enforced together to enable protection, attribution, and compensation. However, existing studies typically address them separately, which not only weakens protection against forgery and privacy breaches but also leads to high verification overhead.
  We propose PoLO, a unified framework that simultaneously achieves PoL and PoO using chained watermarks. PoLO splits the training process into fine-grained training shards and embeds a dedicated watermark in each shard. Each watermark is generated using the hash of the preceding shard, certifying the training process of the preceding shard. The chained structure makes it computationally difficult to forge any individual part of the whole training process. The complete set of watermarks serves as the PoL, while the final watermark provides the PoO. PoLO offers more efficient and privacy-preserving verification compared to the vanilla PoL solutions that rely on gradient-based trajectory tracing and inadvertently expose training data during verification, while maintaining the same level of ownership assurance of watermark-based PoO schemes. Our evaluation shows that PoLO achieves 99% watermark detection accuracy for ownership verification, while preserving data privacy and cutting verification costs to just 1.5-10% of traditional methods. Forging PoLO demands 1.1-4x more resources than honest proof generation, with the original proof retaining over 90% detection accuracy even after attacks.</description>

      <title>Automated Profile Inference with Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impressive progress has been made in automated problem-solving by the collaboration of large language models (LLMs) based agents. However, these automated capabilities also open avenues for malicious applications. In this paper, we study a new threat that LLMs pose to online pseudonymity, called automated profile inference, where an adversary can instruct LLMs to automatically scrape and extract sensitive personal attributes from publicly visible user activities on pseudonymous platforms. We also introduce an automated profiling framework called AutoProfiler to assess the feasibility of such threats in real-world scenarios. AutoProfiler consists of four specialized LLM agents, who work collaboratively to collect and process user online activities and generate a profile with extracted personal information. Experimental results on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that AutoProfiler is highly effective and efficient, and can be easily deployed on a web scale. We demonstrate that the inferred attributes are both sensitive and identifiable, posing significant risks of privacy breaches, such as de-anonymization and sensitive information leakage. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies from different perspectives and advocate for increased public awareness of this emerging privacy threat to online pseudonymity.</description>

      <title>IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</description>

      <title>SecEmb: Sparsity-Aware Secure Federated Learning of On-Device Recommender System with Large Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommender system (FedRec) has emerged as a solution to protect user data through collaborative training techniques. A typical FedRec involves transmitting the full model and entire weight updates between edge devices and the server, causing significant burdens to devices with limited bandwidth and computational power. While the sparsity of embedding updates provides opportunity for payload optimization, existing sparsity-aware federated protocols generally sacrifice privacy for efficiency. A key challenge in designing a secure sparsity-aware efficient protocol is to protect the rated item indices from the server. In this paper, we propose a lossless secure recommender systems on sparse embedding updates (SecEmb). SecEmb reduces user payload while ensuring that the server learns no information about both rated item indices and individual updates except the aggregated model. The protocol consists of two correlated modules: (1) a privacy-preserving embedding retrieval module that allows users to download relevant embeddings from the server, and (2) an update aggregation module that securely aggregates updates at the server. Empirical analysis demonstrates that SecEmb reduces both download and upload communication costs by up to 90x and decreases user-side computation time by up to 70x compared with secure FedRec protocols. Additionally, it offers non-negligible utility advantages compared with lossy message compression methods.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Improving Google A2A Protocol: Safeguarding Sensitive Data in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A2A, a protocol for AI agent communication, offers a robust foundation for secure AI agent communication. However, it has several critical issues in handling sensitive data, such as payment details, identification documents, and personal information. This paper reviews the existing protocol, identifies its limitations, and proposes specific enhancements to improve security, privacy, and trust. It includes a concrete example to illustrate the problem and solution, research-backed rationales, and implementation considerations, drawing on prior studies to strengthen the arguments and proposed solutions. This proposal includes seven enhancements: short-lived tokens, customer authentication (SCA), granular scopes, explicit consent, direct data transfer, multi-transaction approval, and payment standard compliance. The vacation booking example illustrates how these enhancements reduce risks and enhance user experience.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have been widely deployed in a wide range of applications in the real world, including healthcare diagnostics, financial analysis, customer support, robotics, and autonomous driving, expanding their powerful capability of understanding, reasoning, and generating natural languages. However, the wide deployment of LLM-based applications exposes critical security and reliability risks, such as the potential for malicious misuse, privacy leakage, and service disruption that weaken user trust and undermine societal safety. This paper provides a systematic overview of the details of adversarial attacks targeting both LLMs and LLM-based agents. These attacks are organized into three phases in LLMs: Training-Phase Attacks, Inference-Phase Attacks, and Availability &amp; Integrity Attacks. For each phase, we analyze the details of representative and recently introduced attack methods along with their corresponding defenses. We hope our survey will provide a good tutorial and a comprehensive understanding of LLM security, especially for attacks on LLMs. We desire to raise attention to the risks inherent in widely deployed LLM-based applications and highlight the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies for evolving threats.</description>

      <title>Compile-Time Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Eliminating Online Encryption via Algebraic Basis Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for compile-time ciphertext synthesis in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) systems. Instead of invoking encryption algorithms at runtime, our method synthesizes ciphertexts from precomputed encrypted basis vectors using only homomorphic additions, scalar multiplications, and randomized encryptions of zero. This decouples ciphertext generation from encryption, and enables efficient batch encoding through algebraic reuse. We formalize this technique as a randomized module morphism and prove that it satisfies IND-CPA security. Our proof uses a hybrid game framework that interpolates between encrypted vector instances and reduces adversarial advantage to the indistinguishability of the underlying FHE scheme. This reduction structure captures the security implications of ciphertext basis reuse and structured noise injection. The proposed synthesis primitive supports fast, encryption-free ingestion in outsourced database systems and other high-throughput FHE pipelines. It is compatible with standard FHE APIs and preserves layout semantics for downstream homomorphic operations.</description>

      <title>hChain: Blockchain Based Large Scale EHR Data Sharing with Enhanced Security and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.</description>

      <title>EPSpatial: Achieving Efficient and Private Statistical Analytics of Geospatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial data statistics involve the aggregation and analysis of location data to derive the distribution of clients within geospatial. The need for privacy protection in geospatial data analysis has become paramount due to concerns over the misuse or unauthorized access of client location information. However, existing private geospatial data statistics mainly rely on privacy computing techniques such as cryptographic tools and differential privacy, which leads to significant overhead and inaccurate results. In practical applications, geospatial data is frequently generated by mobile devices such as smartphones and IoT sensors. The continuous mobility of clients and the need for real-time updates introduce additional complexity. To address these issues, we first design \textit{spatially distributed point functions (SDPF)}, which combines a quad-tree structure with distributed point functions, allowing clients to succinctly secret-share values on the nodes of an exponentially large quad-tree. Then, we use Gray code to partition the region and combine SDPF with it to propose $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$, a scheme for accurate, efficient, and private statistical analytics of geospatial data. Moreover, considering clients' frequent movement requires continuous location updates, we leverage the region encoding property to present an efficient update algorithm.Security analysis shows that $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ effectively protects client location privacy. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that $\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ reduces computational and communication overhead by at least $50\%$ compared to existing statistical schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards Centralized Orchestration of Cyber Protection Condition (CPCON)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) Cyber Protection Condition (CPCON) framework mandates graduated security postures across Department of Defense (DoD) networks, but current implementation remains largely manual, inconsistent, and error-prone. This paper presents a prototype system for centralized orchestration of CPCON directives, enabling automated policy enforcement and real-time threat response across heterogeneous network environments. Building on prior work in host-based intrusion response, our system leverages a policy-driven orchestrator to standardize security actions, isolate compromised subnets, and verify enforcement status. We validate the system through emulated attack scenarios, demonstrating improved speed, accuracy, and verifiability in CPCON transitions with human-in-the-loop oversight.</description>

      <title>GDPRShield: AI-Powered GDPR Support for Software Developers in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in privacy violations in modern software development, regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have been established to enforce strict data protection practices. However, insufficient privacy awareness among SME software developers contributes to failure in GDPR compliance. For instance, a developer unfamiliar with data minimization may build a system that collects excessive data, violating GDPR and risking fines. One reason for this lack of awareness is that developers in SMEs often take on multidisciplinary roles (e.g., front-end, back-end, database management, and privacy compliance), which limits specialization in privacy. This lack of awareness may lead to poor privacy attitudes, ultimately hindering the development of a strong organizational privacy culture. However, SMEs that achieve GDPR compliance may gain competitive advantages, such as increased user trust and marketing value, compared to others that do not.
  Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel AI-powered framework called "GDPRShield," specifically designed to enhance the GDPR awareness of SME software developers and, through this, improve their privacy attitudes. Simultaneously, GDPRShield boosts developers' motivation to comply with GDPR from the early stages of software development. It leverages functional requirements written as user stories to provide comprehensive GDPR-based privacy descriptions tailored to each requirement. Alongside improving awareness, GDPRShield strengthens motivation by presenting real-world consequences of noncompliance, such as heavy fines, reputational damage, and loss of user trust, aligned with each requirement. This dual focus on awareness and motivation leads developers to engage with GDPRShield, improving their GDPR compliance and privacy attitudes, which will help SMEs build a stronger privacy culture over time.</description>

      <title>Web IP at Risk: Prevent Unauthorized Real-Time Retrieval by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with online retrieval capabilities presents a double-edged sword that enables convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources, significantly reducing the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and leading to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response, we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction by leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs, outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.</description>

      <title>Shielding Latent Face Representations From Privacy Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's data-driven analytics landscape, deep learning has become a powerful tool, with latent representations, known as embeddings, playing a central role in several applications. In the face analytics domain, such embeddings are commonly used for biometric recognition (e.g., face identification). However, these embeddings, or templates, can inadvertently expose sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Leaking such information can compromise personal privacy and affect civil liberty and human rights. To address these concerns, we introduce a multi-layer protection framework for embeddings. It consists of a sequence of operations: (a) encrypting embeddings using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and (b) hashing them using irreversible feature manifold hashing. Unlike conventional encryption methods, FHE enables computations directly on encrypted data, allowing downstream analytics while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. To reduce the overhead of encrypted processing, we employ embedding compression. Our proposed method shields latent representations of sensitive data from leaking private attributes (such as age and gender) while retaining essential functional capabilities (such as face identification). Extensive experiments on two datasets using two face encoders demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art privacy protection methods.</description>

      <title>An Automated Blackbox Noncompliance Checker for QUIC Server Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop QUICtester, an automated approach for uncovering non-compliant behaviors in the ratified QUIC protocol implementations (RFC 9000/9001). QUICtester leverages active automata learning to abstract the behavior of a QUIC implementation into a finite state machine (FSM) representation. Unlike prior noncompliance checking methods, to help uncover state dependencies on event timing, QUICtester introduces the idea of state learning with event timing variations, adopting both valid and invalid input configurations, and combinations of security and transport layer parameters during learning. We use pairwise differential analysis of learned behaviour models of tested QUIC implementations to identify non-compliance instances as behaviour deviations in a property-agnostic way. This exploits the existence of the many different QUIC implementations, removing the need for validated, formal models. The diverse implementations act as cross-checking test oracles to discover non-compliance. We used QUICtester to analyze analyze 186 learned models from 19 QUIC implementations under the five security settings and discovered 55 implementation errors. Significantly, the tool uncovered a QUIC specification ambiguity resulting in an easily exploitable DoS vulnerability, led to 5 CVE assignments from developers, and two bug bounties thus far.</description>

      <title>Malware families discovery via Open-Set Recognition on Android manifest permissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware are malicious programs that are grouped into families based on their penetration technique, source code, and other characteristics. Classifying malware programs into their respective families is essential for building effective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge potential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be recognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest files. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the high-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of training samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families makes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the malware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that, on top of classifying known malware, detects new ones. In particular, we combine an open-set recognition technique developed within the computer vision community, namely MaxLogit, with a tree-based Gradient Boosting classifier, which is particularly effective in classifying high-dimensional data. Our solution turns out to be very practical, as it can be seamlessly employed in a standard classification workflow, and efficient, as it adds minimal computational overhead. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets demonstrate the potential of our solution, which has been deployed in a business environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access-control misconfigurations are among the main causes of today's data breaches in web applications. However, few techniques are available to support automatic and systematic testing for access-control changes and detecting risky changes to prevent severe consequences. As a result, those critical security configurations often lack testing, or are tested manually in an ad hoc way.
  This paper advocates that tests should be made available for users to test access-control configuration changes. The key challenges are such tests need to be run with production environments (to reason end-to-end behavior) and need to be performance-efficient. We present a new approach to create such tests, as a mini test environment incorporating production program and data, called ACtests. ACtests report the impacts of access-control changes, namely the requests that were denied but would be allowed after a change, and vice versa. Users can validate if the changed requests are intended or not and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
  We evaluate ACtests with 193 public configurations of widely-used web applications on Dockerhub. ACtests detect 168 new vulnerabilities from 72 configuration images. We report them to the image maintainers: 54 of them have been confirmed and 44 have been fixed. We also conduct in-depth experiments with five real-world deployed systems, including Wikipedia and a commercial company's web proxy. Our results show that ACtests effectively and efficiently detect all the change impacts.</description>

      <title>FLTG: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning via Angle-Based Defense and Non-IID-Aware Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byzantine attacks during model aggregation in Federated Learning (FL) threaten training integrity by manipulating malicious clients' updates. Existing methods struggle with limited robustness under high malicious client ratios and sensitivity to non-i.i.d. data, leading to degraded accuracy. To address this, we propose FLTG, a novel aggregation algorithm integrating angle-based defense and dynamic reference selection. FLTG first filters clients via ReLU-clipped cosine similarity, leveraging a server-side clean dataset to exclude misaligned updates. It then dynamically selects a reference client based on the prior global model to mitigate non-i.i.d. bias, assigns aggregation weights inversely proportional to angular deviations, and normalizes update magnitudes to suppress malicious scaling. Evaluations across datasets of varying complexity under five classic attacks demonstrate FLTG's superiority over state-of-the-art methods under extreme bias scenarios and sustains robustness with a higher proportion(over 50%) of malicious clients.</description>

      <title>Outsourced Privacy-Preserving Feature Selection Based on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is a technique that extracts a meaningful subset from a set of features in training data. When the training data is large-scale, appropriate feature selection enables the removal of redundant features, which can improve generalization performance, accelerate the training process, and enhance the interpretability of the model. This study proposes a privacy-preserving computation model for feature selection. Generally, when the data owner and analyst are the same, there is no need to conceal the private information. However, when they are different parties or when multiple owners exist, an appropriate privacy-preserving framework is required. Although various private feature selection algorithms, they all require two or more computing parties and do not guarantee security in environments where no external party can be fully trusted. To address this issue, we propose the first outsourcing algorithm for feature selection using fully homomorphic encryption. Compared to a prior two-party algorithm, our result improves the time and space complexity O(kn^2) to O(kn log^3 n) and O(kn), where k and n denote the number of features and data samples, respectively. We also implemented the proposed algorithm and conducted comparative experiments with the naive one. The experimental result shows the efficiency of our method even with small datasets.</description>

      <title>Lara: Lightweight Anonymous Authentication with Asynchronous Revocation Auditability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymous authentication is a technique that allows to combine access control with privacy preservation. Typically, clients use different pseudonyms for each access, hindering providers from correlating their activities. To perform the revocation of pseudonyms in a privacy preserving manner is notoriously challenging. When multiple pseudonyms are revoked together, an adversary may infer that these pseudonyms belong to the same client and perform privacy breaking correlations, in particular if these pseudonyms have already been used. Backward unlinkability and revocation auditability are two properties that address this problem. Most systems that offer these properties rely on some sort of time slots, which assume a common reference of time that must be shared among clients and providers; for instance, the client must be aware that it should not use a pseudonym after a certain time or should be able to assess the freshness of a revocation list prior to perform authentication. In this paper we propose Lara, a Lightweight Anonymous Authentication with Asynchronous Revocation Auditability that does not require parties to agree on the current time slot and it is not affected by the clock skew. Prior to disclosing a pseudonym, clients are provided with a revocation list (RL) and can check that the pseudonym has not been revoked. Then, they provide a proof on non-revocation that cannot be used against any other (past or future) RL, avoiding any dependency of timing assumptions. Lara can be implemented using efficient public-key primitives and space-efficient data structures. We have implemented a prototype of Lara and have assessed experimentally its efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Assistants to Adversaries: Exploring the Security Risks of Mobile LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.</description>

      <title>ACE: Confidential Computing for Embedded RISC-V Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidential computing plays an important role in isolating sensitive applications from the vast amount of untrusted code commonly found in the modern cloud. We argue that it can also be leveraged to build safer and more secure mission-critical embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce the Assured Confidential Execution (ACE), an open-source and royalty-free confidential computing technology targeted for embedded RISC-V systems. We present a set of principles and a methodology that we used to build \ACE and that might be applied for developing other embedded systems that require formal verification. An evaluation of our prototype on the first available RISC-V hardware supporting virtualization indicates that ACE is a viable candidate for our target systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluatiing the efficacy of LLM Safety Solutions : The Palit Benchmark Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Dangers of Browsing AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept exploit.</description>

      <title>Network-wide Quantum Key Distribution with Onion Routing Relay (Conference Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic methods, necessitating the development of secure quantum key distribution (QKD) solutions for QKD Networks (QKDN). In this paper, a novel key distribution protocol, Onion Routing Relay (ORR), that integrates onion routing (OR) with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in a key-relay (KR) model is evaluated for QKDNs. This approach increases the security by enhancing confidentiality, integrity, authenticity (CIA principles), and anonymity in quantum-secure communications. By employing PQC-based encapsulation, ORR aims to avoid the security risks posed by intermediate malicious nodes and ensures end-to-end security. Our results show a competitive performance of the basic ORR model, against current KR and trusted-node (TN) approaches, demonstrating its feasibility and applicability in high-security environments maintaining a consistent Quality of Service (QoS). The results also show that while basic ORR incurs higher encryption overhead, it provides substantial security improvements without significantly impacting the overall key distribution time. Nevertheless, the introduction of an end-to-end authentication extension (ORR-Ext) has a significant impact on the Quality of Service (QoS), thereby limiting its suitability to applications with stringent security requirements.</description>

      <title>Cross-Cloud Data Privacy Protection: Optimizing Collaborative Mechanisms of AI Systems by Integrating Federated Learning and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments. However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and data privacy protection.</description>

      <title>SVAFD: A Secure and Verifiable Co-Aggregation Protocol for Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure Aggregation (SA) is an indispensable component of Federated Learning (FL) that concentrates on privacy preservation while allowing for robust aggregation. However, most SA designs rely heavily on the unrealistic assumption of homogeneous model architectures. Federated Distillation (FD), which aggregates locally computed logits instead of model parameters, introduces a promising alternative for cooperative training in heterogeneous model settings. Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing SA for FD. (i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely responsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing. Such central authority facilitates server to forge aggregation proofs or collude to bypass the claimed security guarantees; (ii) Existing SA, tailored for FL models, overlook the intrinsic properties of logits, making them unsuitable for FD.
  To address these challenges, we propose SVAFD, the first SA protocol that is specifically designed for FD. At a high level, SVAFD incorporates two innovations: (i) a multilateral co-aggregation method tha redefines the responsibilities of clients and server. Clients autonomously evaluate and aggregate logits shares locally with a lightweight coding scheme, while the server handles ciphertext decoding and performs the task of generating verification proofs; (ii) a quality-aware knowledge filtration method that facilitates biased logits exclusion against poisoning attacks. Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and colluding clients, making it well-suited for dynamic networks in real-world applications. We have implemented the SVAFD prototype over four emerging FD architectures and evaluated it against poisoning and inference attacks. Results demonstrate that SVAFD improves model accuracy, making it a significant step forward in secure and verifiable aggregation for heterogeneous FL systems.</description>

      <title>DynaNoise: Dynamic Probabilistic Noise Injection for Defending Against Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) pose a significant risk to the privacy of training datasets by exploiting subtle differences in model outputs to determine whether a particular data sample was used during training. These attacks can compromise sensitive information, especially in domains such as healthcare and finance, where data privacy is paramount. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as static differential privacy, rely on injecting a fixed amount of noise during training or inference. However, this approach often leads to a detrimental trade-off: the noise may be insufficient to counter sophisticated attacks or, when increased, may substantially degrade model performance. In this paper, we present DynaNoise, an adaptive approach that dynamically modulates noise injection based on query sensitivity. Our approach performs sensitivity analysis using measures such as Shannon entropy to evaluate the risk associated with each query and adjusts the noise variance accordingly. A probabilistic smoothing step is then applied to renormalize the perturbed outputs, ensuring that the model maintains high accuracy while effectively obfuscating membership signals. We further propose an empirical metric, the Membership Inference Defense Privacy-Utility Tradeoff (MIDPUT), which quantifies the balance between reducing attack success rates and preserving the target model's accuracy. Our extensive evaluation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates that DynaNoise not only significantly reduces MIA success rates but also achieves up to a fourfold improvement in the MIDPUT metric compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, DynaNoise maintains competitive model accuracy while imposing only marginal inference overhead, highlighting its potential as an effective and efficient privacy defense against MIAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) increasingly rely on deep learning-based perception models, which remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit adversarial attacks and defense methods, focusing on road sign recognition and lead object detection and prediction (e.g., relative distance). Using a Level-2 production ADS, OpenPilot by Comma.ai, and the widely adopted YOLO model, we systematically examine the impact of adversarial perturbations and assess defense techniques, including adversarial training, image processing, contrastive learning, and diffusion models. Our experiments highlight both the strengths and limitations of these methods in mitigating complex attacks. Through targeted evaluations of model robustness, we aim to provide deeper insights into the vulnerabilities of ADS perception systems and contribute guidance for developing more resilient defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Probing the Vulnerability of Large Language Models to Polysemantic Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token, and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.</description>

      <title>Diverging Towards Hallucination: Detection of Failures in Vision-Language Models via Multi-token Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (SLP) and P(True), typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its highest scoring component overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and tractable. On MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE improves AUROC by 9.4 +/- 1.3 points over SLP and by 12.1 +/- 1.7 points over P(True), setting a new state-of-the-art in hallucination detection for open-source VLMs.</description>

      <title>JULI: Jailbreak Large Language Models by Self-Introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>On Membership Inference Attacks in Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and efficient student models. Our implementation source code is available at https://github.com/richardcui18/MIA_in_KD.</description>

      <title>AES-RV: Hardware-Efficient RISC-V Accelerator with Low-Latency AES Instruction Extension for IoT Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely adopted cryptographic algorithm essential for securing embedded systems and IoT platforms. However, existing AES hardware accelerators often face limitations in performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. This paper presents AES-RV, a hardware-efficient RISC-V accelerator featuring low-latency AES instruction extensions optimized for real-time processing across all AES modes and key sizes. AES-RV integrates three key innovations: high-bandwidth internal buffers for continuous data processing, a specialized AES unit with custom low-latency instructions, and a pipelined system supported by a ping-pong memory transfer mechanism. Implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102 SoC FPGA, AES-RV achieves up to 255.97 times speedup and up to 453.04 times higher energy efficiency compared to baseline and conventional CPU/GPU platforms. It also demonstrates superior throughput and area efficiency against state-of-the-art AES accelerators, making it a strong candidate for secure and high-performance embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Facial Recognition Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face recognition performance based on deep learning heavily relies on large-scale training data, which is often difficult to acquire in practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a GAN-based data augmentation method with three key contributions: (1) a residual-embedded generator to alleviate gradient vanishing/exploding problems, (2) an Inception ResNet-V1 based FaceNet discriminator for improved adversarial training, and (3) an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes data generation and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves stable training dynamics and significantly improves face recognition accuracy by 12.7% on the LFW benchmark compared to baseline methods, while maintaining good generalization capability with limited training samples.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementations of Residue Generators Mod 2n + 1 Providing Diminished-1 Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli of the form 2n + 1 belong to a class of low-cost odd moduli, which have been frequently selected to form the basis of various residue number systems (RNS). The most efficient computations modulo (mod) 2n + 1 are performed using the so-called diminished-1 (D1) representation. Therefore, it is desirable that the input converter from the positional number system to RNS (composed of a set of residue generators) could generate the residues mod 2n + 1 in D1 form. In this paper, we propose the basic architecture of the residue generator mod 2n + 1 with D1 output. It is universal, because its initial part can be easily designed for an arbitrary p &gt;= 4n, whereas its final block-the 4-operand adder mod 2n + 1-preserves the same structure for any p. If a pair of conjugate moduli 2n +/- 1 belongs to the RNS moduli set, the latter architecture can be easily extended to build p-input bi-residue generators mod 2n+/-1, which not only save hardware by sharing p - 4n full-adders, but also generate the residue mod 2n + 1 directly in D1 form.</description>

      <title>Safe Delta: Consistently Preserving Safety when Fine-Tuning LLMs on Diverse Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign, can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets (e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.</description>

      <title>FABLE: A Localized, Targeted Adversarial Attack on Weather Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based weather forecasting models have recently demonstrated significant performance improvements over gold-standard physics-based simulation tools. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we first investigate the feasibility of applying existing adversarial attack methods to weather forecasting models. We argue that a successful attack should (1) not modify significantly its original inputs, (2) be faithful, i.e., achieve the desired forecast at targeted locations with minimal changes to non-targeted locations, and (3) be geospatio-temporally realistic. However, balancing these criteria is a challenge as existing methods are not designed to preserve the geospatio-temporal dependencies of the original samples. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called FABLE (Forecast Alteration By Localized targeted advErsarial attack), which employs a 3D discrete wavelet decomposition to extract the varying components of the geospatio-temporal data. By regulating the magnitude of adversarial perturbations across different components, FABLE can generate adversarial inputs that maintain geospatio-temporal coherence while remaining faithful and closely aligned with the original inputs. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over baseline methods across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Self-Destructive Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attacks pose a major threat to the security of large language models (LLMs), allowing adversaries to compromise safety guardrails with minimal harmful data. While existing defenses attempt to reinforce LLM alignment, they fail to address models' inherent "trainability" on harmful data, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attacks with increased learning rates or larger harmful datasets. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce SEAM, a novel alignment-enhancing defense that transforms LLMs into self-destructive models with intrinsic resilience to misalignment attempts. Specifically, these models retain their capabilities for legitimate tasks while exhibiting substantial performance degradation when fine-tuned on harmful data. The protection is achieved through a novel loss function that couples the optimization trajectories of benign and harmful data, enhanced with adversarial gradient ascent to amplify the self-destructive effect. To enable practical training, we develop an efficient Hessian-free gradient estimate with theoretical error bounds. Extensive evaluation across LLMs and datasets demonstrates that SEAM creates a no-win situation for adversaries: the self-destructive models achieve state-of-the-art robustness against low-intensity attacks and undergo catastrophic performance collapse under high-intensity attacks, rendering them effectively unusable. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)</description>

      <title>ACU: Analytic Continual Unlearning for Efficient and Exact Forgetting with Privacy Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning (CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.</description>

      <title>Is Artificial Intelligence Generated Image Detection a Solved Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.</description>

      <title>Protocol as Poetry: Case Study on Pak's Protocol Arts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts and a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and algorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably Primavera De Filippi's "protocolism"-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre from other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap, this paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak, an early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart contracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic mechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective absence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By developing a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for artists shaping this evolving art form.</description>

      <title>Private Statistical Estimation via Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for differentially private (DP) statistical estimation via data truncation, addressing a key challenge in DP estimation when the data support is unbounded. Traditional approaches rely on problem-specific sensitivity analysis, limiting their applicability. By leveraging techniques from truncated statistics, we develop computationally efficient DP estimators for exponential family distributions, including Gaussian mean and covariance estimation, achieving near-optimal sample complexity. Previous works on exponential families only consider bounded or one-dimensional families. Our approach mitigates sensitivity through truncation while carefully correcting for the introduced bias using maximum likelihood estimation and DP stochastic gradient descent. Along the way, we establish improved uniform convergence guarantees for the log-likelihood function of exponential families, which may be of independent interest. Our results provide a general blueprint for DP algorithm design via truncated statistics.</description>

Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM) optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1 achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1 refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in language model deployment.</description>

      <title>Does Low Rank Adaptation Lead to Lower Robustness against Training-Time Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness.
  We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</description>

      <title>Prink: $k_s$-Anonymization for Streaming Data in Apache Flink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Prink, a novel and practically applicable concept and fully implemented prototype for ks-anonymizing data streams in real-world application architectures. Building upon the pre-existing, yet rudimentary CASTLE scheme, Prink for the first time introduces semantics-aware ks-anonymization of non-numerical (such as categorical or hierarchically generalizable) streaming data in a information loss-optimized manner. In addition, it provides native integration into Apache Flink, one of the prevailing frameworks for enterprise-grade stream data processing in numerous application domains.
  Our contributions excel the previously established state of the art for the privacy guarantee-providing anonymization of streaming data in that they 1) allow to include non-numerical data in the anonymization process, 2) provide discrete datapoints instead of aggregates, thereby facilitating flexible data use, 3) are applicable in real-world system contexts with minimal integration efforts, and 4) are experimentally proven to raise acceptable performance overheads and information loss in realistic settings. With these characteristics, Prink provides an anonymization approach which is practically feasible for a broad variety of real-world, enterprise-grade stream processing applications and environments.</description>

      <title>FlowPure: Continuous Normalizing Flows for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this, state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats, while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.</description>

      <title>Recommender Systems for Democracy: Toward Adversarial Robustness in Voting Advice Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs) help millions of voters understand which political parties or candidates best align with their views. This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.</description>

      <title>DICTION:DynamIC robusT whIte bOx watermarkiNg scheme for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) watermarking is a suitable method for protecting the ownership of deep learning (DL) models. It secretly embeds an identifier (watermark) within the model, which can be retrieved by the owner to prove ownership. In this paper, we first provide a unified framework for white box DNN watermarking schemes. It includes current state-of-the-art methods outlining their theoretical inter-connections. Next, we introduce DICTION, a new white-box Dynamic Robust watermarking scheme, we derived from this framework. Its main originality stands on a generative adversarial network (GAN) strategy where the watermark extraction function is a DNN trained as a GAN discriminator taking the target model to watermark as a GAN generator with a latent space as the input of the GAN trigger set. DICTION can be seen as a generalization of DeepSigns which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only other Dynamic white-box watermarking scheme from the literature. Experiments conducted on the same model test set as Deepsigns demonstrate that our scheme achieves much better performance. Especially, with DICTION, one can increase the watermark capacity while preserving the target model accuracy at best and simultaneously ensuring strong watermark robustness against a wide range of watermark removal and detection attacks.</description>

      <title>Kick Bad Guys Out! Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as model poisoning and backdoor attacks. However, existing defense mechanisms often fall short in real-world settings due to key limitations: they may rely on impractical assumptions, introduce distortions by modifying aggregation functions, or degrade model performance even in benign scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel anomaly detection method designed specifically for practical FL scenarios. Our approach employs a two-stage, conditionally activated detection mechanism: cross-round check first detects whether suspicious activity has occurred, and, if warranted, a cross-client check filters out malicious participants. This mechanism preserves utility while avoiding unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, to ensure the transparency and integrity of the defense mechanism, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs, enabling clients to verify the detection without relying solely on the server's goodwill. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in FL security and the demands of real-world deployment. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and real-world edge devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>LLMPot: Dynamically Configured LLM-based Honeypot for Industrial Protocol and Physical Process Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are extensively used in critical infrastructures ensuring efficient, reliable, and continuous operations. However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models enables the creation of realistic machine-generated content. Watermarking is a promising approach to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, embedding statistical signals in the output that are ideally undetectable to humans. We propose a watermarking framework that encodes such signals through an error correcting code. Our method, termed robust binary code (RBC) watermark, introduces no noticeable degradation in quality. We evaluate our watermark on base and instruction fine-tuned models and find our watermark is robust to edits, deletions, and translations. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on watermarking, a powerful statistical test for detection and for generating $p$-values, and theoretical guarantees. Our empirical findings suggest our watermark is fast, powerful, and robust, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Unsupervised Online IDS for Masquerade Attacks in CAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular controller area networks (CANs) are susceptible to masquerade attacks by malicious adversaries. In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by introducing a benchmark study of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing benchmarks in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although benchmarked IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the benchmarked methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</description>

      <title>Defending Code Language Models against Backdoor Attacks with Deceptive Cross-Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code Language Models (CLMs), particularly those leveraging deep learning, have achieved significant success in code intelligence domain. However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of "early learning" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>"Yes, My LoRD." Guiding Language Model Extraction with Locality Reinforced Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing attention in recent research. However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method in extracting various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/liangzid/LoRD-MEA .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our research, we introduce a new concept called "LLM Augmented Pentesting" demonstrated with a tool named "Pentest Copilot," that revolutionizes the field of ethical hacking by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into penetration testing workflows, leveraging the advanced GPT-4-turbo model. Our approach focuses on overcoming the traditional resistance to automation in penetration testing by employing LLMs to automate specific sub-tasks while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the overall testing process.
  Pentest Copilot showcases remarkable proficiency in tasks such as utilizing testing tools, interpreting outputs, and suggesting follow-up actions, efficiently bridging the gap between automated systems and human expertise. By integrating a "chain of thought" mechanism, Pentest Copilot optimizes token usage and enhances decision-making processes, leading to more accurate and context-aware outputs. Additionally, our implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) minimizes hallucinations and ensures the tool remains aligned with the latest cybersecurity techniques and knowledge. We also highlight a unique infrastructure system that supports in-browser penetration testing, providing a robust platform for cybersecurity professionals. Our findings demonstrate that LLM Augmented Pentesting can not only significantly enhance task completion rates in penetration testing but also effectively addresses real-world challenges, marking a substantial advancement in the cybersecurity domain.</description>

      <title>Cross-Chain Options: A Bridgeless, Universal, and Efficient Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Options are fundamental to blockchain-based financial services, offering essential tools for risk management and price speculation, which enhance liquidity, flexibility, and market efficiency in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the growing interest in options for blockchain-resident assets, such as cryptocurrencies, current option mechanisms face significant challenges, including a high reliance on trusted third parties, limited asset support, high trading delays, and the requirement for option holders to provide upfront collateral.
  In this paper, we present a protocol that addresses the aforementioned issues. Our protocol is the first to eliminate the need for holders to post collateral when establishing options in trustless service environments (i.e. without a cross-chain bridge), which is achieved by introducing a guarantee from the option writer. Its universality allows for cross-chain options involving nearly \textit{any} assets on \textit{any} two different blockchains, provided the chains' programming languages can enforce and execute the necessary contract logic. Another key innovation is reducing option position transfer latency, which uses Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures (DAPS). Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme reduces option transfer latency to less than half of that in existing methods. Rigorous security analysis proves that our protocol achieves secure option trading, even when facing adversarial behaviors.</description>

      <title>VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety</title>

Abstract: Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with image text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety Information Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs according to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety evaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between textual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this end, we construct multimodal Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k image-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o. Besides, we empirically compare textual and multimodal alignment methods on VLSBench and find that textual alignment is effective enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is preferable for safety scenarios without VSIL. Code and data are released under https://github.com/AI45Lab/VLSBench</description>

      <title>`Do as I say not as I do': A Semi-Automated Approach for Jailbreak Prompt Attack against Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various domains due to their growing ability to process diverse types of input data, including text, audio, image and video. While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. Further, to better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flanking Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios.</description>

      <title>XOXO: Stealthy Cross-Origin Context Poisoning Attacks against AI Coding Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</description>

      <title>WMCopier: Forging Invisible Image Watermarks on Arbitrary Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invisible Image Watermarking is crucial for ensuring content provenance and accountability in generative AI. While Gen-AI providers are increasingly integrating invisible watermarking systems, the robustness of these schemes against forgery attacks remains poorly characterized. This is critical, as forging traceable watermarks onto illicit content leads to false attribution, potentially harming the reputation and legal standing of Gen-AI service providers who are not responsible for the content. In this work, we propose WMCopier, an effective watermark forgery attack that operates without requiring any prior knowledge of or access to the target watermarking algorithm. Our approach first models the target watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model, and then seamlessly embeds the target watermark into a non-watermarked image via a shallow inversion process. We also incorporate an iterative optimization procedure that refines the reconstructed image to further trade off the fidelity and forgery efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that WMCopier effectively deceives both open-source and closed-source watermark systems (e.g., Amazon's system), achieving a significantly higher success rate than existing methods. Additionally, we evaluate the robustness of forged samples and discuss the potential defenses against our attack.</description>

      <title>MCP Guardian: A Security-First Layer for Safeguarding MCP-Based AI System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Agentic AI gain mainstream adoption, the industry invests heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid leaps in reasoning and quality. However, these systems remain largely confined to data silos, and each new integration requires custom logic that is difficult to scale. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this challenge by defining a universal, open standard for securely connecting AI-based applications (MCP clients) to data sources (MCP servers). However, the flexibility of the MCP introduces new risks, including malicious tool servers and compromised data integrity. We present MCP Guardian, a framework that strengthens MCP-based communication with authentication, rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) scanning. Through real-world scenarios and empirical testing, we demonstrate how MCP Guardian effectively mitigates attacks and ensures robust oversight with minimal overheads. Our approach fosters secure, scalable data access for AI assistants, underscoring the importance of a defense-in-depth approach that enables safer and more transparent innovation in AI-driven environments.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</description>

      <title>WASP: Benchmarking Web Agent Security Against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous UI agents powered by AI have tremendous potential to boost human productivity by automating routine tasks such as filing taxes and paying bills. However, a major challenge in unlocking their full potential is security, which is exacerbated by the agent's ability to take action on their user's behalf. Existing tests for prompt injections in web agents either over-simplify the threat by testing unrealistic scenarios or giving the attacker too much power, or look at single-step isolated tasks. To more accurately measure progress for secure web agents, we introduce WASP -- a new publicly available benchmark for end-to-end evaluation of Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks. Evaluating with WASP shows that even top-tier AI models, including those with advanced reasoning capabilities, can be deceived by simple, low-effort human-written injections in very realistic scenarios. Our end-to-end evaluation reveals a previously unobserved insight: while attacks partially succeed in up to 86% of the case, even state-of-the-art agents often struggle to fully complete the attacker goals -- highlighting the current state of security by incompetence.</description>

      <title>SynFuzz: Leveraging Fuzzing of Netlist to Detect Synthesis Bugs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit (IC) design, the increasing complexity of modern processors and intellectual property (IP) cores has introduced new challenges in ensuring design correctness and security. The recent advancements in hardware fuzzing techniques have shown their efficacy in detecting hardware bugs and vulnerabilities at the RTL abstraction level of hardware. However, they suffer from several limitations, including an inability to address vulnerabilities introduced during synthesis and gate-level transformations. These methods often fail to detect issues arising from library adversaries, where compromised or malicious library components can introduce backdoors or unintended behaviors into the design. In this paper, we present a novel hardware fuzzer, SynFuzz, designed to overcome the limitations of existing hardware fuzzing frameworks. SynFuzz focuses on fuzzing hardware at the gate-level netlist to identify synthesis bugs and vulnerabilities that arise during the transition from RTL to the gate-level. We analyze the intrinsic hardware behaviors using coverage metrics specifically tailored for the gate-level. Furthermore, SynFuzz implements differential fuzzing to uncover bugs associated with EDA libraries. We evaluated SynFuzz on popular open-source processors and IP designs, successfully identifying 7 new synthesis bugs. Additionally, by exploiting the optimization settings of EDA tools, we performed a compromised library mapping attack (CLiMA), creating a malicious version of hardware designs that remains undetectable by traditional verification methods. We also demonstrate how SynFuzz overcomes the limitations of the industry-standard formal verification tool, Cadence Conformal, providing a more robust and comprehensive approach to hardware verification.</description>

      <title>What's Pulling the Strings? Evaluating Integrity and Attribution in AI Training and Inference through Concept Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.</description>

      <title>An In-kernel Forensics Engine for Investigating Evasive Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the years, adversarial attempts against critical services have become more effective and sophisticated in launching low-profile attacks. This trend has always been concerning. However, an even more alarming trend is the increasing difficulty of collecting relevant evidence about these attacks and the involved threat actors in the early stages before significant damage is done. This issue puts defenders at a significant disadvantage, as it becomes exceedingly difficult to understand the attack details and formulate an appropriate response. Developing robust forensics tools to collect evidence about modern threats has never been easy. One main challenge is to provide a robust trade-off between achieving sufficient visibility while leaving minimal detectable artifacts. This paper will introduce LASE, an open-source Low-Artifact Forensics Engine to perform threat analysis and forensics in Windows operating system. LASE augments current analysis tools by providing detailed, system-wide monitoring capabilities while minimizing detectable artifacts. We designed multiple deployment scenarios, showing LASE's potential in evidence gathering and threat reasoning in a real-world setting. By making LASE and its execution trace data available to the broader research community, this work encourages further exploration in the field by reducing the engineering costs for threat analysis and building a longitudinal behavioral analysis catalog for diverse security domains.</description>

      <title>"Explain, Don't Just Warn!" -- A Real-Time Framework for Generating Phishing Warnings with Contextual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-phishing tools typically display generic warnings that offer users limited explanation on why a website is considered malicious, which can prevent end-users from developing the mental models needed to recognize phishing cues on their own. This becomes especially problematic when these tools inevitably fail - particularly against evasive threats, and users are found to be ill-equipped to identify and avoid them independently. To address these limitations, we present PhishXplain (PXP), a real-time explainable phishing warning system designed to augment existing detection mechanisms. PXP empowers users by clearly articulating why a site is flagged as malicious, highlighting suspicious elements using a memory-efficient implementation of LLaMA 3.2. It utilizes a structured two-step prompt architecture to identify phishing features, generate contextual explanations, and render annotated screenshots that visually reinforce the warning. Longitudinally implementing PhishXplain over a month on 7,091 live phishing websites, we found that it can generate warnings for 94% of the sites, with a correctness of 96%. We also evaluated PhishXplain through a user study with 150 participants split into two groups: one received conventional, generic warnings, while the other interacted with PXP's explainable alerts. Participants who received the explainable warnings not only demonstrated a significantly better understanding of phishing indicators but also achieved higher accuracy in identifying phishing threats, even without any warning. Moreover, they reported greater satisfaction and trust in the warnings themselves. These improvements were especially pronounced among users with lower initial levels of cybersecurity proficiency and awareness. To encourage the adoption of this framework, we release PhishXplain as a browser extension.</description>

      <title>DeFeed: Secure Decentralized Cross-Contract Data Feed in Web 3.0 for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>

Abstract: Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs. Our solution represents a critical step towards seamless, decentralized communication in Web 3.0 ecosystems.</description>

Abstract: Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) has emerged as a robust framework for mitigating RowHammer (RH) vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems. However, we uncover a critical vulnerability: a timing channel introduced by the Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol and Refresh Management (RFM) commands. We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies.
  To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 1: Images</title>

Abstract: Generating differentially private (DP) synthetic data that closely resembles the original private data is a scalable way to mitigate privacy concerns in the current data-driven world. In contrast to current practices that train customized models for this task, we aim to generate DP Synthetic Data via APIs (DPSDA), where we treat foundation models as blackboxes and only utilize their inference APIs. Such API-based, training-free approaches are easier to deploy as exemplified by the recent surge in the number of API-based apps. These approaches can also leverage the power of large foundation models which are only accessible via their inference APIs. However, this comes with greater challenges due to strictly more restrictive model access and the need to protect privacy from the API provider.
  In this paper, we present a new framework called Private Evolution (PE) to solve this problem and show its initial promise on synthetic images. Surprisingly, PE can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods without any model training. For example, on CIFAR10 (with ImageNet as the public data), we achieve FID &lt;= 7.9 with privacy cost {\epsilon} = 0.67, significantly improving the previous SOTA from {\epsilon} = 32. We further demonstrate the promise of applying PE on large foundation models such as Stable Diffusion to tackle challenging private datasets with a small number of high-resolution images. The code and data are released at https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</description>

      <title>Securing Visually-Aware Recommender Systems: An Adversarial Image Reconstruction and Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With rich visual data, such as images, becoming readily associated with items, visually-aware recommendation systems (VARS) have been widely used in different applications. Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hot PATE: Private Aggregation of Distributions for Diverse Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework enables privacy-preserving machine learning by aggregating responses from disjoint subsets of sensitive data. Adaptations of PATE to tasks with inherent output diversity such as text generation face a core tension: preserving output diversity reduces teacher agreement, which in turn increases the noise required for differential privacy, degrading utility. Yet suppressing diversity is counterproductive, as modern large language models encapsulate knowledge in their output distributions.
  We propose Hot PATE, a variant tailored to settings where outputs are distributions. We formally define what it means to preserve diversity and introduce an efficient aggregation mechanism that transfers diversity to the randomized output without incurring additional privacy cost. Our method can be implemented with only API access to proprietary models and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing "cold" PATE aggregators. Empirically, Hot PATE achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement on in-context learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: Language models for code (CodeLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code-related tasks, outperforming traditional methods and standard machine learning approaches. However, these models are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, drawing increasing research attention from domains such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Despite the growing body of research focused on the security of CodeLMs, a comprehensive survey in this area remains absent. To address this gap, we systematically review 67 relevant papers, organizing them based on attack and defense strategies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of commonly used language models, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight open-source tools and promising directions for future research in securing CodeLMs.</description>

      <title>Test-time Adversarial Defense with Opposite Adversarial Path and High Attack Time Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks by injecting sophisticated designed perturbations to input data. Training-time defenses still exhibit a significant performance gap between natural accuracy and robust accuracy. In this paper, we investigate a new test-time adversarial defense method via diffusion-based recovery along opposite adversarial paths (OAPs). We present a purifier that can be plugged into a pre-trained model to resist adversarial attacks. Different from prior arts, the key idea is excessive denoising or purification by integrating the opposite adversarial direction with reverse diffusion to push the input image further toward the opposite adversarial direction. For the first time, we also exemplify the pitfall of conducting AutoAttack (Rand) for diffusion-based defense methods. Through the lens of time complexity, we examine the trade-off between the effectiveness of adaptive attack and its computation complexity against our defense. Experimental evaluation along with time cost analysis verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Securing Federated Learning against Backdoor Threats with Foundation Model Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has enhanced performance but introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit FM vulnerabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs. During global model fusion, these backdoors are transferred to the global model through compromised synthetic data, subsequently infecting all client models. Existing FL backdoor defenses are ineffective against this novel attack due to its fundamentally different mechanism compared to classic ones. In this work, we propose a novel data-free defense strategy that addresses both classic and novel backdoor attacks in FL. The shared attack pattern lies in the abnormal activations within the hidden feature space during model aggregation. Hence, we propose to constrain internal activations to remain within reasonable ranges, effectively mitigating attacks while preserving model functionality. The activation constraints are optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new attack vectors, such as cognitive bias, prompt injection, and jailbreaking, have emerged. Understanding these attacks promotes system robustness improvement and neural networks demystification. However, existing surveys often target attack taxonomy and lack in-depth analysis like 1) unified insights into adversariality, transferability, and generalization; 2) detailed evaluations framework; 3) motivation-driven attack categorizations; and 4) an integrated perspective on both traditional and LVLM attacks. This article addresses these gaps by offering a thorough summary of traditional and LVLM adversarial attacks, emphasizing their connections and distinctions, and providing actionable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>A Quality-Centric Framework for Generic Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images, particularly deepfakes, has become increasingly crucial, with the primary challenge being the generalization to previously unseen manipulation methods. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging the forgery quality of training data to improve the generalization performance of existing deepfake detectors. Generally, the forgery quality of different deepfakes varies: some have easily recognizable forgery clues, while others are highly realistic. Existing works often train detectors on a mix of deepfakes with varying forgery qualities, potentially leading detectors to short-cut the easy-to-spot artifacts from low-quality forgery samples, thereby hurting generalization performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel quality-centric framework for generic deepfake detection, which is composed of a Quality Evaluator, a low-quality data enhancement module, and a learning pacing strategy that explicitly incorporates forgery quality into the training process. Our framework is inspired by curriculum learning, which is designed to gradually enable the detector to learn more challenging deepfake samples, starting with easier samples and progressing to more realistic ones. We employ both static and dynamic assessments to assess the forgery quality, combining their scores to produce a final rating for each training sample. The rating score guides the selection of deepfake samples for training, with higher-rated samples having a higher probability of being chosen. Furthermore, we propose a novel frequency data augmentation method specifically designed for low-quality forgery samples, which helps to reduce obvious forgery traces and improve their overall realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can be applied plug-and-play to existing detection models and significantly enhance their generalization performance in detection.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Bounds for Scalar Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents tight upper and lower bounds for minimum number of samples (copies of a quantum state) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters estimation using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. Particularly, the best-case (optimal) scenario is considered by minimizing the sample complexity over all differentially-private channels; the worst-case channels can be arbitrarily uninformative and render the problem ill-defined. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under local differential privacy. The lower bound however loosens in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$. The upper bound for the minimum number of samples is generalized to qudits (with dimension $d$) resulting in sample complexity of $O(d\epsilon^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Enhancing the Transferability of Jailbreaking Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks can effectively manipulate open-source large language models (LLMs) to produce harmful responses. However, these attacks exhibit limited transferability, failing to disrupt proprietary LLMs consistently. To reliably identify vulnerabilities in proprietary LLMs, this work investigates the transferability of jailbreaking attacks by analysing their impact on the model's intent perception. By incorporating adversarial sequences, these attacks can redirect the source LLM's focus away from malicious-intent tokens in the original input, thereby obstructing the model's intent recognition and eliciting harmful responses. Nevertheless, these adversarial sequences fail to mislead the target LLM's intent perception, allowing the target LLM to refocus on malicious-intent tokens and abstain from responding. Our analysis further reveals the inherent distributional dependency within the generated adversarial sequences, whose effectiveness stems from overfitting the source LLM's parameters, resulting in limited transferability to target LLMs. To this end, we propose the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which uniformly disperses the model's focus across neutral-intent tokens in the original input, thus obscuring malicious-intent tokens without relying on overfitted adversarial sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiF provides an effective and efficient red-teaming evaluation for proprietary LLMs.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow APIs beyond foundation models. In particular, we demonstrate that many SoTA data synthesizers that do not rely on neural networks--such as computer graphics-based image generators, which we refer to as simulators--can be effectively integrated into PE. This insight significantly broadens PE's applicability and unlocks the potential of powerful simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across four diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x, reducing FID by up to 80%, and offering much greater efficiency. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within PE to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</description>

      <title>DPZV: Elevating the Tradeoff between Privacy and Utility in Zeroth-Order Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative training with feature-partitioned data, yet remains vulnerable to privacy leakage through gradient transmissions. Standard differential privacy (DP) techniques such as DP-SGD are difficult to apply in this setting due to VFL's distributed nature and the high variance incurred by vector-valued noise. On the other hand, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization techniques can avoid explicit gradient exposure but lack formal privacy guarantees. In this work, we propose DPZV, the first ZO optimization framework for VFL that achieves tunable DP with performance guarantees. DPZV overcomes these limitations by injecting low-variance scalar noise at the server, enabling controllable privacy with reduced memory overhead. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis showing that DPZV matches the convergence rate of first-order optimization methods while satisfying formal ($\epsilon, \delta$)-DP guarantees. Experiments on image and language benchmarks demonstrate that DPZV outperforms several baselines in terms of accuracy under a wide range of privacy constraints ($\epsilon \le 10$), thereby elevating the privacy-utility tradeoff in VFL.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on Time Series Classification in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a cornerstone of modern web applications, powering tasks such as financial data analysis, network traffic monitoring, and user behavior analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</description>

Abstract: We propose a blockchain architecture in which mining requires a quantum computer. The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave(TM) quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [King et al. Science 2025], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining while providing a quantum-safe layer of security. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Generated Peer Reviews</title>

Abstract: The integrity of peer review is fundamental to scientific progress, but the rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced concerns that some reviewers may rely on these tools to generate reviews rather than writing them independently. Although some venues have banned LLM-assisted reviewing, enforcement remains difficult as existing detection tools cannot reliably distinguish between fully generated reviews and those merely polished with AI assistance. In this work, we address the challenge of detecting LLM-generated reviews. We consider the approach of performing indirect prompt injection via the paper's PDF, prompting the LLM to embed a covert watermark in the generated review, and subsequently testing for presence of the watermark in the review. We identify and address several pitfalls in na\"ive implementations of this approach. Our primary contribution is a rigorous watermarking and detection framework that offers strong statistical guarantees. Specifically, we introduce watermarking schemes and hypothesis tests that control the family-wise error rate across multiple reviews, achieving higher statistical power than standard corrections such as Bonferroni, while making no assumptions about the nature of human-written reviews. We explore multiple indirect prompt injection strategies--including font-based embedding and obfuscated prompts--and evaluate their effectiveness under various reviewer defense scenarios. Our experiments find high success rates in watermark embedding across various LLMs. We also empirically find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice. In contrast, we find that Bonferroni-style corrections are too conservative to be useful in this setting.</description>

      <title>Think Twice Before You Act: Enhancing Agent Behavioral Safety with Thought Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents possess capabilities such as reasoning, tool invocation, and environment interaction, enabling the execution of complex multi-step tasks. The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution for the LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Phare: A Safety Probe for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</description>
