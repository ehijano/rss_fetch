      <title>Scalable Climate Data Analysis: Balancing Petascale Fidelity and Computational Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing resolution and volume of climate data from remote sensing and simulations pose significant storage, processing, and computational challenges. Traditional compression or subsampling methods often compromise data fidelity, limiting scientific insights. We introduce a scalable ecosystem that integrates hierarchical multiresolution data management, intelligent transmission, and ML-assisted reconstruction to balance accuracy and efficiency. Our approach reduces storage and computational costs by 99\%, lowering expenses from \$100,000 to \$24 while maintaining a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 1.46 degrees Celsius. Our experimental results confirm that even with significant data reduction, essential features required for accurate climate analysis are preserved. Validated on petascale NASA climate datasets, this solution enables cost-effective, high-fidelity climate analysis for research and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Tangent point position and atmosphere composition in limb scanning instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the forward model for limb-scanning instruments, ray tracing must be accounted for because variations in air refractivity cause the lines of sight to bend from straight paths into curves. The tangent point of a line of sight is defined as the minimum height point. The lines of sight can be adjusted by varying the nadir angles of the instrument, which must be calibrated to account for Earth's ellipticity and the actual atmospheric conditions sampled by these paths. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the nadir angles, atmospheric properties, and tangent point positions, using a configuration relevant to the CAIRT instrument. Atmospheric data from reanalysis databases are utilized, and the lines of sight are determined by numerically solving the Eikonal equation. Our findings are compared to those of a previous study conducted for the MIPAS instrument, highlighting key differences.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations unravel intensification mechanisms of pyrocumulonimbus clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorms -- wildfire-generated thunderstorms -- can trigger rapid fire spread. However, the multi-physics nature of pyroCb has made their core mechanisms inaccessible to direct observation and previous simulation and prediction efforts. We introduce a new simulation capability with the first high-resolution, fully coupled simulations of a pyroCb, allowing us to unravel its life cycle governed by two opposing mechanisms. We show fuel moisture is an energy sink that attenuates fire intensity rather than fueling clouds, resolving a long-standing debate. Conversely, we identify the driver of rapid intensification: the Self-Amplifying Fire-Induced Recirculation (SAFIR) mechanism, where precipitation-induced downdrafts intensify the parent fire under weak winds. This work provides a new mechanistic framework for pyroCb prediction and demonstrates a transformative computational approach for previously intractable problems in environmental science.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>
