      <title>Uncertainty band evaluation of optical potentials and differential cross-sections. Application to $^8$Li + $^{58}$Ni elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical method is presented to evaluate the uncertainty bands in the optical nucleus-nucleus potential and in differential cross sections. The starting point is the least square fit of a set of experimental values of elastic differential cross sections, varying the relevant optical potential parameters. This is done using standard $\chi^2$ minimization codes, that provide the covariance matrix of the parameters. A maximum likelihood exploration of the $\chi^2$ surface in parameter space allows to determine the covariance matrix of the parameters associated to a contour of a given $\chi^2$ value. Bayes theorem allows to assign probabilities (p-values) to the regions in parameter space, characterized by $\chi^2$ contours. The method allows to obtain uncertainty bands of an arbitrary observables associated to a given p-value using two approaches. The general approach determines the extremes of the observables calculated in the region of parameter space associated to that p-value. This requires an adequate sampling of parameter space, and explicit calculations of the observables on all sampling points. The simplified approach considers uncertainty propagation of the observable in terms of the optical model parameters. This involves the least-square covariance matrix, given by $\chi^2$ minimization codes, and analytically calculated enhancement factors for each p-value. The method, in the general and simplified approaches, is applied to recent measurements of the elastic differential cross sections of $^8$Li + $^{58}$Ni. $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ uncertainty bands are obtained for the optical potentials as a function of the distance, and the differential cross sections as a function of the angle. The general and simplified approaches are very similar in this case. The application of the procedure to determine uncertainty bands of complex scattering calculations is discussed.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-decay properties of $N=Z$ nuclei: Role of neutron-proton pairing and the shell model interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recently measured beta-decay of $^{70}$Kr into $^{70}$Br within the framework of the large-scale shell model. The enhancement in the Gamow-Teller (GT) transition strength in $^{70}$Br compared to the $\beta$-decay of the lighter $^{62}$Ge was suggested as an indication for increased neutron-proton ($np$) pairing correlation. To explore the $np$ correlations in nuclei, we systematically examined the $\beta$-decay properties of the even-even nuclei $A=58,62,66,$ and $70$ into $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei. By employing an interaction involving solely $J=1, T=0$ and $J=0, T=1$ pairing matrix elements, we observe that the pairing does not necessarily lead to an enhancement in the GT strength for the same coupling strength. But with the inclusion of the $g_{9/2}$ orbital, the GT strength can be increased with increasing $np$ pairing in connection with the enhanced contribution from the $g_{9/2}$ orbital. We further compare those results with realistic calculations in the $fp$ and $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space to gauge the contribution from $f_{7/2}$ and $g_{9/2}$ orbitals in the GT strengths. With the JUN45 interaction, there is an increment for the yrast $1^+$ state for the decay of $^{70}$Kr as compared to the decay of $^{62}$Ge due to increased $g_{9/2}$ contribution. Additionally, we probe the effect of $np$ pairing on $B_{\rm GT}$ by modifying the single-particle energies and the $T = 0$ matrix elements of the interaction responsible for the decay transition strength. In calculations with realistic interaction, we find that the accumulated transition strength can increase with enhanced $np$ pairing.</description>

      <title>Monopole and Seniority Truncations in the Large-Scale Configuration Interaction Shell Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of solving the quantum many-body problem, particularly within nuclear physics, through the configuration interaction (CI) method. Large-scale shell model calculations often become computationally infeasible for systems with a large number of valence particles, requiring truncation techniques. We propose truncation methods for the nuclear shell model, in which angular momentum is conserved and rotational symmetry is restored. We introduce the monopole-interaction-based truncation and seniority truncation strategies, designed to reduce the dimension of the calculations. These truncations can be established by considering certain partitions based on their importance and selecting physically meaningful states. We examine these truncations for Sn, Xe, and Pb isotopes, demonstrating their effectiveness in overcoming computational limits. These truncations work well for systems with either a single type of valence nucleon or with both types. With these truncations, we are able to achieve good convergence for the energy at a very small portion of the total dimension.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TD-CDFT) combined with angular momentum projection is developed and applied to study multinucleon transfer (MNT) reactions, with a focus on the intrinsic angular momentum distributions of the final fragments. Using the illustrative reaction $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb across a range of impact parameters, we find that the MNT process generates broad distributions of intrinsic spins. These distributions arise from the conversion of relative orbital angular momentum into intrinsic spin due to frictional interactions between the colliding nuclei. Additionally, mutual information (entanglement Shannon entropy) is employed to analyze correlations between the intrinsic spins of the fragments.</description>

      <title>M1 dipole strength from projected generator coordinate method calculations in the sd-shell valence space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy enhancement observed in the deexcitation $\gamma$-ray strength functions, attributed to magnetic dipole (M1) radiations, has spurred theoretical efforts to improve on its description. Among the most widely used approaches are the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) and its extensions. However, these methods often struggle to reproduce the correct behavior of the M1 strength at the lowest $\gamma$ energies. An alternative framework, the projected generator coordinate method (PGCM), offers significant advantages over QRPA by restoring broken symmetries and incorporating both vibrational and rotational dynamics within a unified description. Due to these features, PGCM has been proposed as a promising tool to study the low-energy M1 strength function in atomic nuclei. However, comprehensive investigations employing this method are lacking. The PGCM is presently used within the frame of sd-shell valence space calculations based on the USDB shell-model interaction to benchmark its performance against the solutions obtained via exact diagonalization. The reliability of two different sets of generator coordinates in the PGCM calculations is gauged using ${}^{24}$Mg as a test case. The ability of the PGCM to reproduce results from exact diagonalization in the sd valence space is demonstrated for $1^{+}$ states and M1 transitions. Future work will need to assess whether the proposed method can be applied systematically and extended to large-scale calculations while maintaining a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Coherent State Path Integral Reveals Unexpected Vacuum Structure in Thermal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the path integral formulation of the partition function for a free scalar thermal field theory using coherent states, first in the ladder operator basis and then in the field operator basis. In so doing, we provide for the first time a mapping in quantum field theory between the field-basis coherent states and ladder-basis coherent states. Using either basis, one finds terms missed in the usual path integral derivation, which we identify as the vacuum energy contribution to the partition function. We then extend the field-basis coherent state method to the interacting $\phi^4$ theory. In addition to the vacuum energy contribution, one finds a coupling of a vacuum expectation value to the mass term that is absent in the existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of out-of-equilibrium dense viscous fluids is of key importance to accurate descriptions of physical systems such as compact stars, particularly their mergers. We consider a near-equilibrium relativistic fluid with $n$ independent and small chemical potentials restoring the system back towards equilibrium. By diagonalising the evolution equation for the out-of-equilibrium chemical potentials, we construct an explicit evolution equation for the bulk scalar of the system in second-order hydrodynamics in terms of equilibrium quantities. We find expressions for the $2n$ transport quantities and show that in the rest frame of the fluid, the system admits a Green's function corresponding to an $n$-component fluid.</description>

      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects associated with the occupation of unbound $fp$ shells. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which impacts the observed $B(E2)$ trend.</description>

      <title>Calculation of low-energy scattering parameters using artificial oscillator trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a recipe to estimate the low-energy scattering parameters of a quantum few-body system - scattering length, effective range, and shape parameter - by using only discrete state calculations. We place the system in an artificial oscillator trap of appropriate size and calculate the energies of the resulting discrete states close to the threshold of the system. The low-energy scattering parameters are then extracted - using a simple analytic formula - from the functional dependence of these energies upon the trap size. We first test the recipe against a simple model problem and then apply it to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering within the nuclear Model with Explicit Mesons in one sigma-meson approximation.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of recent $\Xi$-nuclear bound state signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J-PARC E05 reported recently a hint of a $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ nuclear state in the ${^{12}}{\rm C}(K^-,K^+){^{12}_{\Xi}}{\rm Be}$ spectrum, bound by $B_{\Xi^-}=8.9\pm 1.4 {^{+3.8}_{-3.1}}$ MeV. Using a density-dependent $\Xi$-nuclear optical potential $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ we explore to what extent a $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment of this nuclear state is compatible with $\Xi^-_{1s}$ and $\Xi^-_{1p}$ nuclear-state interpretations of $\Xi^-$ capture events in light emulsion-nuclei experiments. We find that the only acceptable $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment at present, barring an abnormally strong repulsive $\rho^2$ component of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$, is that for the $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ signal. This finding supports reassigning $\Xi^-$ capture events in $^{14}$N, originally assigned as $\Xi^-_{1s}-{^{14}{\rm N}}$ nuclear states, to $\Xi^0_{1p}-{^{14}{\rm C}}$ nuclear states. The depth of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$ is then $-V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho_0)\sim 21$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Oscillation Modes in Hybrid Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum mass, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. We confirm the well-known overestimation of $f$-mode frequencies by the Cowling approximation (by about 10-30\%) compared to full General Relativity calculation, and show that this discrepancy persists across models including hyperons, $\Delta$ baryons, and a phase transition to quark matter. While the discrepancy generally decreases with stellar mass, it increases near the maximum mass in the presence of a phase transition compared to EoSs without this phenomenology. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. These deviations could provide distinct observational signatures in gravitational wave data, offering new insights into dense matter physics and advancing gravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron star interiors. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of quarkonia in vortical quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits a significant signal. We propose a possible mechanism for spin alignment through spin dependent dissociation of quarkonia in a vortical quark-gluon plasma. The spin dependent dissociation is realized through inelastic scattering between constituents of quarkonium and those of quark-gluon plasma polarized by the vorticity. The spin dependent dissociation rate is found to depend on the directions of vorticity, quantization axis, and quark momentum. We implement our results in a dissociation dominated evolution model for quarkonia in the Bjorken flow, finding the spin $0$ state is slightly suppressed compared to the average of the other two, which is consistent with the sign found in experiments. We also find absence of logarithmic enhancement in binding energy in the vortical correction to dissociation rate, which is understood from the requirement that a spin dependent dissociation can only come from quark coupling to a pair of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Pions and Kaons in the QCD Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities using the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel and higher resolution using renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric muon-antimuon emission from $Z^0$ decays: a clear magnetometer in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a very clear signal of the presence of a strong magnetic field during the early stage of a high-energy heavy-ion collision is provided by the decay of the $Z^0$ into dimuon pairs. We find that the process is highly anisotropic, producing pairs mainly out of plane, as signaled by a negative value of $v_2$, and leads to an antimuon transverse momentum distribution which peaks at a higher value of the transverse momentum compared to the peak of the muon transverse momentum distribution. We also show that the process does not produce a significant distortion of the $Z^0$ spectral function. The signal can be identified by comparing the dimuon-invariant mass and the individual muon and antimuon spectra produced in semicentral heavy-ion collisions with the corresponding scaled spectra produced in p+p collisions at the $Z^0$ peak.</description>
