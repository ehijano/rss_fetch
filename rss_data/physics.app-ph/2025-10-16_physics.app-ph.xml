      <title>Impact of irradiation conditions on the magnetic field sensitivity of spin defects in hBN nano flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres generated by helium focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation in thin ($\sim$70 nm) hBN nanoflakes, in order to investigate the effect of implantation conditions on the key parameters that influence the magnetic field sensitivity of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors. Using a combination of photoluminescence, optically detected magnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopy, we examine the competing factors of maximising signal intensity through larger $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ concentration against the degradation in spin coherence and lattice quality observed at high ion fluences. Our results indicate that both the $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin properties and hBN lattice parameters are largely preserved up to an ion fluence of $10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, and beyond this significant degradation occurs in both. At the optimal implantation dose, an AC magnetic sensitivity of $\sim 1\,\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is achieved. Using the patterned implantation enabled by the FIB, we find that $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres and the associated lattice damage are well localised to the implanted regions. This work demonstrates how careful selection of fabrication parameters can be used to optimise the properties of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres in hBN, supporting their application as quantum sensors based on 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A Novel Beam Tracking Approach for Preventing Beam Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issue of beam collapse resulting from instantaneous instability during switch transitions in beam tracking, this paper proposes a novel beam switching method based on a row-by-row switching code table. The paper first establishes an abstract model of the beam tracking application scenario and introduces the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) employed in this paper. Subsequently, simulations are conducted to compare the conventional direct beam switching method with the proposed row-by-row switching code table approach, thereby elucidating the advantages and limitations of the new method. In parallel, a RIS hardware platform is constructed in a microwave anechoic chamber for experimental validation. Both simulation and experimental results show that, by incorporating intermediate state transitions, the approach achieves beam tracking without beam collapse while incurring no significant gain loss. Finally, the paper discusses the applicability scope and potential scenarios for the proposed method. This research provides valuable insights for applications in mobile communications and radar detection.</description>

      <title>A combined thermal-resistance-capacity and finite-element model for very fast and accurate short- and medium-term simulations of single U-tube borehole heat exchangers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate design of a ground-coupled heat pump system requires the knowledge of the outlet fluid temperature from the borehole heat exchangers (BHEs), both in the short and long term. This paper fucuses on the short and medium term. In this time range, either 3D finite-element simulations or Thermal Resistance Capacity Models (TRCMs) can be applied. The former can yield very accurate results but require long computation times. The latter are much faster but cannot be fully precise, because they require simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we present a new method for the short-term and medium-term simulation of single U-tube BHEs, which combines the speed of TRCMs and the accuracy of finite-elements simulations. The method uses a TRCM to estimate the thermal response of the BHE, then corrects the results by interpolation with a dataset, which has been produced by running 54 finite-element simulations in various configurations. The model is implemented in a C++ program, available at the open-source online data repository of the University of Bologna. The program provides, within two seconds, the time evolution of the inlet, outlet and mean fluid temperature, of the mean BHE surface temperature, of the 3D and the effective borehole thermal resistance. It can be easily connected to long-term simulation tools to obtain the full-time-scale thermal response of a bore field.</description>

      <title>Layered Bimetal Nanoporous Platforms for SERS Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size, and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study (comprising morphological analyses, numerical modelling, and optical spectroscopies) on bi-metal nanoporous platforms prepared with a dry-synthesis method enabling the easy and controllable fabrication of bilayers combining different metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Zero Reflection and Perfect Absorption via Exceptional Points in Active Piezoelectric Willis Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-momentum coupling in piezoelectric metamaterials with broken inversion symmetry enables asymmetric elastic wave transport by linking macroscopic electric fields to momentum, an effect analogous to Willis coupling in elastic media. A one-dimensional layered piezoelectric metamaterial integrated with shunt circuits, consisting of a resistor, inductor, and strain-proportional voltage feedback gain, is proposed to achieve dynamic control of frequency-dependent stiffness and damping through electromechanical interactions. Tuning the circuit parameters yields direction-dependent wave scattering at targeted frequencies. Dynamic homogenization reveals macroscopic constitutive relations exhibiting both Willis and electro-momentum couplings. Non-Hermitian exceptional points are identified, where scattering eigenmodes coalesce and produce extreme asymmetries in wave response. Near these points, the system realizes unidirectional zero reflection (UZR) and unidirectional perfect absorption (UPA), achieving complete absorption from one direction and total reflection from the opposite side. The findings demonstrate a compact and reconfigurable platform for tunable, directional elastic wave control using passive-active hybrid metamaterials, opening new avenues for programmable devices in acoustic isolation, wave-based computing, sensing, and energy manipulation in solid media.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Temperature Control by Chiral Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low power consumption is critical for smart windows for temperature control and privacy. The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals exhibit strong coupling of the ferroelectric polarization with electric fields, making them promising candidates for energy-efficient electrochromic devices. Here we investigate the electrochromic properties of a room temperature chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal in films with in-plane electrodes, where the electric field is perpendicular to the helical axis. We demonstrate that smart windows based on this material can regulate interior temperatures within a 10 Celsius range using only 50 milliwatt per square meter specific power, achieving fifty percent larger temperature modulation and 50-100 times lower power consumption than polymer dispersed and polymer stabilized liquid crystal windows. These findings suggest that chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals offer a highly efficient approach for smart window applications, potentially surpassing existing electrochromic technologies in energy efficiency and thermal regulation.</description>

      <title>Origin of the voltage gap and recombination losses in all-perovskite tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-perovskite tandem solar cells with narrow and wide bandgap perovskite absorbers are promising candidates for low-cost and high efficiency photovoltaic applications. However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the single-junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional electro-optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most towards the voltage gap and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should focus on reducing nonradiative recombination losses within the narrow band gap absorber.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Electroluminescence and Photoluminescence Imaging of Mixed-Cation Mixed-Halide Perovskite Solar Cells at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for high-performance solar cells. This study investigates the temperature-dependent optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells using electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) hyperspectral imaging, along with current-voltage analysis. Luminescence images, which were converted to EL and PL external radiative efficiency (ERE) maps, revealed significant changes in the optoelectronic behavior of these devices at low temperatures. Specifically, we found that a significant source of heterogeneity in the low-temperature EL ERE maps below 240 K is related to local charge injection and extraction bottlenecks, whereas PL ERE maps show suppressed non-radiative recombination and significant improvements in efficiency throughout the investigated temperature range. The spatial distribution of ERE and its variation with applied current were analyzed, offering insights into charge-carrier dynamics and defect behavior. Our results reveal that while the perovskite layer exhibits enhanced ERE at low temperatures, charge injection barriers at the interfaces of the perovskite solar cells significantly suppress EL and degrade the fill factor below 240 K. These findings reveal that a deeper understanding of the performance of perovskite solar cells under low-temperature conditions is an essential step toward their potential application in space power systems and advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>A 2-bit Ku-band Digital Metasurface with Infinitely Scalable Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the design and implementation of a 2-bit digaital metasurface operating in the Ku-band, engineered to exhibit advanced polarization conversion characteristics and support dual-polarization control for both X- and Y-polarizations. To address the challenge of array size scalability hindered by extensive DC control routing in 2-bit metasurfaces, we propose a novel RF-DC separation architecture. This approach integrates the metasurface and DC control circuitry onto separate printed circuit boards (PCBs), interconnected via pin cascading, enabling theoretically unlimited two-dimensional array expansion. To validate this design, a ${4\times16 \times 16}$ metasurface prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated, which can achieve a gain of 28.3dB and an aperture efficiency of 21.02\%, confirming the scalability and performance of the proposed architecture. The developed 2-bit high-gain metasurface offers significant reference value for applications in long-distance communication and radar detection. Furthermore, the RF-DC separation architecture introduces a pioneering framework for large-scale metasurface deployment in practical engineering scenarios, enhancing design flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Theory of Metasurface Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) mimic the idealized boundary condition of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), which reflects electromagnetic waves with a preserved electric field and inverted magnetic field. Despite their usefulness, existing AMC implementations often rely on complex or impractical designs, and lack a clear electromagnetic theory explaining their behavior, especially under oblique or polarization-diverse incidence. This work addresses these limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC metasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that achieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific set of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form expressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole contributions. A physically realizable, asymmetric metasurface structure is then designed to satisfy these theoretical conditions. Despite its geometric asymmetry, the proposed structure exhibits a isotropic PMC response at resonance, confirmed by full-wave simulations and multipolar susceptibility extraction. These results demonstrate how properly engineered surface multipoles can yield angularly independent magnetic boundary conditions using only thin, passive metallic layers. This work bridges the gap between AMC design and electromagnetic theory, and enables a new class of angle-independent metasurface reflectors for more accurate simulations, optimizations and innovative AMC designs.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic temperature dependence and hysteresis of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Resonate-and-Fire Photonic-Electronic Spiking Neurons for Fast and Efficient Light-Enabled Neuromorphic Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the spiking dynamics of biological neurons for brain-inspired computation. While electronic implementations of artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast, energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless, existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing. Our approach establishes a pathway toward low-power, high-speed temporal information processing for light-enabled neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $\ket{001} \leftrightarrow \ket{110}$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding $98\%$ under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules, which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$ absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz. A physically constrained nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution, precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high performance metrics and relative ease of use.</description>
