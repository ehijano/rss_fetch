      <title>Exact solution of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for a linear system with annealed disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a disordered multi-dimensional linear system in which the interaction parameters vary stochastically in time with defined temporal correlations. We refer to this type of disorder as "annealed", in contrast to quenched disorder in which couplings are fixed in time. We extend Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to accommodate annealed disorder and employ it to find the exact solution of the linear model in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom. Our analysis yields analytical results for the non-stationary auto-correlation, the stationary variance, the power spectral density, and the phase diagram of the model. Interestingly, some unexpected features emerge upon changing the correlation time of the interactions. The stationary variance of the system and the critical variance of the disorder are generally found to be a non-monotonic function of the correlation time of the interactions. We also find that in some cases a re-entrant phase transition takes place when this correlation time is varied.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Autonomous Control of Minimal Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum devices are reaching new limits in size and complexity, allowing for the experimental exploration of emergent quantum modes. However, this increased complexity introduces significant challenges in device tuning and control. Here, we demonstrate autonomous tuning of emergent Majorana zero modes in a minimal realization of a Kitaev chain. We achieve this task using cross-platform transfer learning. First, we train a tuning model on a theory model. Next, we retrain it using a Kitaev chain realization in a two-dimensional electron gas. Finally, we apply this model to tune a Kitaev chain realized in quantum dots coupled through a semiconductor-superconductor section in a one-dimensional nanowire. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we predict the tunneling and Cooper pair splitting rates from differential conductance measurements, employing these predictions to adjust the electrochemical potential to a Majorana sweet spot. The algorithm successfully converges to the immediate vicinity of a sweet spot (within 1.5 mV in 67.6% of attempts and within 4.5 mV in 80.9% of cases), typically finding a sweet spot in 45 minutes or less. This advancement is a stepping stone towards autonomous tuning of emergent modes in interacting systems, and towards foundational tuning machine learning models that can be deployed across a range of experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Practical and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing leverages quantum systems to solve complex computational tasks with unprecedented efficiency and reduced energy consumption. This paper presents a novel QRC framework utilizing a quantum optical reservoir composed of two-level atoms within a single-mode optical cavity. Employing the Jaynes-Cummings and Tavis-Cummings models, we introduce a scalable and practically measurable reservoir that outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing. We evaluate the reservoir's performance through two primary tasks: the prediction of time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant enhancements in performance with increased numbers of atoms, supported by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. This study confirms the potential of QRC to offer a scalable and efficient solution for advanced computational challenges, marking a significant step forward in the integration of quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion in random two dimensional system with time-reversal symmetry and long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is recognized that Anderson localization takes place for all states at a dimension $d$ less or equal $2$, while delocalization is expected for hopping $V(r)$ decreasing with the distance slower or as $r^{-d}$, the localization problem in the crossover regime for the dimension $d=2$ and hopping $V(r) \propto r^{-2}$ is not resolved yet. Following earlier suggestions we show that for the hopping determined by two-dimensional anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry there exist two distinguishable phases at weak and strong disorder. The first phase is characterized by ergodic dynamics and superdiffusive transport, while the second phase is characterized by diffusive transport and delocalized eigenstates with fractal dimension less than $2$. The transition between phases is resolved analytically using the extension of scaling theory of localization and verified numerically using an exact numerical diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Surface quantum critical phenomena in disordered Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-Anderson disorder driven quantum phase transition in a semi-infinite Dirac semimetal with a flat boundary. The conformally invariant boundary conditions, which include those that are time-reversal invariant, lead to nodal-like surface states on the boundary. In this case the boundary becomes metallic at a critical disorder that is weaker than that for the semimetal-diffusive metal transition in the bulk. The latter transition takes place in the presence of a metallic surface; in the language of surface critical phenomena this corresponds to the so-called extraordinary transition. The lines of the surface and the extraordinary transitions meet at the special transition point. To elucidate universal properties at different transitions on the phase diagram, we employ renormalization group methods and compute the corresponding surface critical exponents using $\varepsilon$-expansion.</description>
