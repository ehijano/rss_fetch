      <title>Fractional medians and their maximal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the fractional medians, give an expression of the set of all fractional medians in terms of non-increasing rearrangements and then investigate mapping properties of the fractional maximal operators defined by such medians. The maximal operator is a generalization of that in Stromberg. It turns out that our maximal operator is a more smooth operator than the usual fractional maximal operator. Further, we give another proof of the embedding from $BV$ to $L^{n/(n-1),1}$ due to Alvino by using the usual medians.</description>

      <title>Two-weight inequality for the heat flow and solvability of Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide two-weight inequalities for the heat flow on the whole space by applying the sparse domination. For power weights, such inequalities were given by several authors. Owing to the sparse domination, we can treat general weights in Muckenhoupt classes. As a application, we present the local and global existence results for the Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation, which has a potential belonging to a Muckenhoupt class.</description>

      <title>Topologies on unparameterised rough path space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature of a $p$-weakly geometric rough path summarises a path up to a generalised notion of reparameterisation. The quotient space of equivalence classes on which the signature is constant yields unparameterised path space. The study of topologies on unparameterised path space, initiated in [CT24b] for paths of bounded variation, has practical bearing on the use of signature based methods in a variety applications. This note extends the majority of results from [CT24b] to unparameterised weakly geometric rough path space. We study three classes of topologies: metrisable topologies for which the quotient map is continuous; the quotient topology derived from the underlying path space; and an explicit metric between the tree-reduced representatives of each equivalence class. We prove that topologies of the first type (under an additional assumption) are separable and Lusin, but not locally compact or completely metrisable. The quotient topology is Hausdorff but not metrisable, while the metric generating the third topology is not complete and its topology is not locally compact. We also show that the third topology is Polish when $p=1$.</description>

      <title>On the Eldan-Gross inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <title>On the regularization of sequences and associated weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and generalize the geometric procedure of regularizing a sequence of real numbers with respect to a so-called regularizing function. This approach was studied by S. Mandelbrojt and becomes useful and necessary when working with corresponding classes of ultradifferentiable functions defined via weight sequences and analogous weighted spaces. In this note we also study non-standard situations for the construction yielding the (log-)convex minorant of a sequence and allow a "blow-up" for the regularizing function.</description>

      <title>A complete Bernstein function related to the fractal dimension of Pascal's pyramid modulo a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f_r(x)=\log(1+rx)/\log(1+x)$ for $x&gt;0$. We prove that $f_r$ is a complete Bernstein function for $0\le r\le 1$ and a Stieltjes function for $1\le r$. This answers a conjecture of David Bradley that $f_r$ is a Bernstein function when $0\le r\le 1$.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Points In Non-Isotropic Neighborhoods of Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we initiate the study of the number of rational points with bounded denominators, contained in a non-isotropic $\delta_1\times\ldots\times \delta_R$ neighborhood of a compact submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ of codimension $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$. We establish an upper bound for this counting function which holds when $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a strong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in \cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when $\delta_1=\ldots=\delta_R=\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to $\mathcal{M}$ established in \cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang \cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.
  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in \cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R&gt;1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points \textit{on} $\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^M$ .</description>
