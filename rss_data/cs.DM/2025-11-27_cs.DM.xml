      <title>Local generation of languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a language, which in this article is a set of strings of some fixed length, we study the problem of producing its elements by a procedure in which each position has its own local rule. We introduce a way of measuring how much communication is needed between positions. The communication structure is captured by a simplicial complex whose vertices are the positions and the simplices are the communication channels between positions. The main problem is then to identify the simplicial complexes that can be used to generate a given language. We develop the theory and apply it to a number of languages.</description>

      <title>$k$-path graphs: experiments and conjectures about algebraic connectivity and $\alpha$-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents conjectures about eigenvalues of matrices associated with $k$-path graphs, the algebraic connectivity, defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, and the $\alpha$-index, as the largest eigenvalue of the $A_{\alpha}$-matrix. For this purpose, a process based in Pereira et al., is presented to generate lists of $k$-path graphs containing all non-isomorphic 2-paths, 3-paths, and 4-paths of order $n$, for $6 \leq n \leq 26, 8 \leq n \leq 19$, and $10 \leq n \leq 18$, respectively. Using these lists, exhaustive searches for extremal graphs of fixed order for the mentioned eigenvalues were performed. Based on the empirical results, conjectures are suggested about the structure of extremal $k$-path graphs for these eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Time Algorithm for the Maximum-Weight $(k, \ell)$-Sparse Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>On the order-diameter ratio of girth-diameter cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integers $k,g,d$, a $(k;g,d)$-cage (or simply girth-diameter cage) is a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ and diameter $d$ (if it exists). The order of a $(k;g,d)$-cage is denoted by $n(k;g,d)$. We determine asymptotic lower and upper bounds for the ratio between the order and the diameter of girth-diameter cages as the diameter goes to infinity. We also prove that this ratio can be computed in constant time for fixed $k$ and $g$.
  We theoretically determine the exact values $n(3;g,d)$, and count the number of corresponding girth-diameter cages, for $g \in \{4,5\}$. Moreover, we design and implement an exhaustive graph generation algorithm and use it to determine the exact order of several open cases and obtain -- often exhaustive -- sets of the corresponding girth-diameter cages. The largest case we generated and settled with our algorithm is a $(3;7,35)$-cage of order 136.</description>

      <title>Spectrally indistinguishable pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit families of graphs whose eigenvalues are asymptotically distributed according to Wigner's semicircle law; in other words, that are spectrally indistinguishable from random graphs. However, in other respects they are strikingly dissimilar from random graphs; for example, they are $K_{2,3}$-free graphs with almost the maximum possible edge density.</description>

      <title>A complete solution of the Erd\H{o}s-Kleitman matching problem for $n\le 3s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given integers $n\ge s\ge 2$, let $e(n,s)$ stand for the maximum size of a family of subsets of an $n$-element set that contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint members. The study of this quantity goes back to the 1960s, when Kleitman determined $e(sm-1,s)$ and $e(sm,s)$ for all integer $m,s\ge 1$. The question of determining $e(n,s)$ is closely connected to its uniform counterpart, the subject of the famous Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture.
  The problem of determining $e(n,s)$ has proven to be very hard and, in spite of some progress during these years, even a general conjecture concerning the value of $e(n,s)$ is missing. In this paper, we completely solve the problem for $n\le 3s$. In this regime, the average size of a set in an $s$-matching is at most $3$, and it is a delicate interplay between the `missing' $2$- and $3$-element sets that plays a key role here. Four types of extremal families appear in the characterization. Our result sheds light on how the extremal function $e(n,s)$ may behave in general.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets in the (in)comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal transversals in a hypergraph is a notoriously hard problem. It can be reduced to enumerating minimal dominating sets in a graph, in fact even to enumerating minimal dominating sets in an incomparability graph. We provide an output-polynomial time algorithm for incomparability graphs whose underlying posets have bounded dimension. Through a different proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets.
  Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space.
  In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Distance-$r$ Dominating Set Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed integer $r \geq 1$, a distance-$r$ dominating set (D$r$DS) of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a vertex subset $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex in $V$ is within distance $r$ from some member of $D$. Given two D$r$DSs $D_s, D_t$ of $G$, the Distance-$r$ Dominating Set Reconfiguration (D$r$DSR) problem asks if there is a sequence of D$r$DSs that transforms $D_s$ into $D_t$ (or vice versa) such that each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor by applying a given reconfiguration rule exactly once. The problem for $r = 1$ has been well-studied in the literature. We consider D$r$DSR for $r \geq 2$ under two well-known reconfiguration rules: Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$, which involves replacing a member of the current D$r$DS by a non-member) and Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$, which involves replacing a member of the current D$r$DS by an adjacent non-member).
  It is known that under any of $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$, the problem on split graphs is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $r = 1$. We show that for $r \geq 2$, the problem is in $\mathtt{P}$, resulting in an interesting complexity dichotomy. Along the way, we prove some non-trivial bounds on the length of a shortest reconfiguration sequence on split graphs when $r = 2$ which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we design a linear-time algorithm under $\mathsf{TJ}$ on trees. On the negative side, we show that D$r$DSR for $r \geq 1$ on planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete, improving the degree bound of previously known results. We also show that the known $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-completeness results under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ for $r = 1$ on bipartite graphs and chordal graphs can be extended for $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Spanning Tree Congestion using Hereditary Bisection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Spanning Tree Congestion (STC) problem is the following NP-hard problem: given a graph $G$, construct a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ minimizing its maximum edge congestion where the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv$ in $G$ such that the unique path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$ passes through $e$; the optimal value for a given graph $G$ is denoted $STC(G)$.
  It is known that every spanning tree is an $n/2$-approximation for the STP problem. A long-standing problem is to design a better approximation algorithm. Our contribution towards this goal is an $O(\Delta\cdot\log^{3/2}n)$-approximation algorithm where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in $G$ and $n$ the number of vertices. For graphs with a maximum degree bounded by a polylog of the number of vertices, this is an exponential improvement over the previous best approximation.
  Our main tool for the algorithm is a new lower bound on the spanning tree congestion which is of independent interest. Denoting by $hb(G)$ the hereditary bisection of $G$ which is the maximum bisection width over all subgraphs of $G$, we prove that for every graph $G$, $STC(G)\geq \Omega(hb(G)/\Delta)$.</description>
