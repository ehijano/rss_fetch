      <title>Semi-local one-dimensional optical wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional optical wave turbulence described by the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger-Helmholtz model for nonlinear light propagation in spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical media such as nematic liquid crystals. By exploiting the specific structure of the nonlocal response, we derive a reduced wave kinetic equation under a semi-local approximation that permits the study of weak-wave turbulent cascades. We explore the realisability of the wave turbulence predictions and demonstrate new turbulent behaviour related to spatial nonlocality. Moreover, we show strong dependence of the wave turbulence to the possible presence of incoherent solitonic structures.</description>

      <title>Effective transport barriers in the biquadratic nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nontwist area-preserving maps violate the twist condition at specific orbits, resulting in shearless invariant curves that prevent chaotic transport. Plasmas and fluids with nonmonotonic equilibrium profiles may be described using nontwist systems, where even after these shearless curves breakup, effective transport barriers persist, partially reducing transport coefficients. Some nontwist systems present multiple shearless curves in phase space, increasing the complexity of transport phenomena, which have not been thoroughly investigated until now. In this work, we examine the formation of effective transport barriers in a nontwist area-preserving mapping with multiple shearless transport barriers. By quantifying the effectiveness of each transport barrier in phase space, we identify two scenarios where particular barriers dominate over others. Our results also reveal configurations where the interplay of two transport barriers creates regions in phase space with significant orbit trapping, influencing overall transport dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics creates and destroys branched flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of branched flow, visualized as a chaotic arborescent pattern of propagating particles, waves, or rays, has been identified in disparate physical systems ranging from electrons to tsunamis, with periodic systems only recently being added to this list. Here, we explore the laws governing the evolution of the branches in periodic potentials. On one hand, we observe that branch formation follows a similar pattern in all non-integrable potentials, no matter whether the potentials are periodic or completely irregular. Chaotic dynamics ultimately drives the birth of the branches. On the other hand, our results reveal that for periodic potentials the decay of the branches exhibits new characteristics due to the presence of infinitely stable branches known as superwires. Again, the interplay between branched flow and superwires is deeply connected to Hamiltonian chaos. In this work, we explore the relationships between the laws of branched flow and the structures of phase space, providing extensive numerical and theoretical arguments to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>
