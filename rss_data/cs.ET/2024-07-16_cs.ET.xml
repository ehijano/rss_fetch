      <title>A Case for Application-Aware Space Radiation Tolerance in Orbital Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are witnessing a surge in the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware for cost-effective in-orbit computing, such as deep neural network (DNN) based on-satellite sensor data processing, Earth object detection, and task decision.However, once exposed to harsh space environments, COTS hardware is vulnerable to cosmic radiation and suffers from exhaustive single-event upsets (SEUs) and multi-unit upsets (MCUs), both threatening the functionality and correctness of in-orbit computing.Existing hardware and system software protections against radiation are expensive for resource-constrained COTS nanosatellites and overwhelming for upper-layer applications due to their requirement for heavy resource redundancy and frequent reboots. Instead, we make a case for cost-effective space radiation tolerance using application domain knowledge. Our solution for the on-satellite DNN tasks, \name, exploits the uneven SEU/MCU sensitivity across DNN layers and MCUs' spatial correlation for lightweight radiation-tolerant in-orbit AI computing. Our extensive experiments using Chaohu-1 SAR satellite payloads and a hardware-in-the-loop, real data-driven space radiation emulator validate that RedNet can suppress the influence of radiation errors to $\approx$ 0 and accelerate the on-satellite DNN inference speed by 8.4%-33.0% at negligible extra costs.</description>

      <title>CIRCUITSYNTH: Leveraging Large Language Models for Circuit Topology Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit topology generation plays a crucial role in the design of electronic circuits, influencing the fundamental functionality of the circuit. In this paper, we introduce CIRCUITSYNTH, a novel approach that harnesses LLMs to facilitate the automated synthesis of valid circuit topologies. With a dataset comprising both valid and invalid circuit configurations, CIRCUITSYNTH employs a sophisticated two-phase methodology, comprising Circuit Topology Generation and Circuit Topology Refinement. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CIRCUITSYNTH compared to various fine-tuned LLM variants. Our approach lays the foundation for future research aimed at enhancing circuit efficiency and specifying output voltage, thus enabling the automated generation of circuit topologies with improved performance and adherence to design requirements.</description>

      <title>Conquering images and the basis of transformative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our rapid immersion into online life has made us all ill. Through the generation, personalization, and dissemination of enchanting imagery, artificial technologies commodify the minds and hearts of the masses with nauseating precision and scale. Online networks, artificial intelligence (AI), social media, and digital news feeds fine-tune our beliefs and pursuits by establishing narratives that subdivide and polarize our communities and identities. Meanwhile those commanding these technologies conquer the final frontiers of our interior lives, social relations, earth, and cosmos. In the Attention Economy, our agency is restricted and our vitality is depleted for their narcissistic pursuits and pleasures. Generative AI empowers the forces that homogenize and eradicate life, not through some stupid "singularity" event, but through devaluing human creativity, labor, and social life. Using a fractured lens, we will examine how narratives and networks influence us on mental, social, and algorithmic levels. We will discuss how atomizing imagery -- ideals and pursuits that alienate, rather than invigorate the individual -- hijack people's agency to sustain the forces that destroy them. We will discover how empires build digital networks that optimize society and embolden narcissists to enforce social binaries that perpetuate the ceaseless expansion of consumption, exploitation, and hierarchy. Structural hierarchy in the world is reified through hierarchy in our beliefs and thinking. Only by seeing images as images and appreciating the similarity shared by opposing narratives can we facilitate transformative action and break away from the militaristic systems plaguing our lives.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Metadata: Design and Fabrication of Embedded Markers for Real-World Object Identification and Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of the physical and digital realms has ushered in a new era of immersive experiences and seamless interactions. As the boundaries between the real world and virtual environments blur and result in a "mixed reality," there arises a need for robust and efficient methods to connect physical objects with their virtual counterparts. In this thesis, we present a novel approach to bridging this gap through the design, fabrication, and detection of embedded machine-readable markers.
  We categorize the proposed marking approaches into three distinct categories: natural markers, structural markers, and internal markers. Natural markers, such as those used in SensiCut, are inherent fingerprints of objects repurposed as machine-readable identifiers, while structural markers, such as StructCode and G-ID, leverage the structural artifacts in objects that emerge during the fabrication process itself. Internal markers, such as InfraredTag and BrightMarker, are embedded inside fabricated objects using specialized materials. Leveraging a combination of methods from computer vision, machine learning, computational imaging, and material science, the presented approaches offer robust and versatile solutions for object identification, tracking, and interaction.
  These markers, seamlessly integrated into real-world objects, effectively communicate an object's identity, origin, function, and interaction, functioning as gateways to "ubiquitous metadata" - a concept where metadata is embedded into physical objects, similar to metadata in digital files. Across the different chapters, we demonstrate the applications of the presented methods in diverse domains, including product design, manufacturing, retail, logistics, education, entertainment, security, and sustainability.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Backscatter Connectivity via Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SARComm is a novel wireless communication system that enables passive satellite backscatter connectivity using existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. We demonstrate that SAR signals from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite, used to image Earth's terrain, can be leveraged to enable low-power ground-to-satellite communication. This paper presents the first cooperative, on-the-ground target that modulates SAR backscatter to send information bits and analyzes how to extract them from publicly available Sentinel-1 datasets. To demonstrate the system, we evaluate the effectiveness of modulating the radar cross section of corner reflectors both mechanically and electronically to encode data bits, develop a deployment algorithm to optimize corner reflector placement, and present a SAR processing pipeline to enable communication.</description>

      <title>Advantages of multistage quantum walks over QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods to find the solution state for optimization problems encoded into Ising Hamiltonians are a very active area of current research. In this work we compare the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with multi-stage quantum walks (MSQW). Both can be used as variational quantum algorithms, where the control parameters are optimized classically. A fair comparison requires both quantum and classical resources to be assessed. Alternatively, parameters can be chosen heuristically, as we do in this work, providing a simpler setting for comparisons. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we obtain evidence that MSQW outperforms QAOA, using equivalent resources. We also show numerically for random spin glass ground state problems that MSQW performs well even for few stages and heuristic parameters, with no classical optimization.</description>
