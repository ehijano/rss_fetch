      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity of outer automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the acylindrical hyperbolicity of the outer automorphism group of a right-angled Artin group $A_\Gamma$. When the defining graph $\Gamma$ has no SIL-pair (separating intersection of links), we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ to be acylindrically hyperbolic. As a corollary, if $\Gamma$ is a random connected graph satisfying a certain probabilistic condition, then $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ is not acylindrically hyperbolic with high probability. When $\Gamma$ has a maximal SIL-pair system, we derive a classification theorem for partial conjugations. Such a classification theorem allows us to show that the acylindrical hyperbolicity of $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ is closely related to the existence of a specific type of partial conjugations.</description>

      <title>E-disjunctive inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an overview of the class of inverse semigroups $S$ such that every congruence on $S$ relates at least one idempotent to a non-idempotent; such inverse semigroups are called $E$-disjunctive. This overview includes the study of the inverse semigroup theoretic structure of $E$-disjunctive semigroups; a large number of natural examples; some asymptotic results establishing the rarity of such inverse semigroups; and a general structure theorem for all inverse semigroups where the building blocks are $E$-disjunctive.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of word hyperbolic groups in dimension 2 over arbitrary rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1996, Gersten proved that finitely presented subgroups of a word hyperbolic group of integral cohomological dimension 2 are hyperbolic. We use isoperimetric inequalities over arbitrary rings to extend this result to any ring. In particular, we study the discrete isoperimetric function and show that its linearity is equivalent to hyperbolicity, which is also equivalent to it being subquadratic. We further use these ideas to obtain conditions for subgroups of higher rank hyperbolic groups to be again higher rank hyperbolic of the same rank. The appendix discusses the equivalence between isoperimetric inequalities and coning inequalities in the simplicial setting and the general setting, leading to combinatorial definitions of higher rank hyperbolicity in the setting of simplicial complexes and allowing us to give elementary definitions of higher rank hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>A test for a local formation of finite groups to be a formation of soluble groups with the Shemetkov property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L.A. Shemetkov posed a Problem 9.74 in Kourovka Notebook to find all local formations $\mathfrak{F}$ of finite groups such that every finite minimal non-$\mathfrak{F}$-group is either a Schmidt group or a group of prime order. All known solutions to this problem are obtained under the assumption that every minimal non-$\mathfrak{F}$-group is soluble. Using the above mentioned solutions we present a polynomial in $n$ time check for a local formation $\mathfrak{F}$ with bounded $\pi(\mathfrak{F})$ to be a formation of soluble groups with the Shemtkov property where $n=\max \pi(\mathfrak{F})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study the class of inner ultrahomogeneous groups, which includes Hall's universal group and the universal locally recursively presentable group. We provide simple criteria for ample generic automorphisms, straight maximality, uniform simplicity and divisibility (all of which apply to both Hall's universal group and the universal locally recursively presentable group). We show that such groups of infinite exponent are not $\aleph_0$-saturated, their theories are not small, not rosy and have TP$_2$+SOP+IP$_n$ for all $n$. This strengthens and generalises known results about ample generic automorphisms and unstability of Hall's universal group. We also show that the exponents of finite exponent inner ultrahomogeneous groups are uniformly bounded, and we provide a series of examples of inner ultrahomogeneous groups.</description>

      <title>Regular bipartite multigraphs have many (but not too many) symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ and $l$ be integers, both at least 2. A $(k,l)$-bipartite graph is an $l$-regular bipartite multigraph with coloured bipartite sets of size $k$. Define $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ to be the minimum and maximum order of automorphism groups of $(k,l)$-bipartite graphs, respectively. We determine $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ for $k\geq 8$, and analyse the generic situation when $k$ is fixed and $l$ is large. In particular, we show that almost all such graphs have automorphism groups which fix the vertices pointwise and have order far less than $\mu(k,l)$. These graphs are intimately connected with both integer doubly-stochastic matrices and uniform set partitions; we examine the uniform distribution on the set of $k\times k$ integer doubly-stochastic matrices with all line sums $l$, showing that with high probability all entries stray far from the mean. We also show that the symmetric group acting on uniform set partitions is non-synchronizing.</description>

      <title>On Morita equivalences with endopermutation source and isotypies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of equivalence between blocks of finite group algebras called an almost isotypy. An almost isotypy restricts an isotypy in Brou\'{e}'s original definition, and it is close to Linckelmann's version. We show that a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups - which has an endopermutation module as a source and which induces a Morita equivalence - gives rise to an almost isotypy if and only if the character values of a (hence any) source are rational integers. This generalises a previous result of Huang and Zhou. Consequently, if two blocks are Morita equivalent via a bimodule with endopermutation source, then they are almostly isotypic.</description>

Abstract: We present several explicit systems of equations defining exterior square of the general linear group as an affine group scheme. Algebraic ingredients of the equations, exterior numbers, are translated into the language of weight diagrams corresponding to Lie groups of type $A_{n-1}$ in representation with the highest weight $\varpi_{2}$.</description>

Abstract: For the second fundamental representation of the general linear group over a commutative ring $R$ we construct straightforward and uniform polynomial expressions of elementary generators as products of elementary conjugates of an arbitrary matrix and its inverse. Towards the solution we get stabilization theorems for any column of a matrix from $GL_{n \choose 2}(R)$ or from the exterior square of $GL_n(R)$, $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Embedding relatively hyperbolic groups into products of binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ is relatively hyperbolic with respect to virtually abelian peripheral subgroups then $G$ quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. This extends the result of Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder in which they prove that a hyperbolic group quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. To prove the main result, we use the machinery of projection complexes and quasi-trees of metric spaces developed by Bestvina, Bromberg, Fujiwara and Sisto. We build on this theory by proving that one can remove certain edges from the quasi-tree of metric spaces, and be left with a tree of metric spaces which is quasiisometric to the quasi-tree of metric spaces. In particular, this reproves a result of Hume. Further, inspired by Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder's Alice's Diary, we develop a general theory of diaries and linear statistics. These notions provide a framework by which one can take a quasiisometric embedding of a metric space into a product of infinite-valence trees and upgrade it to a quasiisometric embedding into a product of binary trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the question of under what conditions a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries is in the image of the Burau representation. In 1984, Squier observed that the matrices in the image are contained in a unitary group. In 2021, Salter formulated a specific question: whether the central quotient of the Burau image group is the central quotient of a certain subgroup of the unitary group. We solve this question negatively in the simplest nontrivial case, $n=3$, algorithmically constructing a counterexample.</description>

Abstract: We establish several foundational results regarding the Grothendieck-Springer affine fibration. More precisely, we prove some constructibility results on the affine Grothendieck-Springer sheaf and its coinvariants, enrich it with a group of symmetries, analog to the situation of Hitchin fibration, prove some perversity statements once we take some derived coinvariants and construct some specialization morphisms for the homology of affine Springer fibers. Along the way, we prove some homotopy result on l-adic complexes that can also be applied to Hitchin fibration.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial descriptions of biclosed sets in affine type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a Coxeter group and let $\Phi^+$ be its positive roots. A subset $B$ of $\Phi^+$ is called biclosed if, whenever we have roots $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} \alpha + \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} \beta$, if $\alpha$ and $\beta \in B$ then $\gamma \in B$ and, if $\alpha$ and $\beta \not\in B$, then $\gamma \not\in B$. The finite biclosed sets are the inversion sets of the elements of $W$, and the containment between finite inversion sets is the weak order on $W$. Matthew Dyer suggested studying the poset of all biclosed subsets of $\Phi^+$, ordered by containment, and conjectured that it is a complete lattice. As progress towards Dyer's conjecture, we classify all biclosed sets in the affine root systems. We provide both a type uniform description, and concrete models in the classical types $\widetilde{A}$, $\widetilde{B}$, $\widetilde{C}$, $\widetilde{D}$. We use our models to prove that biclosed sets form a complete lattice in types $\widetilde{A}$ and $\widetilde{C}$.</description>

      <title>Towards Information Theory-Based Discovery of Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries imposes a stringent set of constraints on a system. This constrained structure allows intelligent agents interacting with such a system to drastically improve the efficiency of learning and generalization, through the internalisation of the system's symmetries into their information-processing. In parallel, principled models of complexity-constrained learning and behaviour make increasing use of information-theoretic methods. Here, we wish to marry these two perspectives and understand whether and in which form the information-theoretic lens can "see" the effect of symmetries of a system. For this purpose, we propose a novel variant of the Information Bottleneck principle, which has served as a productive basis for many principled studies of learning and information-constrained adaptive behaviour. We show (in the discrete case and under a specific technical assumption) that our approach formalises a certain duality between symmetry and information parsimony: namely, channel equivariances can be characterised by the optimal mutual information-preserving joint compression of the channel's input and output. This information-theoretic treatment furthermore suggests a principled notion of "soft" equivariance, whose "coarseness" is measured by the amount of input-output mutual information preserved by the corresponding optimal compression. This new notion offers a bridge between the field of bounded rationality and the study of symmetries in neural representations. The framework may also allow (exact and soft) equivariances to be automatically discovered.</description>

      <title>The Alperin Weight Conjecture and the Glauberman correspondence via character triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, G. Navarro introduced a new conjecture that unifies the Alperin Weight Conjecture and the Glauberman correspondence into a single statement. In this paper, we reduce this problem to simple groups and prove it for several classes of groups and blocks. Our reduction can be divided into two steps. First, we show that assuming the so-called Inductive (Blockwise) Alperin Weight Condition for finite simple groups, we obtain an analogous statement for arbitrary finite groups, that is, an automorphism-equivariant version of the Alperin Weight Conjecture inducing isomorphisms of modular character triples. Then, we show that the latter implies Navarro's conjecture for each finite group.</description>

      <title>Affine extended weak order is a lattice</title>

Abstract: Coxeter groups are equipped with a partial order known as the weak Bruhat order, such that $u \leq v$ if the inversions of $u$ are a subset of the inversions of $v$. In finite Coxeter groups, weak order is a complete lattice, but in infinite Coxeter groups it is only a meet semi-lattice. Motivated by questions in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, Matthew Dyer introduced a larger poset, now known as extended weak order, which contains the weak Bruhat order as an order ideal and coincides with it for finite Coxeter groups. The extended weak order is the containment order on certain sets of positive roots: those which satisfy a geometric condition making them "biclosed". The finite biclosed sets are precisely the inversion sets of Coxeter group elements. Generalizing the result for finite Coxeter groups, Dyer conjectured that the extended weak order is always a complete lattice, even for infinite Coxeter groups.
  In this paper, we prove Dyer's conjecture for Coxeter groups of affine type. To do so, we introduce the notion of a clean arrangement, which is a hyperplane arrangement where the regions are in bijection with biclosed sets. We show that root poset order ideals in a finite or rank 3 untwisted affine root system are clean. We set up a general framework for reducing Dyer's conjecture to checking cleanliness of certain subarrangements. We conjecture this framework can be used to prove Dyer's conjecture for all Coxeter groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Johnson homomorphisms of basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups. We construct obstructions for the surjectivity of the Johnson homomorphisms. By using it, we determine its cokernels of degree up to four, and give further observations for degree greater than four.
  As applications, we give the affirmative answer for the Andreadakis problem for degree four. We show that the cup product map of the first cohomology groups of the basis-conjugating automorphism group of a free group into the second cohomology group is surjective. Finally, we calculate the twisted first cohomology groups of the braid-permutation automorphism groups of a free group.</description>
