      <title>PRREACH: Probabilistic Risk Assessment Using Reachability for UAV Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for designing risk-bounded controllers for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Existing frameworks for assessing risk of UAV operations rely on knowing the conditional probability of an incident occurring given different causes. Limited data for computing these probabilities makes real-world implementation of these frameworks difficult. Furthermore, existing frameworks do not include control methods for risk mitigation. Our approach relies on UAV dynamics, and employs reachability analysis for a probabilistic risk assessment over all feasible UAV trajectories. We use this holistic risk assessment to formulate a control optimization problem that minimally changes a UAV's existing control law to be bounded by an accepted risk threshold. We call our approach PRReach. Public and readily available UAV dynamics models and open source spatial data for mapping hazard outcomes enables practical implementation of PRReach for both offline pre-flight and online in-flight risk assessment and mitigation. We evaluate PRReach through simulation experiments on real-world data. Results show that PRReach controllers reduce risk by up to 24% offline, and up to 53% online from classical controllers.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Based Neural Network Accelerators for Space Applications: Enhancing Performance with Temporal Averaging and SIRENs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness -- properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft. However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability, conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation. In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \&amp; control and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers, and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around $0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of memristors.</description>

      <title>Indifference-Zone Relaxation Procedures for Finding Feasible Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding feasible systems with respect to stochastic constraints when system performance is evaluated through simulation. Our objective is to solve this problem with high computational efficiency and statistical validity. Existing indifference-zone (IZ) procedures introduce a fixed tolerance level, which denotes how much deviation the decision-maker is willing to accept from the threshold in the constraint. These procedures are developed under the assumption that all systems' performance measures are exactly the tolerance level away from the threshold, leading to unnecessary simulations. In contrast, IZ-free procedures, which eliminate the tolerance level, perform well when systems' performance measures are far from the threshold. However, they may significantly underperform compared to IZ procedures when systems' performance measures are close to the threshold. To address these challenges, we propose the Indifference-Zone Relaxation (IZR) procedure, IZR introduces a set of relaxed tolerance levels and utilizes two subroutines for each level: one to identify systems that are clearly feasible and the other to exclude those that are clearly infeasible. We also develop the IZR procedure with estimation (IZE), which introduces two relaxed tolerance levels for each system and constraint: one matching the original tolerance level and the other based on an estimate of the system's performance measure. By employing different tolerance levels, these procedures facilitate early feasibility determination with statistical validity. We prove that IZR and IZE determine system feasibility with the desired probability and show through experiments that they significantly reduce the number of observations required compared to an existing procedure.</description>

      <title>Resource-Oriented Optimization of Electric Vehicle Systems: A Data-Driven Survey on Charging Infrastructure, Scheduling, and Fleet Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by growing concerns over air quality and energy security, electric vehicles (EVs) has experienced rapid development and are reshaping global transportation systems and lifestyle patterns. Compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, EVs offer significant advantages in terms of lower energy consumption, reduced emissions, and decreased operating costs. However, there are still some core challenges to be addressed: (i) Charging station congestion and operational inefficiencies during peak hours, (ii) High charging cost under dynamic electricity pricing schemes, and (iii) Conflicts between charging needs and passenger service requirements.Hence, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of data-driven models and approaches proposed in the literature to address the above challenges. These studies cover the entire lifecycle of EV systems, including charging station deployment, charging scheduling strategies, and large-scale fleet management. Moreover, we discuss the broader implications of EV integration across multiple domains, such as human mobility, smart grid infrastructure, and environmental sustainability, and identify key opportunities and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Adaptive Covariance Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for predictable and safe covariance steering control of uncertain nonlinear stochastic processes. The systems under consideration are subject to general uncertainties, which include unbounded random disturbances (aleatoric uncertainties) and incomplete model knowledge (state-dependent epistemic uncertainties). These general uncertainties lead to temporally evolving state distributions that are entirely unknown, can have arbitrary shapes, and may diverge unquantifiably from expected behaviors, leading to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors. Our method relies on an $\mathcal{L}_1$-adaptive control architecture that ensures robust control of uncertain stochastic processes while providing Wasserstein metric certificates in the space of probability measures. We show how these distributional certificates can be incorporated into the high-level covariance control steering to guarantee safe control. Unlike existing distributionally robust planning and control methodologies, our approach avoids difficult-to-verify requirements like the availability of finite samples from the true underlying distribution or an a priori knowledge of time-varying ambiguity sets to which the state distributions are assumed to belong.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC: Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning methodologies have attracted considerable attention for the control and estimation of dynamical systems. However, such implementations suffer from a lack of predictability and robustness. Thus, adoption of data-driven tools has been minimal for safety-aware applications despite their impressive empirical results. While classical tools like robust adaptive control can ensure predictable performance, their consolidation with data-driven methods remains a challenge and, when attempted, leads to conservative results. The difficulty of consolidation stems from the inherently different `spaces' that robust control and data-driven methods occupy. Data-driven methods suffer from the distribution-shift problem, which current robust adaptive controllers can only tackle if using over-simplified learning models and unverifiable assumptions. In this paper, we present $\mathcal{L}_1$ distributionally robust adaptive control ($\mathcal{L}_1$-DRAC): a control methodology for uncertain stochastic processes that guarantees robustness certificates in terms of uniform (finite-time) and maximal distributional deviation. We leverage the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control methodology to ensure the existence of Wasserstein ambiguity set around a nominal distribution, which is guaranteed to contain the true distribution. The uniform ambiguity set produces an ambiguity tube of distributions centered on the nominal temporally-varying nominal distribution. The designed controller generates the ambiguity tube in response to both epistemic (model uncertainties) and aleatoric (inherent randomness and disturbances) uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Diagnosability and Active Fault Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fault identification in discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to additive Gaussian white noise. We introduce a Bayesian framework that explicitly accounts for unmodeled faults under reasonable assumptions. Our approach hinges on a new quantitative diagnosability definition, revealing when passive fault identification (FID) is fundamentally limited by the given control sequence. To overcome such limitations, we propose an active FID strategy that designs control inputs for better fault identification. Numerical studies on a two-water tank system and a Mars satellite with complex and discontinuous dynamics demonstrate that our method significantly reduces failure rates with shorter identification delays compared to purely passive techniques.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Pinching-Antenna-Enabled Internet of Things Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna systems (PASS), which activate small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide, has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for flexible antenna deployment in next-generation wireless communication networks. While most existing studies assume rectangular indoor layouts with full coverage waveguide, practical deployments may involve geometric constraints, partial coverage, and non-negligible waveguide attenuation. This paper presents the first analytical investigation of PASS in a circular indoor environment, encompassing both full coverage and partial coverage waveguide configurations with/without propagation loss. A unified geometric-propagation framework is developed that jointly captures pinching-antenna placement, Internet of Things (IoT) device location distribution, and waveguide attenuation. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average achievable rate are derived for four scenarios, with accuracy validated via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The analysis reveals that, under the partial coverage waveguide scenario with propagation loss, the system performance demonstrates a non-monotonic trend with respect to the waveguide length, and the optimal length decreases as the attenuation coefficient increases. Numerical results further quantify the interplay between deployment strategy, waveguide propagation loss, and coverage geometry, offering practical guidelines for performance-oriented PASS design.</description>

      <title>Estimating Cellular Network Delays in Finnish Railways: A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in using public cellular networks for specialized communication applications, replacing standalone sector-specific networks. One such application is transitioning from the aging GSM-R railway network to public 4G and 5G networks. Finland is modernizing its railway communication system through the Digirail project, leveraging public cellular networks. To evaluate network performance, a nationwide measurement campaign was conducted in two modes: Best Quality and Packet Replication. However, Best Quality mode introduces artificial delays, making it unsuitable for real-world assessments. In this paper, railway network delays are modeled using machine learning based on measurements from the Packet Replication mode. The best-performing model is then employed to generate a dataset estimating network delays across Finland's railway network. This dataset provides a more accurate representation of network performance. Machine learning based network performance prediction is shown to be feasible, and the results indicate that Finland's public cellular network can meet the stringent performance requirements of railway network control.</description>

      <title>StimulHeat: a Low-Energy Wearable Thermal Feedback Device Using Peltier Elements with Heat Flow Controlled Loop for Hand Interactions in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the majority of wearable thermal feedback systems designed for use in virtual reality applications are not compatible or not integrated to standard controllers and are based on temperature control. The objectives of the present work is to enable integration with existing controllers, in this case Valve Index controllers, and to propose an alternative approach to managing thermal stimulation with Peltier modules by controlling heat flow instead of temperature. We introduce StimulHeat as a wireless, low power thermal feedback system, based on the continuous relationship between heat and current injection in thermoelectric device (TED). First, we designed an optimized TED driver capable of injecting a continuous, bidirectional current into the TED, thereby driving it as a heater or cooler. Subsequently, this driver was implemented in an electronic board to include temperature and heat flow control loops, as well as Bluetooth Low Energy interface for remote control. A mechanical integration was conducted, in the form of a controller extension which is non-intrusive and can be clipped to Valve Index controllers to enclose the TED, temperature sensors and electronics. Finally, we present a user study validating StimulHeat for use in Virtual Reality, utilizing a Unity-built virtual environment with our open-source package.</description>

      <title>Model predictive quantum control: A modular approach for efficient and robust quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful modern control methods. It relies on repeatedly solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem and applying the beginning piece of the optimal input. In this paper, we develop a modular framework for improving efficiency and robustness of quantum optimal control (QOC) via MPC. We first provide a tutorial introduction to basic concepts of MPC from a QOC perspective. We then present multiple MPC schemes, ranging from simple approaches to more sophisticated schemes which admit stability guarantees. This yields a modular framework which can be used 1) to improve efficiency of open-loop QOC and 2) to improve robustness of closed-loop quantum control by incorporating feedback. We demonstrate these benefits with numerical results, where we benchmark the proposed methods against competing approaches.</description>

      <title>Feedback Linearisation with State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback Linearisation (FBL) is a widely used technique that applies feedback laws to transform input-affine nonlinear dynamical systems into linear dynamical systems, allowing for the use of linear controller design methods such as pole placement. However, for problems with state constraints, controlling the linear system induced by FBL can be more challenging than controlling the original system. This is because simple state constraints in the original nonlinear system become complex nonlinear constraints in the FBL induced linearised system, thereby diminishing the advantages of linearisation. To avoid increasing the complexity of state constraints under FBL, this paper introduces a method to first augment system dynamics to capture state constraints before applying FBL. We show that our proposed augmentation method leads to ill-defined relative degrees at state constraint boundaries. However, we show that ill-defined relative degrees can be overcome by using a switching FBL controller. Numerical experiments illustrate the capabilities of this method for handling state constraints within the FBL framework.</description>

      <title>Palladium-Coated Laterally Vibrating Resonators (LVRs) for Hydrogen Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel hydrogen sensor based on 30% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (ScAlN) laterally vibrating resonators (LVRs) functionalized with a palladium (Pd) thin film. The micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device operates by detecting shifts in resonant frequency resulting from hydrogen absorption in the Pd layer. The sensor demonstrates a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 820, an electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2) of 3.18%, and an enhanced responsivity of 26 Hz/ppm in the low-parts per million (ppm) range, making it highly suitable for hydrogen leak detection. Compared to existing MHz-range technologies, the sensor achieves up to 50x higher sensitivity, while also offering multi-frequency definition in a single lithographic step, minimal footprint, and the highest quality factor among comparable miniaturized platforms.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Intelligent Traffic Surveillance System: Real-Time Vehicle Detection, Classification, Tracking, and Behavioral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of 90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling, vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics. Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware, infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation smart cities.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Sub-optimal Policies for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from demonstration-based guidance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Damping for the 1D Wave Equation Using a Single Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04817v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational structures are susceptible to catastrophic failures or structural damages when external forces induce resonances or repeated unwanted oscillations. One common mitigation strategy is to use dampers to suppress these disturbances. This leads to the problem of finding optimal damper viscosities and positions for a given vibrational structure. Although extensive research exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper positions remains challenging due to its discrete nature. To overcome this, we introduce a novel model for the damped wave equation (at the PDE level) with a damper of viscosity $\mathfrak{g}$ at position $\mathfrak{p}$ and develop a system-theoretic input/output-based analysis in the frequency domain. In this system-theoretic formulation, while we consider average displacement as the output, for input (forcing), we analyze two separate cases, namely, the uniform and boundary forcing. For both cases, explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding transfer functions, parametrized by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. This explicit parametrization by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ facilitates analyzing the optimal damping problem (at the PDE level) using norms such as the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norms. We also examine limiting cases, such as when the viscosity is very large or when no external damping is present. To illustrate our approach, we present numerical examples, compare different optimization criteria, and discuss the impact of damping parameters on the damped wave equation.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making dynamics in hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes a collective decision-making dynamical process in a multiagent system under the assumption of cooperative higher-order interactions within the community, modeled as a hypernetwork. The nonlinear interconnected system is characterized by saturated nonlinearities that describe how agents transmit their opinion state to their neighbors in the hypernetwork, and by a bifurcation parameter representing the community's social effort. We show that the presence of higher-order interactions leads to the unfolding of a pitchfork bifurcation, introducing an interval for the social effort parameter in which the system exhibits bistability. With equilibrium points representing collective decisions, this implies that, depending on the initial conditions, the community will either remain in a deadlock state (with the origin as the equilibrium point) or reach a nontrivial decision. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control Design for Autonomous Vehicles with Perception-based Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased, heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.</description>

      <title>A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Interpretable Cyberattack Detection in AGC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems, considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis for Stochastic Hybrid Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic hybrid inclusions (SHIs) address situations with the stochastic continuous evolution in a stochastic differential inclusions and random jumps in the difference inclusions due to the forced (the state reaching a boundary in the state space) and/or spontaneous (the state vector may occur spontaneously) transitions. An obvious characteristic of SHIs is the non-uniqueness of random solutions, which can be ensured by the mild regularity conditions, as well as nominal robustness. Basic sufficient conditions for stability/recurrence in probability are usually expressed based on different types of Lyapunov functions, including Lagrange/Lyapunov/Lyapunov-Forster functions respectively for Lagrange/Lyapunov/asymptotical stability in probability and Foster/Lagrange-Forster functions for recurrence, (weaker) relaxed Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions including Matrosov-Foster functions and the stochastic invariance principle, as well as Lyapunov-based necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotical stability in probability or recurrence (i.e.,converse theorems), etc. The converse theorems involving smooth Lyapunov functions are guaranteed by the sequential compactness and thus robustness. In addition, the uniformity property and causality are analyzed for the stabilities in probability. Hence, serving as a partial roadmap for the theoretical development of SHIs, also serving as inspiration, we anticipate that many of the open questions, including the prediction problem, the filtering problem and the control problem, will be resolved based on the techniques of SHIs.</description>

      <title>Attitude Control of Rigid Bodies: A Survey of Representations, Topological Obstructions, and Stabilization Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews the attitude control problems for rigid-body systems, starting from the attitude representation for rigid body kinematics. Highly redundant rotation matrix defines the attitude orientation globally and uniquely by 9 parameters, which is the most fundamental one, without any singularities; minimum 3-parameter Euler angles or (modified) Rodrigues parameters define the attitude orientation neither globally nor uniquely, but the former exhibits kinematical singularity and Gimbal lock, while the latter two exhibit geometrical singularity; once-redundant axis-angle or unit quaternion globally define the attitude rotation but not uniquely using 4 parameters, but the former is not appropriate to define very small or very large rotations, while the latter shows unwinding phenomenon despite of the reduced computation burden. In addition, we explore the relationships among those attitude representations, including the connections among Gimbal lock, unwinding phenomenon and a nowhere dense set of zero Lebesgue measure. Based on attitude representations, we analyze different attitude control laws, almost global control and global attitude control, nominal and general robustness, as well as the technique tools.</description>

      <title>Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>NISE-PE Constraint: Data-Driven Predictive Control with Persistence of Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistence of excitation (PE) is an important requirement for the successful operation of data-driven predictive control, as it ensures that the input-output data contains sufficient information about the underlying system dynamics. Nonetheless, this property is usually assumed rather than guaranteed. This paper introduces a novel data-driven predictive control formulation that maintains PE. The technical development that allows this is the characterisation of the nonexciting input set (NIS), i.e., the set of inputs that lead to loss of PE, and the consequent derivation of a pair of disjoint, linear inequality constraints on the input, termed NIS exclusion PE (NIS-PE) constraint, that, if satisfied, maintain PE. When used in a predictive control formulation, these constraints lead to a mixed-integer optimal control problem with a single binary variable or, equivalently, a pair of disjoint quadratic programming problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved. Numerical examples show how these constraints are able to maintain PE during the controller's operation, resulting in improved performance over conventional approaches for both time-invariant and time-varying systems.</description>

      <title>InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy widely utilized in domains like energy management, building control, and autonomous systems. However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose InstructMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution (L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, InstructMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a tailored loss function.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning linear dynamical systems from noisy observations. In this setting, existing algorithms either yield biased parameter estimates or have large sample complexities. We resolve these issues by adapting the instrumental variable method and the bias compensation method, originally proposed for error-in-variables models, to our setting. We provide refined non-asymptotic analysis for both methods. Under mild conditions, our algorithms achieve superior sample complexities that match the best-known sample complexity for learning a fully observable system without observation noise.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Parameters in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication. The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other, thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact consensus of the state variables.</description>

      <title>Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Harpocrates: A Statically Typed Privacy Conscious Pro-gramming Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.</description>

      <title>Teleoperation of Continuum Instruments: Task-Priority Analysis of Linear Angular Command Interplay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion (RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard surgical kit.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP</title>

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</description>
