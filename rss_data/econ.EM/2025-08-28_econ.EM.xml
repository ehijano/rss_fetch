      <title>A further look at Modified ML estimation of the panel AR(1) model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two kinds of generalizations of Lancaster's (Review of Economic Studies, 2002) Modified ML estimator (MMLE) for the panel AR(1) model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions and possibly covariates when the time dimension, T, is fixed. When the autoregressive parameter rho=1, the limiting modified profile log-likelihood function for this model has a stationary point of inflection, and rho is first-order underidentified but second-order identified. We show that the generalized MMLEs exist w.p.a.1. and are uniquely defined w.p.1. and consistent for any value of |rho| =&lt; 1. When rho=1, the rate of convergence of the MMLEs is N^{1/4}, where N is the cross-sectional dimension of the panel. We then develop an asymptotic theory for GMM estimators when one of the parameters is only second-order identified and use this to derive the limiting distributions of the MMLEs. They are generally asymmetric when rho=1. We also show that Quasi LM tests that are based on the modified profile log-likelihood and use its expected rather than observed Hessian, with an additional modification for rho=1, and confidence regions based on inverting these tests have correct asymptotic size in a uniform sense when |rho| =&lt; 1. Finally, we investigate the finite sample properties of the MMLEs and the QLM test in a Monte Carlo study.</description>

      <title>Time Series Embedding and Combination of Forecasts: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecasting combination puzzle is a well-known phenomenon in forecasting literature, stressing the challenge of outperforming the simple average when aggregating forecasts from diverse methods. This study proposes a Reinforcement Learning - based framework as a dynamic model selection approach to address this puzzle. Our framework is evaluated through extensive forecasting exercises using simulated and real data. Specifically, we analyze the M4 Competition dataset and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). This research introduces an adaptable methodology for selecting and combining forecasts under uncertainty, offering a promising advancement in resolving the forecasting combination puzzle.</description>

      <title>Uniform Quasi ML based inference for the panel AR(1) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes new inference methods for panel AR models with arbitrary initial conditions and heteroskedasticity and possibly additional regressors that are robust to the strength of identification. Specifically, we consider several Maximum Likelihood based methods of constructing tests and confidence sets (CSs) and show that (Quasi) LM tests and CSs that use the expected Hessian rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood have correct asymptotic size (in a uniform sense). We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects version of such a LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with the maximal attainable power curve in the worst case setting. We also study the empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and CSs.</description>

      <title>Large sample properties of GMM estimators under second-order identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13475</link>

Abstract: Dovonon and Hall (Journal of Econometrics, 2018) proposed a limiting distribution theory for GMM estimators for a p - dimensional globally identified parameter vector {\phi} when local identification conditions fail at first-order but hold at second-order. They assumed that the first-order underidentification is due to the expected Jacobian having rank p-1 at the true value {\phi}_{0}, i.e., having a rank deficiency of one. After reparametrizing the model such that the last column of the Jacobian vanishes, they showed that the GMM estimator of the first p-1 parameters converges at rate T^{-1/2} and the GMM estimator of the remaining parameter, {\phi}_{p}, converges at rate T^{-1/4}. They also provided a limiting distribution of T^{1/4}({\phi}_{p}-{\phi}_{0,p}) subject to a (non-transparent) condition which they claimed to be not restrictive in general. However, as we show in this paper, their condition is in fact only satisfied when {\phi} is overidentified and the limiting distribution of T^{1/4}({\phi}_{p}-{\phi}_{0,p}), which is non-standard, depends on whether {\phi} is exactly identified or overidentified. In particular, the limiting distributions of the sign of T^{1/4}({\phi}_{p}-{\phi}_{0,p}) for the cases of exact and overidentification, respectively, are different and are obtained by using expansions of the GMM objective function of different orders. Unsurprisingly, we find that the limiting distribution theories of Dovonon and Hall (2018) for Indirect Inference (II) estimation under two different scenarios with second-order identification where the target function is a GMM estimator of the auxiliary parameter vector, are incomplete for similar reasons. We discuss how our results for GMM estimation can be used to complete both theories and how they can be used to obtain the limiting distributions of the II estimators in the case of exact identification under either scenario.</description>
