      <title>On Tree Automata, Generating Functions, and Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce holonomic tree automata: a common extension of weighted tree automata and holonomic recurrences. We show that the generating function of the tree series represented by such an automaton is differentially algebraic. Conversely, we give an algorithm that inputs a differentially algebraic power series, represented as a solution of a rational dynamical system, and outputs an automaton whose generating function is the given series. Such an automaton yields a recurrence that can be used to compute the terms of the power series. We use the algorithm to obtain automaton representations of exponential generating functions of families of combinatorial objects given as combinatorial species. Using techniques from differential algebra, we show that it is decidable both whether two automata represent the same formal tree series and whether they have the same generating function.</description>

      <title>Provably Good Solutions to the Knapsack Problem via Neural Networks of Bounded Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.14105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical understanding of the performance of neural networks is a major challenge in artificial intelligence. Against this background, we study the expressive power of neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem. Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least $1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized to many other combinatorial optimization problems that admit dynamic programming solution methods, such as various Shortest Path Problems, the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, and the Traveling Salesperson Problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence via Stability and Applications to Holant-Type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper formalizes connections between stability of polynomials and convergence rates of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We prove that if a (multivariate) partition function is nonzero in a region around a real point $\lambda$ then spectral independence holds at $\lambda$. As a consequence, for Holant-type problems (e.g., spin systems) on bounded-degree graphs, we obtain optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing time bounds for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics. Our result significantly improves the running time guarantees obtained via the polynomial interpolation method of Barvinok (2017), refined by Patel and Regts (2017).
  There are a variety of applications of our results. In this paper, we focus on Holant-type (i.e., edge-coloring) problems, including weighted edge covers and weighted even subgraphs. For the weighted edge cover problem (and several natural generalizations) we obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm on bounded-degree graphs. The even subgraphs problem corresponds to the high-temperature expansion of the ferromagnetic Ising model. We obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Ising model with a nonzero external field on bounded-degree graphs, which improves upon the classical result of Jerrum and Sinclair (1993) for this class of graphs. We obtain further applications to antiferromagnetic two-spin models on line graphs, weighted graph homomorphisms, tensor networks, and more.</description>

      <title>Finding cliques and dense subgraphs using edge queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a large clique in an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph where we are allowed unbounded computational time but can only query a limited number of edges. Recall that the largest clique in $G \sim G(n,1/2)$ has size roughly $2\log_{2} n$. Let $\alpha_{\star}(\delta,\ell)$ be the supremum over $\alpha$ such that there exists an algorithm that makes $n^{\delta}$ queries in total to the adjacency matrix of $G$, in a constant $\ell$ number of rounds, and outputs a clique of size $\alpha \log_{2} n$ with high probability. We give improved upper bounds on $\alpha_{\star}(\delta,\ell)$ for every $\delta \in [1,2)$ and $\ell \geq 3$. We also study analogous questions for finding subgraphs with density at least $\eta$ for a given $\eta$, and prove corresponding impossibility results.</description>

      <title>Signed combinatorial interpretations in algebraic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of signed combinatorial interpretations for several large families of structure constants. These families include standard bases of symmetric and quasisymmetric polynomials, as well as various bases in Schubert theory. The results are stated in the language of computational complexity, while the proofs are based on the effective M\"obius inversion.</description>
