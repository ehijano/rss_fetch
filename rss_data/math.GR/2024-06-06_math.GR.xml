      <title>Root graded groups revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is called root graded if it has a family of subgroups $G_\alpha$ indexed by roots from a root system $\Phi$ satisfying natural conditions similar to Chevalley groups over commutative unital rings. For any such group there is a corresponding algebraic structure (commutative unital ring, associative unital ring, etc.) encoding the commutator relations between $G_\alpha$. We give a complete description of varieties of such structures for irreducible root systems of rank $\geq 3$ excluding $\mathsf H_3$ and $\mathsf H_4$. Moreover, we provide a construction of root graded groups for all algebraic structures from these varieties.</description>

      <title>Closures of permutation groups with restricted nonabelian composition factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G$ on a finite set $\Omega$, let $G^{(k)}$ denote the $k$-closure of $G$, that is, the largest permutation group on $\Omega$ having the same orbits in the induced action on $\Omega^k$ as $G$. Recall that a group is $\mathrm{Alt}(d)$-free if it does not contain a section isomorphic to the alternating group of degree $d$. Motivated by some problems in computational group theory, we prove that the $k$-closure of an $\mathrm{Alt}(d)$-free group is again $\mathrm{Alt}(d)$-free for $k \geq 4$ and $d \geq 25$.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Separability of Baumslag--Solitar groups and Their Generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $\Gamma$ has separable cohomology if the profinite completion map $\iota \colon \Gamma \to \widehat{\Gamma}$ induces an isomorphism on cohomology with finite coefficient modules. In this article, cohomological separability is decided within the class of generalised Baumslag--Solitar groups, i.e. graphs of groups with infinite cyclic fibers. Equivalent conditions are given both explicitly in terms of the defining graph of groups and in terms of the induced topology on vertex groups. Restricted to the class of Baumslag--Solitar groups, we obtain a trichotomy of cohomological separability and cohomological dimension of the profinite completions. In particular, this yields examples of non-residually-finite one-relator groups which have separable cohomology, and examples which do not.</description>

      <title>Classification of generalized torsion elements of order two in 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $g$ a non-trivial element in $G$. If some non-empty finite product of conjugates of $g$ equals to the identity, then $g$ is called a generalized torsion element. The minimum number of conjugates in such a product is called the order of $g$. We will classify $3$-manifolds $M$, each of whose fundamental group has a generalized torsion element of order two. Furthermore, we will classify such elements in $\pi_1(M)$. We also prove that $R$-group and $\overline{R}$-group coincide for $3$-manifold groups, and classify $3$-manifold groups which are $R$-groups (and hence $\overline{R}$-groups).</description>

      <title>The spanning number and the independence number of a subset of an abelian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_m\}$ be a subset of a finite abelian group $G$. We call $A$ {\it $t$-independent} in $G$, if whenever $$\lambda_1a_1+\lambda_2a_2+\cdots +\lambda_m a_m=0$$ for some integers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots , \lambda_m$ with $$|\lambda_1|+|\lambda_2|+\cdots +|\lambda_m| \leq t,$$ we have $\lambda_1=\lambda_2= \cdots = \lambda_m=0$, and we say that $A$ is {\it $s$-spanning} in $G$, if every element $g$ of $G$ can be written as $$g=\lambda_1a_1+\lambda_2a_2+\cdots +\lambda_m a_m$$ for some integers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots , \lambda_m$ with $$|\lambda_1|+|\lambda_2|+\cdots +|\lambda_m| \leq s.$$ In this paper we give an upper bound for the size of a $t$-independent set and a lower bound for the size of an $s$-spanning set in $G$, and determine some cases when this extremal size occurs. We also discuss an interesting connection to spherical combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Galois extensions of number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field. We provide an asymptotic formula for the number of Galois extensions of $k$ with absolute discriminant bounded by some $X \geq 1$, as $X\to\infty$. We also provide an asymptotic formula for the closely related count of extensions $K/k$ whose normal closure has discriminant bounded by $X$. The key behind these results is a new upper bound on the number of Galois extensions of $k$ with a given Galois group $G$ and discriminant bounded by $X$; we show the number of such extensions is $O_{[k:\mathbb{Q}],G} (X^{ \frac{4}{\sqrt{|G|}}})$. This improves over the previous best bound $O_{k,G,\epsilon}(X^{\frac{3}{8}+\epsilon})$ due to Ellenberg and Venkatesh. In particular, ours is the first bound for general $G$ with an exponent that decays as $|G| \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $s$ be a positive integer. Our goal is to find all finite abelian groups $G$ that contain a $2$-subset $A$ for which the undirected Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,A)$ has diameter at most $s$. We provide a complete answer when $G$ is cyclic, and a conjecture and some partial answers when $G$ is noncyclic.</description>

      <title>Realizability of Subgroups by Subshifts of Finite Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of realizing families of subgroups as the set of stabilizers of configurations from a subshift of finite type (SFT). This problem generalizes both the existence of strongly and weakly aperiodic SFTs. We show that a finitely generated normal subgroup is realizable if and only if the quotient by the subgroup admits a strongly aperiodic SFT. We also show that if a subgroup is realizable, its subgroup membership problem must be decidable. The article also contains the introduction of periodically rigid groups, which are groups for which every weakly aperiodic subshift of finite type is strongly aperiodic. We conjecture that the only finitely generated periodically rigid groups are virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ groups and torsion-free virtually $\mathbb{Z}^2$ groups. Finally, we show virtually nilpotent and polycyclic groups satisfy the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Invariant quasimorphisms and generalized mixed Bavard duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of the celebrated duality theorem of Bavard and three its strengthenings. The Bavard duality theorem connects scl (stable commutator length) and quasimorphisms on a group. Calegari extended the framework from a group element to a chain on the group, and established the generalized Bavard duality. Kawasaki, Kimura, Matsushita and Mimura studied the setting of a pair of a group and its normal subgroup, and obtained the mixed Bavard duality. The first half of the present article is devoted to an introduction to these three Bavard dualities. In the latter half, we present a new strengthening, the generalized mixed Bavard duality, and provide a self-contained proof of it. This third strengthening recovers all of the Bavard dualities treated in the first half; thus, we supply complete proofs of these four Bavard dualities in a unified manner. In addition, we state several results on the space $\mathrm{W}(G,N)$ of non-extendable quasimorphisms, which is related to the comparison problem between scl and mixed scl via the mixed Bavard duality.</description>

      <title>A Cayley graph for $F_{2}\times F_{2}$ which is not minimally almost convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.00101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an example of a Cayley graph $\Gamma$ for the group $F_{2}\times F_{2}$ which is not minimally almost convex (MAC). On the other hand, the standard Cayley graph for $F_{2}\times F_{2}$ does satisfy the falsification by fellow traveler property (FFTP), which is strictly stronger. As a result, any Cayley graph property $K$ lying between FFTP and MAC (i.e., $\text{FFTP}\Rightarrow K\Rightarrow\text{MAC}$) is dependent on the generating set. This includes the well known properties FFTP and almost convexity, which were already known to depend on the generating set as well as Po\'{e}naru's condition $P(2)$ and the basepoint loop shortening property for which dependence on the generating set was previously unknown. We also show that the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ does not have the loop shortening property, so this property also depends on the generating set.</description>

      <title>Computable analysis on the space of marked groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01179v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate decision problems for finitely generated groups described by word problem algorithms. This is equivalent to studying groups described by computable labelled Cayley graphs. We relate these problems to the study of computable analysis on the space of marked groups, and point out several results of computable analysis that can be directly applied to obtain group theoretical results. Those results, used in conjunction with the version of Higman's Embedding Theorem that preserves solvability of the word problem, provide powerful tools to build finitely presented groups with solvable word problem but with various undecidable properties. Interestingly, the only results of computable analysis that can be applied together with Higman's Embedding Theorem are those of what is known as ``Markov's school of computable analysis''. We thus focus on articles which predate most of what is seen as the modern corpus of research in computable analysis. The presented results show that these older results are still very relevant. We also place group properties in the first levels of the arithmetical hierarchy for decision problems about groups given by word problem algorithms, and show that on many group properties usually considered, this effective hierarchy corresponds sharply to the Borel hierarchy. Finally, we prove that the space of marked groups is a Polish space that is not \emph{effectively Polish}. Because of this, many of the most important results of Markovian computable analysis cannot be applied to the space of marked groups. This includes the Kreisel-Lacombe-Schoenfield-Ceitin Theorem and a theorem of Moschovakis. The space of marked groups constitutes the first natural example of a Polish space that is not effectively Polish.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\pi$ be a set of primes. The aim of this paper is to obtain some results concerning how much information about the $\pi$-structure of $G$ can be gathered from the knowledge of the lengths of conjugacy classes of its $\pi$-elements and of their multiplicities. Among other results, we prove that this multiset of class lengths determine whether $G$ has a hypercentral Hall $\pi$-subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rota--Baxter operators over groups have been recently defined in \cite{LHY2021}, and they share a close connection with skew braces, as demonstrated in \cite{VV2022}. In this paper, we classify all Rota--Baxter operators of weight 1 over the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension 3 by directly solving the operators defining equations. Using the fact that the exponential map from the Heisenberg Lie algebra to the Heisenberg Group is bijective, we induces these operators to the Heisenberg Group. Finally, we enumerate all skew left brace structures over the Heisenberg Group induced by these Rota--Baxter operators.</description>
