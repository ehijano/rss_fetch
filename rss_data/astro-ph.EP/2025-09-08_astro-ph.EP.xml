      <title>A carbon-rich atmosphere on a windy pulsar planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of "black widow" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>The Evolution and Internal Structure of Neptunes and Sub-Neptunes: The importance of thermal conductivity in non-convective regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neptunes and sub-Neptunes are typically modeled under the assumption that the interior is adiabatic and consists of distinct layers. However, formation models indicate that composition gradients can exist. Such composition gradients can significantly affect the planetary thermal evolution. In non-convective layers, the heat transport is governed by multiple processes. We investigate how the evolution and internal structure of Neptunes and sub-Neptunes is affected when considering non-convective layers and the sensitivity of the results on the assumed thermal conductivity. Methods. We simulate the planetary evolution by considering thermal transport via radiation, electrons, and vibrational conductivity. We consider planetary masses of 5, 10 and 15 ME, three different initial energy budgets, and two different primordial composition profiles. We find that the assumed conductivity significantly affects the planetary thermal evolution. We show that the commonly used conductivity assumption is inappropriate for modeling this planetary type. Furthermore, we find that the inferred radii deviate by ~20% depending on the assumed conductivity. The uncertainty on the primordial entropy in planets with non-convective layers leads to a difference of ~25% in the radii. This shows that the theoretical uncertainties are significantly larger than the observed ones, and emphasizes the importance of these parameters. We conclude that the characterization and modeling of intermediate-mass gaseous planets strongly depend on the modeling approach and the model assumptions. We demonstrate that the existence of composition gradients significantly affects the inferred radius. We suggest that more data on thermal conductivities, particularly for partially ionized material and mixtures, as well as better constraints on the primordial thermal state of such planets are necessary.</description>

      <title>Granulation on a quiet K dwarf: HD 166620 I. Spectral signatures as a function of line-formation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Radial velocity (RV) spectrographs reach unprecedented precision and stability below 1 m/s, the challenge of granulation in the context of exoplanet detection has intensified. Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.</description>

      <title>Kete: Predicting Known Minor Bodies in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kete is an open-source software package for quickly and accurately predicting the positions and magnitudes of asteroids and comets in large-scale, all-sky surveys. It can predict observable objects for any ground or space-based telescope. Kete contains a collection of tools, including simple optical and thermal modeling, $n$-body orbit calculations, and custom multi-threaded SPICE kernel support. It can be used for observation planning, pre-discovery of detections at a large scale, and labeling known solar system objects in images. Here we demonstrate some of the capabilities by predicting all observations of every numbered asteroid seen by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) surveys during single years of their operations, predicting locations and magnitudes of 756,999 asteroids in over 11 million images.</description>

      <title>Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning: A CNN and RNN Classifier for Kepler DR25 and Candidate Vetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler, TESS, and the upcoming PLATO mission has generated massive light-curve datasets that challenge traditional vetting pipelines. We introduce a hybrid deep-learning framework that integrates convolutional networks, bidirectional LSTMs, and an attention mechanism to identify planetary transit signals with improved accuracy and interpretability. Trained on Kepler DR25 data, the model achieves F1 = $0.910 \pm 0.008$ (AUC--ROC = $0.984 \pm 0.004$), significantly outperforming CNN-only baselines. Attention-based visualizations highlight ingress and egress phases consistent with astrophysical expectations. Applied to 1,360 DR25 candidate dispositions, our pipeline identified 190 high-confidence signals (P(model) $&lt;$ 0.70) that passed initial validation. Following comprehensive false positive probability (FPP) analysis and contamination tests, 13 candidates achieved statistical validation, of which three were fully confirmed as robust exoplanets: KOI-901.01 (warm mini-Neptune), KOI-1066.01 (hot Jupiter), and KOI-212.01 (warm Neptune). With an inference time of $\sim 80$ ms per candidate, this framework enables scalable real-time triage for TESS and future PLATO operations, while the validated candidates provide a prioritized list for radial velocity, timing, and atmospheric follow-up. This interpretable, efficient pipeline addresses the bottleneck in exoplanet confirmation, advancing scalable discovery in the era of large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Assessing the feasibility range of Solar-powered Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work aims to assess principal physical technical constraints of the key technological concept for achieving maximal carrying capacity expansive potential of Planetary Systems. Chemical composition of most potential Biosphere Substrates is in most cases very far from optimal for full-scale habitability thus productivity potential realization. To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher. The farther planetesimal is orbiting from a star the more time but less energy is required for its delivery. The more distant from a star, the more rich in volatiles planetesimals are. The most technically detailed and feasible scheme to date of Planetesimals Redirection was proposed in 1993 by Dr. Zubrin based on NTRs. Nuclear fuel is extremely scarce and might be the principal limiting factor for final stages of interstellar colonization missions. We investigate possibilities of using concentrated beamed solar power Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming as it can increase the possible scale of such operations to orders of magnitude. Such a mission might consist of Planetesimal Tug Spacecraft Systems (PTSS) to redirect a planetesimal, and solar Power Harvesting Beaming System (PHBS) tracking the spacecraft with a beam to power it. We found Solarpowered Planetesimals Redirection for Terraforming is feasible within Kuiper Belt with present technologies.</description>

      <title>Biosphere Substrate and its parameters range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term Biosphere Substrate is introduced for celestial bodies, like terrestrial planets or big gas giant moons, suitable to sustain full-scale open biosphere after Terraforming. The purpose of the work is to examine the range of parameters for a biosphere substrate. Most importantly, Biosphere Substrate gravity should sustain full-scale open breathable atmosphere dense enough after Terraforming during the lifecycle of Planetary System. Humans can not reproduce in too low gravity, can not restore functionality after long exposure to microgravity. Extremely high gravity is also the limit for complex life forms functioning. Gravity is the main parameter that is the most difficult to change, thus the range of celestial object sizes fitting the Biosphere Substrate definition is examined first. The capability of a celestial body to retain breathable atmosphere during Planetary System lifecycle depends on planetary magnetic field strength, thus plate tectonics is necessary, sufficient satellite is needed for geodynamo. As chemical composition of Biosphere Substrate surface hydrosphere atmosphere can be drastically adjusted in most cases by importing planetesimas material, this factor in most cases does not determine whether a celestial body can become a Biosphere Substrate. But for water worlds where any solid material to build biological bodies and industrial structures can be more than thousand kilometers deep, chemical composition can become an issue. Temperature is another important parameter, as complex life can exist in rather narrow range. For a full-scale open biosphere development, there must be a sufficient source of power. A Biosphere Substrate orbit must be within technically extendable circumstellar habitable zone. For planets with solid crusts, their rotation thus daylength &amp; tilt can be adjusted by hitting asteroids and comets strictly tangentially with high velocities.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>TOI-1743 b, TOI-5799 b, TOI-5799 c and TOI-6223 b: TESS discovery and validation of four super-Earth to Neptune-sized planets around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery by the TESS mission of one transiting Neptune-sized planet, TOI-6223 b and two transiting super-Earths, TOI-1743 b and TOI-5799 b. We validate these planets using a statistical validation method, multi-color light curves and other ancillary observations. We combined TESS and ground-based photometric data to constrain the physical properties of the planets. TOI-6223-b is slightly larger than Neptune ($R_p=5.12^{+0.24}_{-0.25}$ $R_\oplus$) orbiting an early M dwarf in 3.86 days, and it has an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=714\pm14$ K. TOI-1743 b orbits its M4V star every 4.27 days. It has a radius of $R_p=1.83^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\oplus$ and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=485^{+14}_{-13}$ K. TOI-5799 b has a radius of $R_p=1.733^{+0.096}_{-0.090}$ $R_\oplus$, and an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=505\pm16$ K orbits an M2 dwarf in 4.17 days. We also present the discovery of an additional transiting planet, TOI-5799 c, that we identified in the TESS data and validated using the SHERLOCK pipeline. TOI-5799 c is a super-Earth with a radius of $R_p=1.76^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ $R_\oplus$. Its orbital period and its equilibrium temperature are 14.01 days and $T_{\rm eq}=337\pm11$ K, which place it near the inner edge of the habitable zone of its star.We show that these planets are suitable for both radial velocity follow-up and atmospheric characterization. They orbit bright (&lt; 11 $K_{mag}$) early M dwarfs, making them accessible for precise mass measurements. The combination of the planet sizes and stellar brightness of their host stars also make them suitable targets for atmospheric exploration with the JWST. Such studies may provide insights into planet formation and evolution, as TOI-1743-b, TOI-5799-b, and TOI-5799-c lie within the so-called radius valley, while TOI-6223-b is located on the Neptunian ridge in the period-radius plane.</description>

      <title>Extreme Negative Polarisation of New Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of the third discovered interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), obtained pre-perihelion with FORS2/VLT, ALFOSC/NOT, and FoReRo2/RCC, over a phase angle range of 7.7-22.4{\deg}. This marks the second ever polarimetric study of an interstellar object, the first distinguishing 2I/Borisov from most Solar System comets by its higher positive polarisation. Our polarimetric measurements as a function of phase angle reveal that 3I is characterised by an deep and narrow negative polarisation branch, reaching a minimum value of -2.7% at phase angle 7{\deg}, and an inversion angle of 17{\deg} -- a combination unprecedented among asteroids and comets, including 2I/Borisov. At very small phase angles, the extrapolated slope of the polarisation phase curve is consistent with that of certain small trans-Neptunian objects and Centaur Pholus, consistent with independent spectroscopic evidence for a red, possibly water-ice-bearing object. Imaging confirms a diffuse coma present from our earliest observations, though no strong polarimetric features are spatial resolved. These findings may demonstrate that 3I represents a distinct type of comet, expanding the diversity of known interstellar bodies.</description>

      <title>Using Cosmic Rays to Predict the Weather: Meteorological Data Assimilation of Atmospheric Muon Flux Data</title>

Abstract: Numerical weather prediction requires initial estimates of the atmospheric state. Since the atmospheric density field is intricately woven into the atmosphere's governing equations, advancing atmospheric density estimation will improve numerical weather prediction. However, current meteorological instrumentation cannot directly measure the atmospheric density field over large volumes. Existing techniques rely on sparse point measurements, limiting our ability to accurately estimate the three-dimensional atmospheric density field. One potential solution is to employ measurements of the atmospheric muon flux. Atmospheric muons are particles produced when energetic atomic nuclei (cosmic rays) collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing a shower of secondary particles (muons) that propagates to the Earth's surface. The surface atmospheric muon flux is known to be proportional to the local atmospheric density field, implying that this technique can be used as a measurement of atmospheric density. This study examines the potential for using atmospheric muon flux measurements to improve atmospheric state estimation via a case study of simulated atmospheric muon observations in the path of tropical cyclone Freddy. We show that improvement in data assimilation performance can be achieved using data from a relatively small astroparticle detector, well within the capabilities of existing astroparticle technology. We additionally show that the improvements to atmospheric state estimates associated with muon flux assimilation are at least partially unique to muon flux measurements, as comparable surface pressure point measurements do not reproduce a similar effect.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>The Variable Radio Emission of V830 Tau and Its Putative Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first moderate-length time-scale observations of a young stellar object (YSO) at microwave frequencies. V830 Tau was monitored over the course of eight days with the JVLA at a frequency range of 4-8 GHz. Previous brief radio observations of this purported planet-hosting star indicated a radio-bright source with sparse evidence of dramatic intensity changes. Our observations confirm variability larger than a factor of five over the 8 days, with closer-spaced data indicating a long-lived flare event spanning multiple days. We discuss a hypothesis that the large, long-duration radio flare may be produced as a result of magnetospheric interaction between the star and its purported planet, using multi-year monitoring of a few active binary systems with the Green Bank Interferometer to augment our discussion. Although we cannot disentangle the effect of the large stellar surface area from any effects of orbital separation, the disputed star-planet system would have a large amount of power generated from stretching and breaking of magnetic fields. If this long-duration flare behavior repeats with additional data on timescales close to the planetary orbital period, microwave signatures of interacting magnetospheres could be a new observational tool to confirm the existence of planets around young, magnetically active stars.</description>

      <title>Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semi-analytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. I. Orbital evolution due to conservative mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer (MT) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution. While MT in circular orbits is well studied, observations indicate that it also occurs in eccentric ones. To date, no framework simultaneously accounts for both conservative and non-conservative MT across arbitrary eccentricities while also incorporating the donor star`s spin. We present a new semi-analytic framework for the secular orbital evolution of mass-transferring binaries, treating stars as extended bodies and accounting for the donor star`s spin. The model is applicable to both circular and eccentric orbits and accommodates conservative and non-conservative MT across a broad range of mass ratios and stellar spins. We derive secular, orbit-averaged equations describing the orbital evolution by treating MT, mass loss, and angular momentum loss as perturbations to the general two-body problem. Assuming conservative MT, we compare our results to previous models and validate them against numerical integrations. Our model predicts stronger orbital widening at a given mass ratio than previous models. For circular orbits, we find that the transitional mass ratio $q_{trans,a}$, which separates orbital widening from shrinkage, increases from $q_{trans,a} = 1$ up to $q_{trans,a} \sim 1.5$ when accounting for extended bodies. For eccentric orbits, the model predicts a broader parameter space for both orbital widening and eccentricity pumping. We find that stable MT naturally explains the observed correlation between longer orbital periods and higher eccentricities, providing a robust mechanism for the formation of wide and eccentric post-interaction binaries. Our model can be integrated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to consistently treat conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrarily eccentric orbits with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to gravitational-wave progenitors.</description>

      <title>Water Production Rates of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of water activity in the third confirmed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, based on ultraviolet imaging with the \emph{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory}'s Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Assuming a reddening of 29\% between 3325.7~\AA\ and 5437.8~\AA, measurements on 2025 July 31 -- August 1 yielded a first, marginal detection of OH (A$^2\Sigma$ -- X$^2\Pi$) emission near 3085~\AA, corresponding to a water production rate of $(0.74 \pm 0.50) \times 10^{27}$ molecules\,s$^{-1}$. The subsequent visit on 2025 August 18 -- 20 revealed a clear OH detection, implying a higher water production rate of $(1.36 \pm 0.35) \times 10^{27}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ (40 kg~$s^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 2.90~au. This places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond 2.5~au, where water ice sublimation from the nucleus is typically inefficient. The inferred production rate at 2.9 au implies an active area of at least 7.8~km$^2$, assuming equilibrium sublimation. This requires that over 8\% of the surface is active, which is larger than activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous near-infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of icy grains in the coma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor.</description>

      <title>Statistical significance of meteorite-asteroid pairs using geocentric parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We will test the statistical significance of meteorite-dropping fireballs and NEA clustering using the DN similarity function based on four geocentric quantities (U, theta, phi, and lambda).
  Methods. We calculated the cumulative similarity found between 46 meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, 20,516 NEAs maintained by NEODyS-2, along with 34,836 NEAs maintained by NASA/JPL HORIZONS. Statistical significance was estimated by either: (1) Kernel Density Estimation-based method to estimate the sporadic background distribution to draw random samples, or (2) applying a uniform random solar longitude (lambda). Each comparison to the synthetic sporadic population is repeated to estimate the 3-sigma region for which the cumulative similarity distribution is consistent with random association levels.
  Results. The observed DN cumulative similarity distribution between 46 instrumentally observed meteorite falls, 535 potential meteorite-dropping fireballs, and over 30k NEAs radiants (estimated using 6 different radiant methods) reveals no statistically significant excess of similarity between the populations consistent with streams.
  Conclusions. Based on nearly 600 fireball observations, there is no statistically significant clustering between meteorite falls and NEAs using geocentric impact parameters. If some meteorites arrive in streams, they make up less than ~0.1% of all falls. Recent asteroid or meteoroid physical processes could still explain features found in meteorites, but this activity is not producing distinguishable orbital streams or pairs.</description>

      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Radius Valley Across Stellar Types: A Transit-Only Analysis of M, K, G, and F Stars with Updated NASA Exoplanet Archive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radius valley -- a deficit of exoplanets between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes -- is a key diagnostic of planet formation and atmospheric evolution. We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by analyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Planets are selected with $P &lt; 100$ days and divided by host spectral class (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply statistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley centered near $\sim 1.8\,R_\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\sim 1.6\,R_\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\sim 1.9\,R_\oplus$ for F stars. These results support the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent processes such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital migration.</description>
