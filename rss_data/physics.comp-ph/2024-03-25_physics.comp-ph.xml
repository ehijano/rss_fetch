      <title>Coherent Phonon Control of Ultrafast Magnetization Dynamics in Fe$_\text{3}$GeTe$_\text{2}$ from Time-Dependent Ab Initio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring ultrafast magnetization control in two-dimensional (2D) magnets through optically driven coherent phonons has been well-established. Yet, the microscopic interplay between spin dynamics and lattice degrees of freedom remains less explored. Employing real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) coupled with Ehrenfest dynamics, we systematically investigate laser-induced spin-nuclei dynamics with coherent phonon excitation in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. We found that selectively pre-exciting three typical coherent phonon modes results in up to a 53% additional spin moment loss in an out-of-plane A2 1g mode within ~50 fs. Coherent phonon control of spin dynamics is closely linked to laser pulse parameters. The underlying microscopic mechanism of this phenomenon is primarily governed by coherent phonon-induced asymmetric spin-resolved charge transfer following the disappearance of the laser pulse, thereby enabling effective control of the spin moment loss. Our findings offer a novel insight into the coupling of coherent phonons with spin systems in 2D limits on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Numerical Method for Modeling Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs) are wideband, ultralow-noise amplifiers used to enable the readout of superconducting qubits. While individual JTWPAs have achieved high performance, behavior between devices is inconsistent due to wide manufacturing tolerances. Amplifier designs could be modified to improve resilience towards variations in amplifier components; however, existing device models often rely on analytical techniques that typically fail to incorporate component variations. To begin addressing this issue, a 1D numerical method for modeling JTWPAs is introduced in this work. The method treats the Josephson junctions and transmission lines in an amplifier as coupled subsystems and can easily incorporate arbitrary parameter variations. We discretize the transmission line subsystem with a finite element time domain method and the Josephson junction subsystem with a finite difference method, with leapfrog time marching used to evolve the system in time. We validate our method by comparing the computed gain to an analytical model for a traditional JTWPA architecture and one with resonant phase matching. We then use our method to demonstrate the impact of variations in Josephson junctions and phase-matching resonators on amplification. In future work, the method will be adjusted to incorporate additional amplifier architectures and extended to a 3D full-wave approach.</description>

      <title>Neurophotonics beyond the Surface: Unmasking the Brain's Complexity Exploiting Optical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate nature of the brain necessitates the application of advanced probing techniques to comprehensively study and understand its working mechanisms. Neurophotonics offers minimally invasive methods to probe the brain using optics at cellular and even molecular levels. However, multiple challenges persist, especially concerning imaging depth, field of view, speed, and biocompatibility. A major hindrance to solving these challenges in optics is the scattering nature of the brain. This perspective highlights the potential of complex media optics, a specialized area of study focused on light propagation in materials with intricate heterogeneous optical properties, in advancing and improving neuronal readouts for structural imaging and optical recordings of neuronal activity. Key strategies include wavefront shaping techniques and computational imaging and sensing techniques that exploit scattering properties for enhanced performance. We discuss the potential merger of the two fields as well as potential challenges and perspectives toward longer term in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>A numerical framework for phoretic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical a framework to study phoretic particle dynamics in two dimensions. The particles are modeled as chemically active rigid circles, which can emit or absorb a solute into surrounding fluid. The interaction between particles and solute induces a slip flow on particle surfaces, and the solute is advected by the fluid flow and diffuses with a constant diffusivity. The fluid-structure interaction is resolved by a boundary integral method accelerated by Ewald-like decomposition. The sharp resolution of moving boundaries for solute kinetics is performed thanks to an overlapping mesh method. The framework is validated separately for the Stokes problem and the advection--diffusion problem, reaching relatively high order of accuracy. Moreover, we employ the framework to more general problems, including particles in nearly infinite domain and straight channels, and multiparticle motions.</description>

      <title>How Physics Students Develop Disciplinary Computational Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation has revolutionized science and is gradually making its way into science teaching and learning. However, we currently lack theoretical frameworks to make sense of how students learn to use computation as a disciplinary tool. In this study, we propose disciplinary computational literacy as a productive theoretical lens on this subject. This theoretical perspective views computation as a new type of literacy consisting of material, cognitive, and social elements. We argue that these elements will necessarily vary by discipline and use case studies of two pairs of students writing computational essays in an intermediate physics course to examine how disciplinary computational literacy looks and is built at an undergraduate level. Through these case studies we see the pairs leveraging the different elements of their computational literacy to both engage with and produce computational literature in their discipline, while also engaging in a process of epistemic negotiation between their interests, the course goals, available tools, and their basis of computational literacy. These cases show how computational literacy can highlight the ways in which scientific computing helps students build disciplinary understanding and also shows that computational essays, as a genre of computational literature, are a useful epistemic form for developing computational literacy.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann modeling of dense gas flows in curvilinear geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Enskog equation utilizing orthonormal vielbein fields, enabling the utilization of arbitrary coordinate systems to characterize spatial geometry. Additionally, we employ an adapted coordinate system in the momentum space, connected to the physical space through vielbeins. Within this framework, the momentum component perpendicular to a curved boundary can be treated as an independent one, facilitating the application of half-range Gauss-Hermite quadratures. We develop an appropriate finite-difference Lattice Boltzmann model and validate it against a DSMC-like particle-based method for solving the Enskog equation in curvilinear geometries. Our test scenarios include cylindrical Couette flow, cylindrical Fourier flow between coaxial cylinders, and spherical Fourier flow between concentric spheres. Excellent agreement between the two approaches is observed throughout the parameter range and curvature-specific effects are well captured.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we present an extension to TensorNet, a state-of-the-art equivariant Cartesian tensor neural network potential, allowing it to handle charged molecules and spin states without architectural changes or increased costs. By incorporating these attributes, we address input degeneracy issues, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy across diverse chemical systems.

      <title>Fast Exact Algorithm for Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>
