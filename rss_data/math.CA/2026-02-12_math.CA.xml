      <title>The generalized Duhamel principle for fully coupled systems of fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duhamel's principle reduces the Cauchy problem for an inhomogeneous partial differential equation to the corresponding homogeneous problem. In the fractional-order setting, the classical principle does not apply directly because fractional derivatives are nonlocal in time. Over the past two decades, several fractional analogues of Duhamel's principle have been developed to address this issue.
  In this paper, we establish a fractional version of Duhamel's principle for fully coupled systems of fractional differential-operator equations. The result provides a systematic reduction of inhomogeneous fractional problems to homogeneous ones while preserving the structure of the classical method. In the limit of integer-order derivatives, the formulation recovers the classical Duhamel principle and also reveals effects specific to coupled fractional systems, including those produced by coupled fractional impulses.</description>

      <title>Discrete equations from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper discrete equations are derived from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, including a new discrete equation which has ternary symmetry. There are two classes of rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, one expressed in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomials and the other in terms of the generalised Umemura polynomials, both of which can be expressed as Wronskians of Laguerre polynomials. Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials. It is known that there is nonuniqueness of some rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation. Pairs of nonunique rational solutions are used to derive distinct hierarchies of rational solutions which satisfy the same discrete equation.</description>

      <title>ImprovEvolve: Ask AlphaEvolve to Improve the Input Solution and Then Improvise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve, have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. In this article, we present ImprovEvolve, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLM-based evolutionary approaches such as AlphaEvolve. Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102.</description>

      <title>The Brascamp--Lieb inequality on compact Lie groups and its extinction on homogeneous Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Brascamp--Lieb inequalities on locally compact nonabelian groups and the Brascamp--Lieb constants $\mathbf{BL}(G, \boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{p})$ associated to a Brascamp--Lieb datum: locally compact groups $G$ and $G_j$, a family of homomorphisms $\sigma_j: G \to G_j$ and Lebesgue indices $p_j$. We focus on homogeneous Lie groups and compact Lie groups. For homogeneous Lie groups $G$, we show that the constant $\mathbf{BL}(G, \boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{p})$ is equal to the constant $\mathbf{BL}(\mathfrak{g}, \boldsymbol{\mathrm{d}\sigma}, \boldsymbol{p})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$ and $\mathrm{d}\sigma_j$ is the differential of $\sigma_j$. For Heisenberg-like groups $G$, we show that the only inequalities that can occur are multilinear H\"older inequalities. For compact Lie groups, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness of the constant $\mathbf{BL}(G, \boldsymbol{\sigma}, \boldsymbol{p})$ in terms of $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and $\boldsymbol{p}$ and find an explicit expression for the constant, similar to those found by Bennett and Jeong in the abelian case.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: The first order expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous derivation of the first order expansion of the motion of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field. In contrast to the derivations that can be found in the physics literature we solely assume throughout that the magnetic field is strong. In particular we do not need to make any structural assumptions on the particle motion, such as the gyroradius being small in comparison to the magnetic length scale. Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach. Our approach further justifies the utilisation of the guiding centre approximation at "bounce points" within magnetic mirrors, a situation which violates the usual assumptions which are made in the physics literature when deriving the guiding centre approximation.</description>

      <title>Rational Points in Hyperbolic Regions and Multiplicative Diophantine Approximation on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the convergence theory of multiplicative Diophantine approximation for all non-degenerate, smooth manifolds. We also settle said convergence theory for all affine subspaces satisfying a highly generic and essentially optimal Diophantine condition. This answers a question of Beresnevich and Velani from 2005, while simultaneously sharpening results of Kleinbock and Margulis on the strong extremality of non-degenerate manifolds, and of Kleinbock on the strong extremality of affine subspaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp variational estimates of Stein-Wainger type operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $n \geq 2$, we establish $L^p(\R^n)$ inequalities for the $r$-variations of Stein-Wainger type oscillatory integral operators with general phase functions. These inequalities closely related to Carleson's theorem are sharp, up to endpoints. In particular, when the phase function is chosen as $|t|^\A$ with $\A\in (0,1)$,
  our results provide an affirmative answer to a question posed in Guo-Roos-Yung (Anal. PDE, 2020). Furthermore, we obtain the restricted weak type estimates for endpoints in the specific case of homogeneous phase functions.</description>

      <title>Local level sets of the Takagi-van der Waerden function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Takagi-van der Waerden function, $$
  T_r(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\phi(r^n x)}{r^n} ,\quad x\in [0,1], \quad r \in \mathbb{Z}^+, $$ where $\phi(x)={\rm dist}(x,\mathbb{Z})$ represents the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. %We prove that for every even integer $r \geq 2$, the expected number of local level sets contained in the level set $L_r(y)$ is $1 + 1/r$, if $y$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over the range of $T_r$.
  Lagarias and Maddock [Level sets of the Takagi function: local level sets, \emph{Monatsh. Math.}, {\bf 166} (2012), No. 2, 201--238] introduced the notion of local level sets for the classical Takagi function $T_2$. They proved that if $y$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over the range of $T_2$, then the expected number of local level sets contained in the level set $L_2(y)$ equals $3/2$. We extend the study by defining an analogous concept of local level sets for all even integers $r$. Then we prove that, for every even integer $r\geq 2$, if $y$ is a random variable uniformly distributed, then the expected number of local level sets contained in the level set $L_r(y)$ equals $1 + 1/r$.</description>

      <title>Chirped Gaussians Have Maximal Frame Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\varphi(x)=e^{-\pi x^2}$ be the Gaussian and $h_{\lambda}(x)=e^{-\pi i\lambda x^2}$ be a chirp where $\lambda\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$ is a parameter. For $\gamma&gt;0$, let $\varphi_{\gamma}(x)=e^{-\pi\gamma^2x^2}$ be the dilated Gaussian, we prove that for any such $\lambda,\gamma$, the chirped Gaussian $h_{\lambda}\cdot \varphi_{\gamma}$ always has maximal frame set, i.e., its frame set consists of precisely all positive pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ with $\alpha\beta&lt;1$. The proof is by using fractional Fourier transform to establish maximality on certain product-convoluted (with chirps) Gaussians first, then reduce general single chirped cases to it. It follows that $\mathcal g(\varphi_{\gamma},Q\mathbb Z^2)$ is a frame for $Q\in\mathbb R^{2\times 2}$ if and only if $0&lt;|\det Q|&lt;1$. In addition, with the theta function we also show that the Zak transform $Z(h_{\lambda}\cdot\varphi_{\gamma})$ always has a unique simple zero at the center of the unit square.</description>

Abstract: We develop the notion of Wilf-Zeilberger seeds as a powerful framework for generating WZ-pairs and for lifting classical hypergeometric identities to the $q$-setting. As an application, we systematically obtain a large family of $q$-analogues of Ramanujan-type $1/\pi^k$ formulas, extending a literature previously limited to sporadic examples. While the majority of these $q$-analogues are modular, we also uncover several curious instances of mock modularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents explicit formulas for intertwining operators of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$ acting on tensor products of Verma modules. We express a first set of intertwining operators (the holographic operators) in terms of the little $q$-Jacobi polynomials, and we obtain for the dual set (the symmetry breaking operators) a $q$-deformation of the Rankin--Cohen operators. The Verma modules are realised on polynomial spaces and, interestingly, we find along the way the need to work with non-commuting variables. Explicit connections are given with the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U_q(sl_2)$ expressed with the $q$-Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general way to obtain Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities from Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities and provide numerous examples. We use the same heuristic to prove a discrete version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities for functions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These are the functional extensions of the discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality conjectured by Ruzsa and recently established by Keevash, Tiba, and the author.</description>
