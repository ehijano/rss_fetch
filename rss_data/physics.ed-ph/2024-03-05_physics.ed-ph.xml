      <title>Training Computer Scientists for the Challenges of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we enter the post-Moore era, we experience the rise of various non-von-Neumann-architectures to address the increasing computational demand for modern applications, with quantum computing being among the most prominent and promising technologies. However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.</description>

      <title>Data Science Education in Undergraduate Physics: Lessons Learned from a Community of Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing availability of diverse datasets, ranging from small-scale experimental data points to large and complex data repositories and powerful data analysis tools, it is increasingly important that physics educators equip their students with the skills to work with data effectively. However, many educators may lack the necessary training and expertise in data science to teach these skills. To address this gap, we created the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP), bringing together graduate students and physics educators from different institutions and backgrounds to share best practices and lessons learned in integrating data science into undergraduate physics education. In this article, we present insights and experiences from this community of practice, highlighting key strategies and challenges in incorporating data science into the introductory physics curriculum. Our goal is to provide guidance and inspiration to educators who seek to integrate data science into their teaching, helping to prepare the next generation of physicists for a data-driven world.</description>

      <title>Student Understanding of the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that is attracting the attention of academics and industry experts alike. It requires talent from a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such opportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics of quantum information science, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we discuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a tutorial on the Bloch sphere, a useful visual tool for developing intuition about single quantum bits (qubits), which are the basic building block of any quantum computer. Students' understanding was evaluated after they received traditional lecture-based instruction on the requisite topics, and again after engaging with the tutorial. We observe, analyze, and discuss their improvement in performance on concepts covered in the tutorial.</description>

      <title>Gender Equity in Physics Labs: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article provides an overview of research on the topic of gender equity in educational physics labs. As many institutions and instructors seek to evolve or transform physics lab learning, it is important that changes are made that improve equity for all students along multiple axes of identity, including gender. The studies highlighted in this review article describe the existence of complex gender-based differences, e.g., in opportunities to tinker with lab equipment, as well as differences in grades, conceptual understanding, and motivational outcomes across a broad range of lab curricula and contexts. The studies also illustrate and explore social interactions and structures that can impact students' experiences based on their gender identities. Although there has been less scholarship focused on proposals to reduce gender-based inequities in labs, this review article also provides an overview of some relevant proposals as well as associated research results. This overview of research on gender equity in physics labs helps to make clear that future scholarship on equity in physics labs should adopt gender frameworks that allow researchers to transcend binary gender identities and student deficit framing of research results. Likewise, a case is made that future research is needed on equity along other axes of identity, as well as research that accounts for intersectionality of different identities, in the physics lab context.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Transforming Second-Year Honors Physics Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New technology like the Arduino microcontroller platform presents an opportunity to transform Beyond the First Year (BFY) physics labs to better prepare physics students for work in research labs and beyond. The flexibility, low cost, and power of these devices provides an attractive way for students to learn to use and master research-grade instrumentation. Therefore, we introduced new technology, including Arduino Due microcontroller boards, to a second-year honors physics lab in order to provide improved learning experiences for students. This transformation was implemented in three lab modules and focused on diminishing the black box nature of the traditional labs while encouraging students to engage in troubleshooting. The importance of troubleshooting was made evident to students by the instructor emphasizing it as an inevitable and central part of experimentation. This lab transformation also required that students perform work that was `above and beyond' the scope of the assigned experimental work for part of the course credit. While the technological aspects of the transformation were received well by a majority of students, our observations during the initial implementation suggested a need for some modifications to instructional practices in order to improve the learning and experiences for all students. In particular, we find that many students can benefit from additional scaffolding in order to complete `above and beyond' work. Similarly, we find that students in general, and underrepresented students such as women in particular, may need thoughtful intervention from the instructor, e.g., in order to avoid becoming isolated when the lab work is designed for pair work. Otherwise, some students may be left to work alone with a disproportionate work-load if students choose their own partners.</description>

      <title>Simple portable quantum key distribution for science outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has become an essential technology in the realm of secure communication, with applications ranging from secure data transmission to quantum networks. This paper presents a simple, compact, and cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available. Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects.</description>
