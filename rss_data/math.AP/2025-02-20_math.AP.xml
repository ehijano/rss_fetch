      <title>On a semilinear parabolic equation with time-dependent source term on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with semilinear parabolic equations, with a time-dependent source term of the form $h(t)u^q$ with $q&gt;1$, posed on an infinite graph. We assume that the bottom of the $L^2$-spectrum of the Laplacian on the graph, denoted by $\lambda_1(G)$, is positive. In dependence of $q, h(t)$ and $\lambda_1(G)$, we show global in time existence or finite time blow-up of solutions.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of a Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Type Model of Grain Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most technologically useful materials spanning multiple length scales are polycrystalline. Polycrystalline microstructures are composed of a myriad of small crystals or grains with different lattice orientations which are separated by interfaces or grain boundaries. The changes in the grain and grain boundary structure of polycrystals highly influence the materials properties including, but not limited to, electrical, mechanical, and thermal. Thus, an understanding of how microstructures evolve is essential for the engineering of new materials. In this paper, we consider a recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck-type system and establish a global well-posedness result for it. Such systems under specific energy laws emerge in the modeling of the grain boundary dynamics in polycrystals.</description>

      <title>A new transformation for the subcritical fast diffusion equation with source and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new transformation for radially symmetric solutions to the subcritical fast diffusion equation with spatially inhomogeneous source $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, $$ posed for $(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty)$ and with dimension and exponents $$ N\geq3, \quad 0&lt;m&lt;m_c:=\frac{N-2}{N}, \quad \sigma\in(-2,\infty), $$ is introduced. It plays a role of a kind of symmetry with respect to the critical exponents $$ m_s=\frac{N-2}{N+2}, \quad p_L(\sigma)=1+\frac{\sigma(1-m)}{2}, \quad p_s(\sigma)=\frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}. $$ This transformation is then applied for classifying self-similar solutions with or without finite time blow-up to the subcritical fast diffusion equation with source when $p&gt;\max\{1,p_L(\sigma)\}$, having as starting point previous results by the authors.</description>

      <title>A common approach to singular perturbation and homogenization III: Nonlinear periodic homogenization with localized defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider periodic homogenization with localized defects for semilinear elliptic equations and systems of the type $$ \nabla\cdot\Big(\Big(A(x/\varepsilon)+B(x/\varepsilon)\Big)\nabla u(x)+c(x,u(x)\Big)=d(x,u(x)) \mbox{ in } \Omega $$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we show existence of weak solutions $u=u_\varepsilon$ as well as their local uniqueness for $\|u-u_0\|_\infty \approx 0$, where $u_0$ is a given non-degenerate weak solution to the homogenized problem. Moreover, we prove that $\|u_\varepsilon-u_0\|_\infty\to 0$ for $\varepsilon \to 0$, and we estimate the corresponding rate of convergence. Our assumptions are, roughly speaking, as follows: $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain, $A$, $B$, $c(\cdot,u)$ and $d(\cdot,u)$ are bounded and measurable, $c(x,\cdot)$ and $d(x,\cdot)$ are $C^1$-smooth, $A$ is periodic, and $B$ is a localized defect. Neither global uniqueness is supposed nor growth restriction for $c(x,\cdot)$ or $d(x,\cdot)$.
  The main tool of the proofs is an abstract result of implicit function theorem type which permits a common approach to nonlinear singular perturbation and homogenization.</description>

      <title>Density estimates for a nonlocal variational model with a degenerate double-well potential via the Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide density estimates for level sets of minimizers of the energy
  $\frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}dxdy+\int_{\Omega}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}dxdy+\int_{\Omega}W(u(x))dx$
  where $p\in(1,+\infty)$ and $s\in\left(0,\frac{1}{p}\right)$ and $W$ is a double-well potential with polynomial growth $m\in [p,+\infty)$ from the minima.
  These kinds of potentials are ''degenerate'', since they detach ''slowly'' from the minima, therefore they provide additional difficulties if one wishes to determine the relative sizes of the ''layers'' and the ''pure phases''. To overcome these challenges, we introduce new barriers allowing us to rely on the fractional Sobolev inequality and on a suitable iteration method.
  The proofs presented here are robust enough to consider the case of quasilinear nonlocal equations driven by the fractional $p$-Laplacian, but our results are new even for the case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Concentration phenomena to a chemotaxis system with indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a parabolic-ODE-parabolic chemotaxis system with radially symmetric initial data in a two-dimensional disk under the $0$-Neumann boundary condition. Although our system shares similar mathematical structures as the Keller--Segel system, the remarkable characteristic of the system we consider is that its solutions cannot blow up in finite time. In this paper, focusing on blow-up solutions in infinite time, we confirm concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system have a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. This means that there exist a time sequence $\{t_k\}$, a weight $m \ge 8\pi$, and a nonnegative function $f \in L^1(\Omega)$ such that \begin{align*} u(\cdot,t_k) \stackrel{*}{\rightharpoonup} m \delta (0) + f\ \mathrm{as}\ t_k \to \infty. \end{align*} We highlight this result is obtained by showing uniform-in-time boundedness of some energy functional. Moreover, we study whether $m = 8\pi$ or $m &gt; 8\pi$, which is an open problem in the Keller--Segel system. It is proved that the weight $m$ of a delta function singularity is larger than $8\pi$ under a specific assumption associated with a Lyapunov functional. This finding suggests the relationship between solutions blowing up in infinite time and an unboundedness of a Lyapunov functional, which contrasts with the Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <title>Comparison principles and asymptotic behavior of delayed age-structured neuron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of neuroscience the elapsed-time model is an age-structured equation that describes the behavior of interconnected spiking neurons through the time since the last discharge, with many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of this equation in the case of both discrete and distributed delays that account for the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest the ensemble. To prove the convergence to the equilibrium, we follow an approach based on comparison principles for Volterra equations involving the total activity, which provides a simpler and more straightforward alternative technique than those in the existing literature on the elapsed-time model.</description>

      <title>Global existence for a nonisothermal and conserved phase field system with inertial term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a conserved phase field system that couples the energy balance equation with a Cahn--Hilliard type system including temperature and the inertial term for the order parameter. In the case without inertial term, the system under study was introduced by Caginalp. The inertial term is motivated by the occurrence of rapid phase transformation processes in nonequilibrium dynamics. A double-well potential is well chosen and the related nonlinearity governing the evolution is assumed to satisfy a suitable growth condition. The viscous variant of the Cahn--Hilliard system is also considered along with the inertial term. The existence of a global solution is proved via the analysis of some approximate problems with Yosida regularizations, and the use of the Cauchy--Lipschitz--Picard theorem in an abstract setting. Moreover, we study the convergence of the system, with or without the viscous term, as the inertial coefficient tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the half Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically flat backgrounds and applications to cubic Dirac equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish the $L^2_t$-endpoint Strichartz estimate for (half) Klein-Gordon equations on a weakly asymptotically flat space-time. As an application we prove small data global well-posedness and scattering for massive cubic Dirac equations in the full subcritical range in this setting.
  Crucial ingredient is a parametrix contruction following the work of Metcalfe-Tataru and Xue and complements Strichartz estimates obtained by Zheng-Zhang. The proof of the global result for the cubic Dirac equation follows the strategy developed by Machihara-Nakanishi-Ozawa in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scalar conservation laws with smoothly varying spatially heterogeneous flux that is convex in the conserved variable. We show that under certain assumptions, a shock wave connecting two constant states emerges in finite time for all $L^{\infty}$ initial data satisfying the same far-field conditions. Under an additional assumption on the mixed partial derivative of the flux, we establish the stability of these simple shock profiles with respect to $L^2$ perturbations. The main tools we use are Dafermos' generalised characteristics for the evolution analysis and the relative entropy method for stability.</description>

      <title>A class of parabolic reaction-diffusion systems governed by spectral fractional Laplacians : Analysis and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global-in-time existence of strong solutions to a class of fractional parabolic reaction-diffusion systems set in a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The diffusion operators are of the form $u_i \mapsto d_i (-\Delta)_{Sp}^{s_i} u_i$, where $0&lt;s_i&lt;1$. The operator $(-\Delta)_{Sp}^{s}$ stands for the commonly called spectral fractional Laplacian. Moreover, the nonlinear reactive terms are assumed to fulfill natural structural conditions that ensure the nonnegativity of the solutions and provide uniform control of the total mass. We establish the global existence of strong solutions under the assumption that the nonlinearities exhibit at most polynomial growth. Our results extend previous results obtained when the diffusion operators are of the form $u_i\mapsto d_i (-\Delta)^s u_i$, where $(-\Delta)^s$ denotes the widely known as regional fractional Laplacian. Furthermore, we use numerical simulations to investigate the global existence of solutions to the fractional version of the so-called ``Brusselator'' system, a theoretical question that remains open to date.</description>

      <title>The anisotropic Cahn--Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility: Existence of weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an existence result for the anisotropic Cahn--Hilliard equation characterized by a potentially concentration-dependent degenerate mobility taking into account an anisotropic energy. The model allows for the degeneracy of the mobility at specific concentration values, demonstrating that the solution remains within physically relevant bounds. The introduction of anisotropy leads to highly nonlinear terms making energy and entropy estimates rather involved. As the mobility degenerates in the pure phases, the degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation describes surface diffusion and is an important model to model solid-state dewetting (SSD) of thin films. We show existence of weak solutions for the anisotropic degenerate Cahn--Hilliard equation by using suitable energy and entropy type estimates.</description>

      <title>Multi-spots Steady States in Two-species Keller-Segel Models with Logistic Growth: Large Chemotactic Attraction Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important findings in the study of chemotactic process is self-organized cellular aggregation, and a high volume of results are devoted to the analysis of a concentration of single species. Whereas, the multi-species case is not understood as well as the single species one. In this paper, we consider two-species chemotaxis systems with logistic source in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^2.$ Under the large chemo-attractive coefficients and one certain type of chemical production coefficient matrices, we employ the inner-outer gluing approach to construct multi-spots steady states, in which the profiles of cellular densities have strong connections with the entire solutions to Liouville systems and their locations are determined in terms of reduced-wave Green's functions. In particular, some numerical simulations and formal analysis are performed to support our rigorous studies.</description>

      <title>The Light ray transform for pseudo-Euclidean metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Existence of nonsymmetric logarithmic spiral vortex sheet solutions to the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation in the form of $M\geq 1$ cocentric logarithmic spirals. We prove the existence of a generic family of spirals that are nonsymmetric in the sense that the angles of the individual spirals are not uniformly distributed over the unit circle. Namely, we show that if $M=2$ or $M\geq 3 $ is an odd integer such that certain non-degeneracy conditions hold, then, for each $n \in \{ 1,2 \}$, there exists a logarithmic spiral with $M$ branches of relative angles arbitrarily close to $\bar\theta_{k} = kn\pi/M$ for $k=0,1,\ldots , M-1$, which include halves of the angles of the Alexander spirals. We show that the non-degeneracy conditions are satisfied if $M\in \{ 2, 3,5,7,9 \}$, and that the conditions hold for all odd $M&gt;9$ given a certain gradient matrix is invertible, which appears to be true by numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Stable solutions to fractional semilinear equations: uniqueness, classification, and approximation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stable solutions to fractional semilinear equations $(-\Delta)^s u = f(u)$ in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, for convex nonlinearities $f$, and under the Dirichlet exterior condition $u=g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega$ with general $g$. We establish a uniqueness and a classification result, and we show that weak (energy) stable solutions can be approximated by a sequence of bounded (and hence regular) stable solutions to similar problems.
  As an application of our results, we establish the interior regularity of weak (energy) stable solutions to the problem for the half-Laplacian in dimensions $1 \leq n \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Stability of complement value problems for $p$-L\'evy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up a general framework tailor-made to solve complement value problems governed by symmetric nonlinear integrodifferential $p$-L\'evy operators. A prototypical example of integrodifferential $p$-L\'evy operators is the well-known fractional $p$-Laplace operator. Our main focus is on nonlinear IDEs in the presence of Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin conditions and we show well-posedness results. Several results are new even for the fractional $p$-Laplace operator but we develop the approach for general translation-invariant nonlocal operators. We also bridge a gap from nonlocal to local, by showing that solutions to the local Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems associated with $p$-Laplacian are strong limits of the nonlocal ones.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Wasserstein gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy in
  inhomogeneous media. Both the energy and media can depend on the spatial variable in a fast oscillatory manner. In particular, we show that the gradient-flow structure is preserved in the limit which is expressed in terms of an effective energy and Wasserstein metric. The gradient flow and its limiting behavior are analyzed through an energy dissipation inequality (EDI). The result is consistent with asymptotic analysis in the realm of homogenization. However, we note that the effective metric is in general different from that obtained from the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces. We apply our framework to a linear Fokker-Planck equation but we believe the approach is robust enough to be applicable in a broader context.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet eigenfunctions with nonzero mean value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Laplacian eigenfunctions on a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Under Neumann boundary conditions, the first eigenfunction is constant and the others have mean value 0. The situation is different for Dirichlet boundary conditions: on `generic' domains, one would expect that every eigenfunction has nonzero mean value. The other extreme is the ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where among the first $n$ eigenfunctions only $\sim n^{1/d}$ have a mean value different from zero. We prove that this rate is sharp in \textit{any} smooth domain, up to a logarithmic factor: in any smooth domain~$\Omega$, among the first $n$ Dirichlet eigenfunctions at least $ (\log{n})^{-1/2} \cdot n^{1/d} $ have a nonzero mean.</description>

      <title>Global solution of 2D hyperbolic liquid crystal system for small initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the global stability of small perturbation near the constant equilibrium for the two dimensional simplified Ericksen-Leslie's hyperbolic system for incompressible liquid crystal model, where the direction function of liquid crystal molecules satisfies a wave map equation with an acoustical metric. This improves the almost global existence result by Huang-Jiang-Zhao. As byproducts, we obtain the sharp (same as the linear solution) decay estimates for both the heat part and the wave part. Moreover the nonlinear wave part scatters to a linear solution as time goes to infinity.
  This paper's main contribution is the discovery of a novel null structure within the velocity equation's wave-type quadratic self-interaction. This structure compensates the insufficient decay rate in 2D, which previously hindered the establishment of global regularity for small data.</description>

      <title>Critical curve for a weakly coupled system of semi-linear $\sigma$-evolution equations with different damping types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to consider the Cauchy problem for a weakly coupled system of semi linear $sigma$ evolution equations with different damping mechanisms for any $\sigma&gt;1$, parabolic like damping and $\sigma$ evolution like damping. Motivated strongly by the well known Nakao's problem, the main goal of this work is to determine the critical curve between the power exponents $p$ and $q$ of nonlinear terms by not only establishing the global well posedness property of small data solutions but also indicating blow up in finite time solutions. We want to point out that the application of a modified test function associated with a judicious choice of test functions really plays an essential role to show a blow up result for solutions and upper bound estimates for lifespan of solutions, where $\sigma$ is assumed to be any fractional number. To end this paper, lower bound estimates for lifespan of solutions are also shown to verify their sharp results in some spatial dimensions</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A rigorous approach to pattern formation for isotropic isoperimetric problems with competing nonlocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous approach to the study of the symmetry breaking and pattern formation phenomenon for isotropic functionals with local/nonlocal interactions in competition.
  We consider a general class of nonlocal variational problems in dimension $d\geq 2$, in which an isotropic surface term favouring pure phases competes with an isotropic nonlocal term with power law kernel favouring alternation between different phases.
  Close to the critical regime in which the two terms are of the same order, we give a rigorous proof of the conjectured structure of global minimizers, in the shape of domains with flat boundary (e.g., stripes or lamellae).
  The natural framework in which our approach is set and developed is the one of calculus of variations and geometric measure theory.
  Among others, we detect a nonlocal curvature-type quantity which is controlled by the energy functional and whose finiteness implies flatness for sufficiently regular boundaries.
  The power of decay of the considered kernels at infinity is $p\geq d+3$ and it is related to pattern formation in synthetic antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Observability and controllability for Schr\"odinger equations in the semi-periodic setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strichartz estimates, well-posedness theory and long time behavior for (nonlinear) Schr\"odinger equations on waveguide manifolds $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$ are intensively studied in recent decades while the corresponding control theory and observability estimates remain incomplete. The purpose of this short paper is to investigate the observability and controllability for Schr\"odinger equations in the waveguide (semi-periodic) setting.
  Our main result establishes local exact controllability for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$, under certain geometric conditions on the control region. To address the nonlinear control problem, we begin by analyzing the observability properties of the linear Schr\"odinger operator on a general waveguide manifold $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$. Utilizing $H^s$ estimates of the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM) operator and Bourgain spaces, we then prove local exact controllability through a fixed-point method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neufeld and Wu (arXiv:2310.12545) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP schema in arXiv:2310.12545 does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in arXiv:2310.12545 indeed can overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear part of the corresponding PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both 4-harmonic and ES-4-harmonic maps are two higher order generalizations of the well-studied harmonic map equation given by a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation of order eight. Due to the large number of derivatives it is very difficult to find any difference in the qualitative behavior of these two variational problems. It is well known that the small hypersphere \(\iota\colon\s^m(\frac{1}{2})\to\s^{m+1}\) is a critical point of both the 4-energy as well as the ES-4-energy but up to now it has not been investigated if there is a difference concerning its stability.
  The main contribution of this article is to show that the small hypersphere is unstable with respect to normal variations both as 4-harmonic hypersphere as well as ES-4-harmonic hypersphere and that its normal index equals one in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Global critical points of the Standard Model on four-dimensional spacetimes of expanding type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of elementary particle physics is one of the most successful models of contemporary theoretical physics being in full agreement with experiments. However, its mathematical structure deserves further investigations both from a geometric and an analytic point of view. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a mathematically well-defined and self-contained description of the Standard Model in terms of gauge theory and differential geometry on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Within this setup we then prove the existence of a global solution for the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Standard Model (with the conformal Higgs potential) under the assumptions that the globally hyperbolic manifold is a four-dimensional spacetime of expanding type and small initial data. This is achieved by establishing a gauge-invariant energy estimate which is of independent mathematical interest.</description>

Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>
