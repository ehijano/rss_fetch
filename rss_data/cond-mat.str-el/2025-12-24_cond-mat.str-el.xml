      <title>All-to-All interactions via multifractal wavefunction geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Preparation of a Quantum Spin Liquid in Non-Hermitian Quantum Dimer Models and Rydberg Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.</description>

      <title>Bosonization solution of the Kondo lattice in a Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the physics of a regular arrangement of independent magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons. We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Semi-automated estimation of hydrogenic initial states for localized Wannier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-automated method for obtaining an initial estimate of Wannier functions, designed to facilitate the construction of Wannier functions for describing low-energy effective models of solids, particularly those relevant to strongly correlated electron systems. Our approach automatically determines the hydrogenic projections orbitals and the center of the Wannier functions from information on Bloch wavefunctions at the $\Gamma$ point. This method is integrated into cif2qewan, enabling seamless generation of input files for Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90. We validate our method through applications to both inorganic and organic compounds, such as Si, SrVO$_3$, FeSe, Na$_8$Al$_6$Si$_6$O$_{24}$, and (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$. The obtained results demonstrate that our semi-automated projections give a good initial estimate of the Wannier functions. We also show the comparisons with other methods for estimating the initial states of the Wannier functions, such as the Selected Columns of the Density Matrix (SCDM). Our methodology shows an efficient way to construct Wannier functions, paving the way for high-throughput calculations in the study of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Wigner Transformation for the Description of Strong Correlation in Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly-correlated electronic systems, but has combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Phase Diagram and Nonlinear Optical Responses of a Twisted Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .</description>

      <title>Multiple topological phases of magnons induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and pseudodipolar anisotropic exchange interactions in Kagome ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network study of the ground state of maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group scheme adapted to $C_3$-symmetric lattices. Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs thermal fluctuations in phase transitions of two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity at finite magnetic field for graphene, non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi-like entanglement probe of the chiral central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $\alpha, \beta$, and can be seen as a ``R\'enyi-like" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, our quantity $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $\omega_{\alpha,\beta}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hole-doped NdNiO$_2$ layer deposited on the SrTiO$_{3}$ surface exhibits unconventional superconductivity. Here, we present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of the NdNiO$_2$ superconductor using the density functional theory (DFT). The strong local Coulomb interactions in the Ni($3d)$ and Nd($4f$) states are included within the DFT+$U$ method. The effect of Sr doping on the electronic band structure and density of states was studied for the NdNiO$_2$ thin films deposited on the SrTiO$_3$ (001) surface. The results obtained for the uncapped thin films were compared with the calculations for the NdNiO$_2$ films capped by the SrTiO$_3$ layer. We have found significant changes in the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the thin films compared to the bulk crystal.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Near a Quantum Critical Point: Bounds on the Transition Temperature in the $\gamma$-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near a quantum critical point (QCP) in a metal, strong Fermion-Fermion interactions mediated by soft collective bosons give rise to two competing phenomena: non-Fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity that deviates from conventional BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theories. We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma &gt; 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Charge-to-Spin Conversion and Tunneling Magnetoresistance in Quasi-Two-Dimensional d-wave Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnets has driven groundbreaking advances in spintronics. Notably, d-wave altermagnets support non-relativistic spin transport, efficient charge-to-spin conversion, and T-odd spin currents. In addition, their integration as electrodes in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) enables a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, allowing electrical detection of N\'eel vectors for next-generation memory devices. In this work, we investigate the non-relativistic spin transport properties of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) d-wave altermagnet KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O and the TMR effect in KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs via first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O exhibits a non-relativistic longitudinal spin polarization and a spin Hall angle both exceeding 60\% at room temperature, while KV\textsubscript{2}Se\textsubscript{2}O-based AFMTJs achieve a giant TMR reaching approximately $10^{12}$\%, which remains robust against Fermi level shifts. These findings highlight the anisotropic spin polarization inherent to d-wave staggered magnetism and underscore the critical role of Fermi surface topology in enhancing T-odd spin transport and the TMR effect in AFMTJs.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Superconducting Dome Accompanied by Non-Fermi Liquid Transport in Ionic Liquid Gated-MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of ordered magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials at the monolayer limit challenges the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions at finite temperatures. The persistence of static magnetism in low-dimensions is fundamentally influenced by magnetic anisotropy and the local single-ion crystalline electric field. Crucially, spin-orbit coupling connects the structural properties with spin degrees of freedom. We investigate the magnetic single-ion properties in the van der Waals magnet VI$_3$. Utilizing neutron and x-ray diffraction, we map out the symmetry breaking phase transitions and argue for a single structural transition at T$_S \sim$ 80 K, driven by an orbital degeneracy, followed by a ferromagnetic transition at a lower temperature, T$_C \sim$ 50 K. Through a comparative analysis of samples prepared under varying conditions, we suggest that lower temperature transitions reported near $\sim$ 30 K are not intrinsic to VI$_{3}$. A group theoretical analysis suggests a structural transition from rhombohedral $R\overline{3}$ to triclinic $P\overline{1}$ or $P1$. This transition is significant as it suggests the formation of two distinct crystallographyically inequivalent V$^{3+}$ sites, each with distinct spin-orbital properties. Neutron spectroscopy provides evidence for dominant magnetic exchange coupling only between symmetry-equivalent sites in the triclinc unit cell. We suggest this breaks up the low-temperature honeycomb VI$_3$ lattice into two interpenetrating approximately hexagonal planes resulting in a fragmentated honeycomb. Our findings highlight the critical role of magnetoelastic coupling in determining the magnetic and structural phases in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Towards compressed baryonic matter densities: thermodynamics and transport coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic and transport properties of hot and dense quantum chromodynamic matter expected to be produced in low-energy heavy-ion collisions, using three different effective quantum chromodynamic frameworks: the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, the chiral effective model, and the hadron resonance gas model. We briefly outline the theoretical formulation of thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients within these approaches, where quarks are treated with effective masses in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and chiral effective models, and hadronic degrees of freedom are employed in the hadron resonance gas model. The transport coefficients are evaluated using the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. Following the theoretical overview, we present a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of these quantities as functions of the baryon chemical potential or net baryon density. The Lorenz ratio $\kappa/(\sigma T)$ is found to increase rapidly-indicating a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low-$\mu_{B}$ regime--while approaching the universal value at higher baryon chemical potentials or densities. The shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio $\eta/s$ remains nearly constant at low $\mu_{B}$ but exhibits a gradual increase as $\mu_{B}$ grows. We also discuss the qualitative similarities of these trends with those observed in the electron-hole plasma of graphene, an emergent quasi-relativistic system characterized by massless energy-momentum dispersion.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-degenerate orbital origin of two-dome phases in iron pnictide superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of experiments revealed that novel bipartite magnetic and superconducting (SC) phases widely exist in the phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome magnetic and SC phases in iron-based compounds remains unclear. Here we theoretically investigated the electronic structures, magnetic and SC properties of three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$, LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory, Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.</description>

      <title>Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn) Heusler alloys as candidate materials for spintronic and microelectronic applications: Electronic structure, transport, and magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and electronic transport properties of Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ga, Ge, Si, Sn) Heusler alloys were experimentally investigated. Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $\Gamma$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytical method for the construction of Hartree-Fock phase diagrams for the (fermion) Hubbard model and various generalizations thereof. Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Cuprates, Pnictides and Sulfosalts: Lessons in Functional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Murunskite K$_2$Cu$_3$FeS$_4$ is a representative sulfosalt, isostructural to the pnictides, but with electronic properties more similar to the insulating parent compounds of the cuprates. We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.
  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.
  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of plasmons in half-filled graphene via Quantum Monte Carlo and Random Phase Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $\Gamma$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.</description>

      <title>Bridging constrained random-phase approximation and linear response theory for computing Hubbard parameters</title>

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of popular extensions to density-functional theory (DFT) such as DFT+U and DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) hinges on using realistic values for the screened Coulomb interaction U. Here, we present a systematic comparison of the two most widely used approaches to compute this parameter, i.e. linear response theory (LRT) and the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), using a unified framework based on the use of maximally localized Wannier functions. We show that the U in LRT and cRPA can differ as much as 30%. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from two main differences: neglecting the response of the exchange-correlation potential in cRPA and additional excitation channels in LRT. By taking these differences into account, we can achieve near perfect agreement between the two techniques. Moreover, we show that in cases with strong hybridization between interacting and screening subspaces, the application of cRPA becomes ambiguous and can lead to unrealistically small U values, while LRT remains well-behaved. Our work formally connects both methods, sheds light on their strengths and limitations, and emphasizes the importance of using a consistent set of Wannier orbitals to ensure transferability of U values between different implementations.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>

      <title>Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e flatbands with high Chern numbers (C&gt;1) offer opportunities to study the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects that go beyond the Landau level paradigm with C=1, which remain unexplored yet. Here, we target the novel topological phases in high Chern number flatbands by designing a new moir\'e system, i.e., twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe quantized anomalous Hall effects (QAH) with C = 3 at v = 1 and v = 3, demonstrating the high Chern number nature of the flat band from continuum calculations. By fractionally filling the flat band, we observe QAH with C = 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 3/2, as well as QAH with C = 3 continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields. Most importantly, we observe, for the first time, evidence of an FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, corresponding to 2/5 filling of a high Chern number flat band with C = -3, verified by both Streda formula analysis and a fractionally QAH. It is also worth noting that Streda formula analysis reveals a signature of another FCI with C = -3/2 at v = 5/2 under finite magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moir\'e superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of fractional phases with C &lt; 1.</description>

      <title>Emergence of quantum spin liquid and spin-flop phase in Kitaev antiferromagnets in a [111] magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moir\'e systems using tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Electronic Structure of van der Waals Antiferromagnetic NiPS$_3$ through Synchrotron-Based $\mu$-ARPES and Alkali Metal Dosing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the band structure in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals layered antiferromagnet, utilizing high-resolution synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and corroborative density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By tuning the parameters of the light source, we obtained a very clear and wide energy range band structure of NiPS$_3$. Comparison with DFT calculations allows for the identification of the orbital character of the observed bands. Our DFT calculations perfectly match the experimental results, and no adaptations were made to the calculations based on the experimental outcomes. The appearance of novel electronic structure upon alkali metal dosing (AMD) were also obtained in this ARPES study. Above valence band maximum, structure of conduction bands and bands from defect states were firstly observed in NiPS$_3$. We provide the direct determination of the band gap of NiPS$_3$ as 1.3 eV from the band structure by AMD. In addition, detailed temperature dependent ARPES spectra were obtained across a range that spans both below and above the N\'eel transition temperature of NiPS$_3$. We found that the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states have almost identical spectra, indicating the highly localized nature of Ni $d$ states.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a nontrivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>
