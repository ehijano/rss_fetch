      <title>radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Novel rotor fault diagnostic method based on rlmd and ht techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency domain analysis using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been a popular method for diagnosing broken rotor bar (BRB) faults in squirrel-cage induction motors (IM). However, FFT analysis is limited by sampling frequency and time acquisition constraints, making it less effective under time-varying conditions. To overcome these difficulties, a novel BRB fault detection method for non-stationary conditions is proposed. The proposed strategy is based on the recently developed robust local mean decomposition (RLMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) methods. Using these techniques, the BRB characteristic frequency and amplitude component are obtained from only one phase stator current allowing automation of the features detection process. in fact, HT is used to extract the stator current envelope (SCE). Then, the SCE is processed by RLMD for determining the sub signals production functions (PFs). Finally, HT is applied to the most sensible PF to compute its instantaneous frequency and amplitude. The tracking of the BRB fault characteristic can inform us about the condition of the induction motor. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic strategy is validated through simulation conducted in the Matlab environment. The simulation results show the capability of this method to track accurately the frequency and amplitude of the 2sf component where f and s represent the fundamental stator current frequency and motor slip respectively</description>

      <title>Step-to-Charge: mW-scale power transfer to on-body devices for long channel (&gt; 1m) with EQS Resonant Human Body Powering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current limits of harvested energy in wearables are governed by three fundamental quantities, the physical limits of available energy density in ambient powering, safety limits in intentional powering, and the size of the wearable device. Typical energy harvested, except for solar power in favorable outdoor conditions, ranges from 5 uW to a maximum of 100 - 200 uW depending upon the available energy. Further, traditional intentional powering methodologies using ultrasound and radio-frequency either have a severe limitation in range of powering or are inefficient due to high path loss in Non-Line-of-Sight scenarios due to absorption by the body. In this study, we propose a novel approach using the human body, the common medium connecting the wearable devices, as a channel to transfer power. We demonstrate Human Body Powering using ``Step-to-Charge," a first-of-its-kind non-radiative, meter-scale powering methodology using a floor-based source and the human body as the channel to transfer power at lower channel losses to charge and power wearable devices across the whole body. The proposed powering methodology allows more than 2 mW peak power to be transferred to a wearable device for &gt;1m channel lengths, which is &gt; 90X greater than the state-of-the-art over previous Human Body Powering attempts. Step-to-Charge enables the powering of a new, extended range of wearable devices across the human body, bringing us closer to enabling battery-less perpetual operation using Human Body Power transfer.</description>

      <title>Harmonic MUSIC Method for mmWave Radar-based Vital Sign Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for the estimation of human vital signs. Aiming to obtain more accurate frequency estimation for periodic signals of respiration and heartbeat, we propose the harmonic MUSIC (HMUSIC) algorithm to consider harmonic components for frequency estimation of vital sign signals. In the experiments, we tested different subjects' vital signs. Experimental results demonstrate that the 89-th percentile errors in respiration rate and the 88-th percentile errors in heartbeat rate are less than 3 respirations per minute and 5 beats per minute.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spatial Multiplexing and Interference Suppression for Near- and Far-Field Communications with Sparse MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output has been a key technology for wireless systems for decades. For typical MIMO communication systems, antenna array elements are usually separated by half of the carrier wavelength, thus termed as conventional MIMO. In this paper, we investigate the performance of multi-user MIMO communication, with sparse arrays at both the transmitter and receiver side, i.e., the array elements are separated by more than half wavelength. Given the same number of array elements, the performance of sparse MIMO is compared with conventional MIMO. On one hand, sparse MIMO has a larger aperture, which can achieve narrower main lobe beams that make it easier to resolve densely located users. Besides, increased array aperture also enlarges the near-field communication region, which can enhance the spatial multiplexing gain, thanks to the spherical wavefront property in the near-field region. On the other hand, element spacing larger than half wavelength leads to undesired grating lobes, which, if left unattended, may cause severe inter-user interference. To gain further insights, we first study the spatial multiplexing gain of the basic single-user sparse MIMO communication system, where a closed-form expression of the near-field effective degree of freedom is derived. The result shows that the EDoF increases with the array sparsity for sparse MIMO before reaching its upper bound, which equals to the minimum value between the transmit and receive antenna numbers. Furthermore, the scaling law for the achievable data rate with varying array sparsity is analyzed and an array sparsity-selection strategy is proposed. We then consider the more general multi-user sparse MIMO communication system. It is shown that sparse MIMO is less likely to experience severe IUI than conventional MIMO.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Sensing Enabled Predictive Beamforming: From Estimation to Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near-field sensing (NISE) enabled predictive beamforming framework is proposed to facilitate wireless communications with high-mobility channels. Unlike conventional far-field sensing, which only captures the angle and the radial velocity of the user, NISE enables the estimation of the full motion state, including additional distance and transverse velocity information. Two full-motion state sensing approaches are proposed based on the concepts of estimation and tracking, respectively. 1)AGD-AO approach: The full motion state of the user is estimated within a single CPI. In particular, the gradient descent is adopted to estimate the transverse and radial velocities of the user based on the maximum likelihood criteria, while the distance and the angle are calculated by the kinematic model. In this process, moment estimations are leveraged to adaptively tune the step size, thereby leading to a smoother and faster gradient descent. 2) EKF approach: The full motion state of the user is tracked across multiple CPIs. Based on the noisy measurements in multiple CPIs, the EKF iteratively predicts and updates the current motion state to achieve a low tracking error. Based on the obtained full motion state, the beam prediction, and Doppler frequency compensation can be carried out with minimum pilot overhead. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the conventional far-field predictive beamforming and feedback-based approaches. It is also revealed that: 1)the proposed AGD-AO can achieve stable descending with small gradients, thereby accelerating convergence; 2) compared to far-field predictive beamforming and feedback-based schemes, both of the proposed methods exhibit superior performance; and 3) by incorporating multiple CPIs, the EKF method exhibits greater robustness in low SNR regions.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Design of RIS-Assisted Multi-cell Multi-band Networks with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been identified as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems due to its ability to manipulate the propagation environment intelligently. RIS is a frequency-selective device, thus it can only effectively manipulate the propagation of signals within a specific frequency band. This frequency selective characteristic can make deploying RIS in wireless cellular networks more challenging, as adjacent base stations (BSs) operate on different frequency bands. In addition, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme has been shown to enhance the performance of RIS-aided multi-user communication systems. Accordingly, this work considers a more practical reflection model for RIS-aided RSMA communication systems, which accounts for the responses of signals across different frequency bands. To that end, new analytical expressions for the ergodic sum-rate are derived using the moment generating function (MGF) and Jensen inequality. Based on these analytical sum-rate expressions, novel practical RIS reflection designs and power allocation strategies for the RSMA scheme are proposed and investigated to maximize the achievable sum-rate in RIS-assisted multi-cell, multi-band cellular networks. Simple sub-optimal designs are also introduced and discussed. The results validate the significant gains of our proposed reflection design algorithms with RSMA over conventional schemes in terms of achievable sum-rate. Additionally, the power allocation strategy for the RSMA scheme is shown to offer superior performance compared to conventional precoding schemes that do not rely on RSMA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel single-channel decomposition approach to facilitate the decomposition of electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded with limited channels. Our model posits that an EEG signal comprises short, shift-invariant waves, referred to as atoms. We design a decomposer as an artificial neural network aimed at estimating these atoms and detecting their time shifts and amplitude modulations within the input signal. The efficacy of our method was validated across various scenarios in brain--computer interfaces and neuroscience, demonstrating enhanced performance. Additionally, cross-dataset validation indicates the feasibility of a pre-trained model, enabling a plug-and-play signal decomposition module.</description>

      <title>IRS-Assisted OTFS: Beamforming Design and Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology has become a crucial enabler for creating cost effective, innovative, and adaptable wireless communication environments. This study investigates an IRS-assisted orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation that facilitates communication between users and the base station (BS). The users attainable downlink rate can be boosted by collaboratively improving the reflection coefficient (RC) matrix at the IRS and beamforming matrix at the BS. Then, in the IRS-aided OTFS network, the problem of cooperative precoding at BS and IRS to improve the network throughput is framed. The precoding design problem is non-convex and highly complicated; an alternate optimization (AO) approach is proposed to solve this. Specifically, an approach based on strongest tap maximization (STM) and fractional programming is proposed. It solves RC matrix (at IRS) and beamforming matrix (at BS) alternatively. Moreover, an efficient signal detector for IRS-aided OTFS communication systems using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed. Finally, to estimate the cascaded MIMO channel, using a parallel factor tensor model that separates the IRS-User and BS-IRS MIMO channels, respectively is suggested. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly enhances the system capacity and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OTFS.</description>

      <title>Blind User Activity Detection for Grant-Free Random Access in Cell-Free mMIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks have recently emerged as a promising solution to tackle the challenges arising from next-generation massive machine-type communications. In this paper, a fully grant-free deep learning (DL)-based method for user activity detection in CF-mMIMO networks is proposed. Initially, the known non-orthogonal pilot sequences are used to estimate the channel coefficients between each user and the access points. Then, a deep convolutional neural network is used to estimate the activity status of the users. The proposed method is "blind", i.e., it is fully data-driven and does not require prior large-scale fading coefficients estimation. Numerical results show how the proposed DL-based algorithm is able to merge the information gathered by the distributed antennas to estimate the user activity status, yet outperforming a state-of-the-art covariance-based method.</description>

      <title>Delay Conditioned Generative Modelling of Resistive Drift in Memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modelling of memristive devices is an essential part of the development of novel in-memory computing systems. Models are needed to enable the accurate and efficient simulation of memristor device characteristics, for purposes of testing the performance of the devices or the feasibility of their use in future neuromorphic and in-memory computing architectures. The consideration of memristor non-idealities is an essential part of any modelling approach. The nature of the deviation of memristive devices from their initial state, particularly at ambient temperature and in the absence of a stimulating voltage, is of key interest, as it dictates their reliability as information storage media - a property that is of importance for both traditional storage and neuromorphic applications. In this paper, we investigate the use of a generative modelling approach for the simulation of the delay and initial resistance-conditioned resistive drift distribution of memristive devices. We introduce a data normalisation scheme and a novel training technique to enable the generative model to be conditioned on the continuous inputs. The proposed generative modelling approach is suited for use in end-to-end training and device modelling scenarios, including learned data storage applications, due to its simulation efficiency and differentiability.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition of Interaction Force for Multi-Agent Co-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent human-robot co-manipulation is a poorly understood process with many inputs that potentially affect agent behavior. This paper explores one such input known as interaction force. Interaction force is potentially a primary component in communication that occurs during co-manipulation. There are, however, many different perspectives and definitions of interaction force in the literature. Therefore, a decomposition of interaction force is proposed that provides a consistent way of ascertaining the state of an agent relative to the group for multi-agent co-manipulation. This proposed method extends a current definition from one to four degrees of freedom, does not rely on a predefined object path, and is independent of the number of agents acting on the system and their locations and input wrenches (forces and torques). In addition, all of the necessary measures can be obtained by a self-contained robotic system, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive approach for future co-manipulation robot controllers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained significant interest since they enable precoding in the wave domain that comes with increased processing capability and reduced energy consumption. The study of SIMs and high frequency propagation make the study of the performance in the near field of crucial importance. Hence, in this work, we focus on SIM-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in the near field region. To this end, we formulate the weighted sum rate maximisation problem in terms of the transmit power and the phase shifts of the SIM. By applying a block coordinate descent (BCD)-relied algorithm, numerical results show the enhanced performance of the SIM in the near field with respect to the far field.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for PIN Diode-Based IRS-Assisted Systems Under a Phase Shift-Dependent Power Consumption Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been regarded as a promising enabler for future wireless communication systems. In the literature, IRSs have been considered power-free or assumed to have constant power consumption. However, recent experimental results have shown that for positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode-based IRSs, the power consumption dynamically changes with the phase shift configuration. This phase shift-dependent power consumption (PS-DPC) introduces a challenging power allocation problem between base station (BS) and IRS. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we investigate a rate maximization problem for IRS-assisted systems under a practical PS-DPC model. For the single-user case, we propose a generalized Benders decomposition-based beamforming method to maximize the achievable rate while satisfying a total system power consumption constraint. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity beamforming design, where the powers allocated to BS and IRS are optimized offline based on statistical channel state information. Furthermore, for the multi-user case, we solve an equivalent weighted mean square error minimization problem with two different joint power allocation and phase shift optimization methods. Simulation results indicate that compared to baseline schemes, our proposed methods can flexibly optimize the power allocation between BS and IRS, thus achieving better performance. The optimized power allocation strategy strongly depends on the system power budget. When the system power budget is high, the PS-DPC is not the dominant factor in the system power consumption, allowing the IRS to turn on as many PIN diodes as needed to achieve high beamforming quality. When the system power budget is limited, however, more power tends to be allocated to the BS to enhance the transmit power, resulting in a lower beamforming quality at the IRS due to the reduced PS-DPC budget.</description>

Abstract: Embedded spaces are a key feature in deep learning. Good embedded spaces represent the data well to support classification and advanced techniques such as open-set recognition, few-short learning and explainability. This paper presents a compact overview of different techniques to design embedded spaces for classification. It compares different loss functions and constraints on the network parameters with respect to the achievable geometric structure of the embedded space. The techniques are demonstrated with two and three-dimensional embeddings for the MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, allowing visual inspection of the embedded spaces.</description>

      <title>Graph Unfolding and Sampling for Transitory Video Summarization via Gershgorin Disc Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-generated videos (UGVs) uploaded from mobile phones to social media sites like YouTube and TikTok are short and non-repetitive. We summarize a transitory UGV into several keyframes in linear time via fast graph sampling based on Gershgorin disc alignment (GDA). Specifically, we first model a sequence of $N$ frames in a UGV as an $M$-hop path graph $\mathcal{G}^o$ for $M \ll N$, where the similarity between two frames within $M$ time instants is encoded as a positive edge based on feature similarity. Towards efficient sampling, we then "unfold" $\mathcal{G}^o$ to a $1$-hop path graph $\mathcal{G}$, specified by a generalized graph Laplacian matrix $\mathcal{L}$, via one of two graph unfolding procedures with provable performance bounds. We show that maximizing the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\min}(\mathbf{B})$ of a coefficient matrix $\mathbf{B} = \textit{diag}\left(\mathbf{h}\right) + \mu \mathcal{L}$, where $\mathbf{h}$ is the binary keyframe selection vector, is equivalent to minimizing a worst-case signal reconstruction error. We maximize instead the Gershgorin circle theorem (GCT) lower bound $\lambda^-_{\min}(\mathbf{B})$ by choosing $\mathbf{h}$ via a new fast graph sampling algorithm that iteratively aligns left-ends of Gershgorin discs for all graph nodes (frames). Extensive experiments on multiple short video datasets show that our algorithm achieves comparable or better video summarization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, at a substantially reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.

      <title>Secure Semantic Communications: From Perspective of Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications have been envisioned as a potential technique that goes beyond Shannon paradigm. Unlike modern communications that provide bit-level security, the eaves-dropping of semantic communications poses a significant risk of potentially exposing intention of legitimate user. To address this challenge, a novel deep neural network (DNN) enabled secure semantic communication (DeepSSC) system is developed by capitalizing on physical layer security. To balance the tradeoff between security and reliability, a two-phase training method for DNNs is devised. Particularly, Phase I aims at semantic recovery of legitimate user, while Phase II attempts to minimize the leakage of semantic information to eavesdroppers. The loss functions of DeepSSC in Phases I and II are respectively designed according to Shannon capacity and secure channel capacity, which are approximated with variational inference. Moreover, we define the metric of secure bilingual evaluation understudy (S-BLEU) to assess the security of semantic communications. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that DeepSSC achieves a significant boost to semantic security particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio regime, despite a minor degradation of reliability.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Perturbation-based Non-Convex Optimization over Time-Varying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization strategies are helpful for various applications, from networked estimation to distributed machine learning. This paper studies finite-sum minimization problems described over a network of nodes and proposes a computationally efficient algorithm that solves distributed convex problems and optimally finds the solution to locally non-convex objective functions. In contrast to batch gradient optimization in some literature, our algorithm is on a single-time scale with no extra inner consensus loop. It evaluates one gradient entry per node per time. Further, the algorithm addresses link-level nonlinearity representing, for example, logarithmic quantization of the exchanged data or clipping of the exchanged data bits. Leveraging perturbation-based theory and algebraic Laplacian network analysis proves optimal convergence and dynamics stability over time-varying and switching networks. The time-varying network setup might be due to packet drops or link failures. Despite the nonlinear nature of the dynamics, we prove exact convergence in the face of odd sign-preserving sector-bound nonlinear data transmission over the links. Illustrative numerical simulations further highlight our contributions.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate and its Variability from Short-term ECG Recordings as Biomarkers for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment in Indian Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alterations in Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can reflect autonomic dysfunction associated with neurodegeneration. We investigate the influence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) on HR and its variability measures in the Indian population by designing a complete signal processing pipeline to detect the R-wave peaks and compute HR and HRV features from ECG recordings of 10 seconds, for point-of-care applications. The study cohort involves 297 urban participants, among which 48.48% are male and 51.51% are female. From the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III), MCI is detected in 19.19% of participants and the rest, 80.8% of them are cognitively healthy. Statistical features like central tendency (mean and root mean square (RMS) of the Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals) and dispersion (standard deviation (SD) of all NN intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals (RMSSD)) of beat-to-beat intervals are computed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test reveals that mean of NN intervals (p = 0.0021), the RMS of NN intervals (p = 0.0014), the SDNN (p = 0.0192) and the RMSSD (p = 0.0206) values differ significantly between MCI and non-MCI classes, for a level of significance, 0.05. Machine learning classifiers like, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Naive Bayes (NB) driven by mean NN intervals, RMS, SDNN and RMSSD, show a high accuracy of 80.80% on each individual feature input. Individuals with MCI are observed to have comparatively higher HR than healthy subjects. HR and its variability can be considered as potential biomarkers for detecting MCI.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Iterative Blind Detection based on Expectation Maximization and Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study iterative blind symbol detection for block-fading linear inter-symbol interference channels. Based on the factor graph framework, we design a joint channel estimation and detection scheme that combines the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the ubiquitous belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Interweaving the iterations of both schemes significantly reduces the EM algorithm's computational burden while retaining its excellent performance. To this end, we apply simple yet effective model-based learning methods to find a suitable parameter update schedule by introducing momentum in both the EM parameter updates as well as in the BP message passing. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed method can learn efficient schedules that generalize well and even outperform coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Convergence Theory for The Probability Flow ODEs of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, which convert noise into new data instances by learning to reverse a diffusion process, have become a cornerstone in contemporary generative modeling. In this work, we develop non-asymptotic convergence theory for a popular diffusion-based sampler (i.e., the probability flow ODE sampler) in discrete time, assuming access to $\ell_2$-accurate estimates of the (Stein) score functions. For distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove that $d/\varepsilon$ iterations -- modulo some logarithmic and lower-order terms -- are sufficient to approximate the target distribution to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance. This is the first result establishing nearly linear dimension-dependency (in $d$) for the probability flow ODE sampler. Imposing only minimal assumptions on the target data distribution (e.g., no smoothness assumption is imposed), our results also characterize how $\ell_2$ score estimation errors affect the quality of the data generation processes. In contrast to prior works, our theory is developed based on an elementary yet versatile non-asymptotic approach without the need of resorting to SDE and ODE toolboxes.</description>

      <title>Fair Resource Allocation For Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks via Deep Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has become a crucial research direction in future wireless communications due to its ubiquitous coverage, rapid and flexible deployment, and multi-layer cooperation capabilities. However, integrating hierarchical federated learning (HFL) with edge computing and SAGINs remains a complex open issue to be resolved. This paper proposes a novel framework for applying HFL in SAGINs, utilizing aerial platforms and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as edge servers and cloud servers, respectively, to provide multi-layer aggregation capabilities for HFL. The proposed system also considers the presence of inter-satellite links (ISLs), enabling satellites to exchange federated learning models with each other. Furthermore, we consider multiple different computational tasks that need to be completed within a limited satellite service time. To maximize the convergence performance of all tasks while ensuring fairness, we propose the use of the distributional soft-actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm to optimize resource allocation in the SAGIN and aggregation weights in HFL. Moreover, we address the efficiency issue of hybrid action spaces in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) through a decoupling and recoupling approach, and design a new dynamic adjusting reward function to ensure fairness among multiple tasks in federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm, consistently outperforming baseline approaches and offering a promising solution for addressing highly complex optimization problems in SAGINs.</description>

      <title>The Role of Functional Muscle Networks in Improving Hand Gesture Perception for Human-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing accurate hand gesture perception models is critical for various robotic applications, enabling effective communication between humans and machines and directly impacting neurorobotics and interactive robots. Recently, surface electromyography (sEMG) has been explored for its rich informational context and accessibility when combined with advanced machine learning approaches and wearable systems. The literature presents numerous approaches to boost performance while ensuring robustness for neurorobots using sEMG, often resulting in models requiring high processing power, large datasets, and less scalable solutions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the decoding of muscle synchronization rather than individual muscle activation. We study coherence-based functional muscle networks as the core of our perception model, proposing that functional synchronization between muscles and the graph-based network of muscle connectivity encode contextual information about intended hand gestures. This can be decoded using shallow machine learning approaches without the need for deep temporal networks. Our technique could impact myoelectric control of neurorobots by reducing computational burdens and enhancing efficiency. The approach is benchmarked on the Ninapro database, which contains 12 EMG signals from 40 subjects performing 17 hand gestures. It achieves an accuracy of 85.1%, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods while requiring much less computational power. The results support the hypothesis that a coherence-based functional muscle network encodes critical information related to gesture execution, significantly enhancing hand gesture perception with potential applications for neurorobotic systems and interactive machines.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OTFS-Based Random Access for Cooperative LEO Satellite Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection for cooperative multi-satellite-enhanced random access, where orthogonal time-frequency space modulation with the large antenna array is utilized to combat the dynamics of the terrestrial-satellite links (TSLs). We introduce the generalized complex exponential basis expansion model to parameterize TSLs, thereby reducing the pilot overhead. By exploiting the block sparsity of the TSLs in the angular domain, a message passing algorithm is designed for initial channel estimation. Subsequently, we examine two cooperative modes to leverage the spatial diversity within satellite constellations: the centralized mode, where computations are performed at a high-power central server, and the distributed mode, where computations are offloaded to edge satellites with minimal signaling overhead. Specifically, in the centralized mode, device identification is achieved by aggregating backhaul information from edge satellites, and channel estimation and symbol detection are jointly enhanced through a structured approximate expectation propagation (AEP) algorithm. In the distributed mode, edge satellites share channel information and exchange soft information about data symbols, leading to a distributed version of AEP. The introduced basis expansion model for TSLs enables the efficient implementation of both centralized and distributed algorithms via fast Fourier transform. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed schemes significantly outperform conventional algorithms in terms of the activity error rate, the normalized mean squared error, and the symbol error rate. Notably, the distributed mode achieves performance comparable to the centralized mode with only two exchanges of soft information about data symbols within the constellation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As radar systems will be equipped with thousands of antenna elements and wide bandwidth, the associated costs and power consumption become exceedingly high, and a potential solution is to adopt low-resolution quantization technology, which not only reduces data storage needs but also lowers power and hardware costs. This paper focuses on line spectral estimation and detection (LSE\&amp;D) with few-bit ADCs (typically 1-4 bits) by investigating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss, establishing a framework to understand the impact of intersinusoidal interference, the bit-depth of the quantizer, and the noise variance on weak signal detection in scenarios involving multiple sinusoids under low-resolution quantization. Additionally, a low-complexity, super-resolution, and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm, named generalized Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (GNOMP), is proposed. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical findings, particularly in terms of the detection probability bound. The effectiveness of GNOMP is demonstrated through comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, the Cram\'{e}r Rao bound, and the detection probability bound. Real data acquired by mmWave radar further substantiates the effectiveness of GNOMP in practical applications.</description>

      <title>C-Band Lithium Niobate on Silicon Carbide SAW Resonator With Figure-of-Merit of 124 at 6.5 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a C-band shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) resonator with high electromechanical coupling (kt2) of 22% and a quality factor (Q) of 565 based on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on silicon carbide (SiC) platform, featuring an excellent figure-of-merit (FoM = kt2*Q ) of 124 at 6.5 GHz, the highest FoM reported in this frequency range. The resonator frequency upscaling is achieved through wavelength ($\lambda$) reduction and the use of thin aluminum (Al) electrodes. The LN/SiC waveguide and synchronous resonator design collectively enable effective acoustic energy confinement for a high FoM, even when the normalized thickness of LN approaches a scale of 0.5$\lambda$ to 1$\lambda$. To perform a comprehensive study, we also designed and fabricated five additional resonators, expending the $\lambda$ studied ranging from 480 to 800 nm, in the same 500 nm-thick transferred Y-cut thin-film LN on SiC. The fabricated SH-SAW resonators, operating from 5 to 8 GHz, experimentally demonstrate a kt2 from 20.3% to 22.9% and a Q from 350 to 575, thereby covering the entire C-band with excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Unified Integrated Sensing and Communication Signal Design: A Sphere Packing Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of communication signal sets is fundamentally a sphere packing problem. It aims to identify a set of M points in an N -dimensional space, with the objective of maximizing the separability of points that represent different bits.In contrast, signals used for sensing targets should ideally be asdeterministic as possible. This paper explores the inherent conflict and trade-off between communication and sensing when these functions are combined within the same signal set. We present a unified approach to signal design in the time, frequency, and space domains for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), framing it as a modified sphere packing problem. Through adept formula manipulation, this problem is transformed into a large-scale quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) challenge. We propose an augmented Lagrangian and dual ascent (ALDA) algorithm for iterative problem-solving. The computational complexity of this approach is analyzed and found to be daunting for large, high-dimensional signal set designs. To address this, we introduce a bit-dimension-power splitting (BDPS) method. This method decomposes the large-scale QCQP into a series of smaller-scale problems that can be solved more efficiently and in parallel, significantly reducing the overall computational load. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed signal design methods in the context of ISAC.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dynamic ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks: A Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is essential for enabling the vehicular networks. However, the communication channel in this scenario exhibits time-varying characteristics, and the potential targets may move rapidly, creating a doubly-dynamic phenomenon. This nature poses a challenge for real-time precoder design. While optimization-based solutions are widely researched, they are complex and heavily rely on perfect prior information, which is impractical in double dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose using constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) to facilitate dynamic updates to the ISAC precoder design. Additionally, the primal dual-deep deterministic policy gradient (PD-DDPG) and Wolpertinger architecture are tailored to efficiently train the algorithm under complex constraints and variable numbers of users. The proposed scheme not only adapts to the dynamics based on observations but also leverages environmental information to enhance performance and reduce complexity. Its superiority over existing candidates has been validated through experiments.</description>

Abstract: Exploring channel dimensions has been the driving force behind breakthroughs in successive generations of mobile communication systems. In 5G, space division multiple access (SDMA) leveraging massive MIMO has been crucial in enhancing system capacity through spatial differentiation of users. However, SDMA can only finely distinguish users at adjacent angles in ultra-dense networks by extremely large-scale antenna arrays. For a long time, most research has focused on the angle domain of the space, overlooking the potential of the distance domain. Near-field location division multiple access (LDMA) was proposed based on the beam-focusing effect yielded by near-field spherical propagation model, partitioning channel resources by both angle and distance. To achieve a similar idea in the far-field region, this paper introduces a far-field LDMA scheme for wideband systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Benefiting from frequency diverse arrays (FDA), it becomes possible to manipulate beams in the distance domain. Combined with OFDM, the inherent cyclic prefix ensures a complete OFDM symbol can be received without losing distance information, while the matched filter of OFDM helps eliminate the time-variance of FDA steering vectors. Theoretical and simulation results show that LDMA can fully exploit the additional degrees of freedom in the distance domain to significantly improve spectral efficiency, especially in narrow sector multiple access (MA) scenarios. Moreover, LDMA can maintain independence between array elements even in single-path channels, making it stand out in MA schemes at millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Mobile Tracking: A Framework of Using XL-RIS Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mobile tracking framework leveraging the high-dimensional signal received from extremely large-scale (XL) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). This received signal, named XL-RIS information, has a much larger data dimension and therefore offers a richer feature set compared to the traditional base station (BS) received signal, i.e., BS information, enabling more accurate tracking of mobile users (MUs). As the first step, we present an XL-RIS information reconstruction (XL-RIS-IR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-dimensional XL-RIS information from the low-dimensional BS information. Building on this, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for mobile tracking, consisting of a Feature Extraction Module and a Mobile Tracking Module. The Feature Extraction Module incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) extractor for spatial features, a time and frequency (T$\&amp;$F) extractor for domain features, and a near-field angles of arrival (AoAs) extractor for capturing AoA features within the XL-RIS. These features are combined into a comprehensive feature vector, forming a time-varying sequence fed into the Mobile Tracking Module, which employs an Auto-encoder (AE) with a stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) encoder and a standard LSTM decoder to predict MUs' positions in the upcoming time slot. Simulation results confirm that the tracking accuracy of our proposed framework is significantly enhanced by using reconstructed XL-RIS information and exhibits substantial robustness to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variations.</description>

      <title>The Family of LML Detectors and the Family of LAS Detectors for Massive MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of local maximum likelihood (LML) detectors and the family of likelihood ascent search (LAS) detectors are successfully applied to symbol detection in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications and demonstrate performance approaching the NP-hard global maximum likelihood (GML) detector. The LML and LAS detectors in the two families are akin to each other and possess common properties significant in both theory and practical MIMO communications. This book chapter reviews the LML and LAS detectors in a unified framework. The focus is on their formulation, relationships, properties, and GML performance in bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency in large MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Learning The Likelihood Test With One-Class Classifiers for Physical Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physical layer authentication (PLA) mechanisms, a verifier decides whether a received message has been transmitted by a legitimate user or an intruder, according to some features of the physical channel over which the message traveled. To design the authentication check implemented at the verifier, typically either the statistics or a dataset of features are available for the channel from the legitimate user, while no information is available when under attack. When the statistics are known, a well-known good solution is the likelihood test (LT). When a dataset is available, the decision problem is one-class classification (OCC) and a good understanding of the machine learning (ML) techniques used for its solution is important to ensure security. Thus, in this paper, we aim at obtaining ML PLA verifiers that operate as the LT. We show how to do it with the neural network (NN) and the one-class least-squares support vector machine (OCLSSVM) models, trained as two-class classifiers on the single-class dataset and an artificial dataset. The artificial dataset for the negative class is obtained by generating channel feature (CF) vectors uniformly distributed over the domain of the legitimate class dataset. We also derive a modified stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that trains a PLA verifier operating as LT without the need for the artificial dataset. Furthermore, we show that the one-class least-squares support vector machine with suitable kernels operates as the LT at convergence. Lastly, we show that the widely used autoencoder classifier generally does not provide the LT. Numerical results are provided considering PLA on both wireless and underwater acoustic channels.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time information exchange. However, due to the constraint on the maximum instantaneous power, guaranteeing bounded latency is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communication systems with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). Specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency communication systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain, we conduct an asymptotic analysis to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate and optimize the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communication systems adopting FBC, an EC-approximation method is conceived to derive the closed-form expression of that throughput. Our results may offer some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications, in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are crucial.</description>

      <title>VAE-IF: Deep feature extraction with averaging for fully unsupervised artifact detection in routinely acquired ICU time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artifacts are a common problem in physiological time series collected from intensive care units (ICU) and other settings. They affect the quality and reliability of clinical research and patient care. Manual annotation of artifacts is costly and time-consuming, rendering it impractical. Automated methods are desired. Here, we propose a novel fully unsupervised approach to detect artifacts in clinical-standard, minute-by-minute resolution ICU data without any prior labeling or signal-specific knowledge. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) and an isolation forest (IF) into a hybrid model to learn features and identify anomalies in different types of vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure. We evaluate our approach on a real-world ICU dataset and compare it with supervised benchmark models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and XGBoost and statistical methods such as ARIMA. We show that our unsupervised approach achieves comparable sensitivity to fully supervised methods and generalizes well to an external dataset. We also visualize the latent space learned by the VAE and demonstrate its ability to disentangle clean and noisy samples. Our approach offers a promising solution for cleaning ICU data in clinical research and practice without the need for any labels whatsoever.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</description>

      <title>Sky-GVIO: an enhanced GNSS/INS/Vision navigation with FCN-based sky-segmentation in urban canyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, continuous, and reliable positioning is a critical component of achieving autonomous driving. However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM. Additionally, the sky-view image dataset, inclusive of training and evaluation subsets, has been made publicly accessible for scholarly exploration at https://github.com/whuwangjr/sky-view-images .</description>

      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to achieve better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user using only the second-order Taylor expansion, which simplifies the problem-solving process compared to the existing two-step approximation method. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the existing two-step approximation method, achieving a 3.4% enhancement in max-min SNR. Moreover, it can improve the max-min SNR/SINR by up to 22.5%, 181.7%, and 343.9% compared to benchmarks employing only receive MAs, only transmit MAs, and both transmit and receive FPAs, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Near-Field Communications for Next-Generation Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>
