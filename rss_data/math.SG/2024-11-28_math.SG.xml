      <title>Periodic symplectic and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on irrational ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extension of homologically trivial symplectic or Hamiltonian cyclic actions to Hamiltonian circle actions on irrational ruled symplectic $4$-manifolds. On one hand, we construct symplectic involutions on minimal irrational ruled $4$-manifolds that cannot extend to a symplectic circle action even with a possibly different symplectic form. Higher dimensional examples are also constructed. On the other hand, for homologically trivial symplectic cyclic actions of any other order, we show that such an extension always exists.
  We also classify finite groups of symplecticmorphisms that acts trivially on the first homology group, and prove the non-extendability of the Klein $4$-group action to the three dimensional rotation group action motivated by the classification of finite groups of symplectomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The coisotropic embedding theorem for pre-symplectic vector spaces: an alternative proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative proof for the coisotropic embedding theorem for pre-symplectic vector spaces which is better suited to be generalized to the multisymplectic context.</description>

      <title>Essential loops in completions of Hamiltonian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the fundamental group of natural completions of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, namely its $C^0$-closure $\overline{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ and its completion with respect to the spectral norm $\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$. We prove that in some situations, namely complex projective spaces and rational Hirzebruch surfaces, certain Hamiltonian loops that were known to be non-trivial in $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)$ remain non-trivial in $\pi_1\big(\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)\big)$. This yields in particular cases, including $\mathbb C\mathrm P^2$ and the monotone $S^2\times S^2$, the injectivity of the map $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)\to\pi_1\big(\widehat{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)\big)$ induced by the inclusion. The same results hold for the Hofer completion of $\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)$. Moreover, whenever the spectral norm is known to be $C^0$-continuous, they also hold for $\overline{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$.
  Our method relies on computations of the valuation of Seidel elements and hence of the spectral norm on $\pi_1\big(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega)\big)$. Some of these computations were known before, but we also present new ones which might be of independent interest. For example, we show that the spectral pseudo-norm is degenerate when $(M,\omega)$ is any non-monotone $S^{2}\times S^{2}$. At the contrary, it is a genuine norm when $M$ is the 1-point blow-up of $\mathbb C\mathrm P^{2}$; it is unbounded for small sizes of the blow-up and become bounded starting at the monotone one.</description>

      <title>Skein valued cluster transformation in enumerative geometry of Legendrian mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain hypotheses, we show that Legendrian surfaces related by disk surgery will have q-deformed augmentation spaces that are related by q-deformed cluster transformation. The proof is geometric, via considerations of moduli of holomorphic curves. In fact, our results naturally give a more general HOMFLYPT "skein-valued cluster transformation", of which the q-cluster transformation is the U(1) specialization.
  We apply our methods to the Legendrians associated to cubic planar graphs, where mutation of graphs lifts to Legendrian disk surgery. We show that their skein-valued mirrors transform by skein-valued cluster transformation, and give a formula for the skein-valued curve counts on their fillings.</description>
