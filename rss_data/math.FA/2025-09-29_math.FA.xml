      <title>Multiplicative trace and spectrum preservers on stochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize maps $\phi_i: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}$, $i=1, \ldots, m$ and $m\ge 1$, that have the multiplicative spectrum or trace preserving property:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  \textrm{spec} (\phi_1(A_1)\cdots \phi_m(A_m)) &amp;=&amp; \textrm{spec} (A_1\cdots A_m),\quad\text{or}\quad
  \textrm{tr} (\phi_1(A_1)\cdots \phi_m(A_m)) &amp;=&amp; \textrm{tr} (A_1\cdots A_m),
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of $n\times n$ doubly stochastic, row stochastic, or column stochastic matrices, or the space spanned by one of these sets.
  Linearity is assumed when $m=1$. We show that every stochastic matrix contains a real doubly stochastic component that carries the spectral information.
  In consequence, the multiplicative spectrum or trace preservers on these sets $ \mathcal{S} $ are linked to the
  corresponding preservers on the space of doubly stochastic matrices.
  Moreover, when $m\ge 3$, multiplicative trace preservers always coincide with multiplicative spectrum preservers.</description>

      <title>On stability of triangular factorization of positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak f=\{\mathscr F_s\}_{s&gt;0}$ be a nest and $C$ a bounded positive operator in a Hilbert space $\mathscr F$. The representation $C=V^*V$ provided $V\mathscr F_s\subset\mathscr F_s$ is a triangular factorization (TF) of $C$ w.r.t. $\mathfrak f$. The factorization is stable if $C^\alpha\underset{\alpha\to\infty}\to C$ and $C^\alpha=V^{\alpha\,*}V^\alpha$ implies $V^\alpha\to V$. If $C$ is positive definite (isomorphism), then TF is stable. The paper deals with the case of positive but not positive definite $C$. We impose some assumptions on $C^\alpha$ and $C$ which provide the stability of TF.</description>

      <title>A hybrid scheme for fixed points of a countable family of generalized non-expansive-type maps and generalized mixed equilibrium problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty closed and convex subset of a uniformly smooth and uniformly convex real Banach space $\mathcal{X}$ with dual space $\mathcal{X}^*$. This article presents a hybrid algorithm for finding a common element of the set of solutions to a generalized mixed equilibrium problem and the set of common fixed points of a family of a general class of nonlinear nonexpansive maps. The results obtained were employed to study optimization problem. Our results and its applications complement, generalize, and extend several results in literature.</description>

      <title>On a class of m-Isometric and Quasi-m-isometric operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize $m$-isometric and quasi-$m$-isometric weighted conditional type (WCT) operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)$. Also, we prove that the subclasses of $m$-isometric and quasi-$m$-isometric of normal WCT operators are coincide. Specially we have the results for multiplication operators. Indeed, we find that for $m\geq 2$, a multiplication operator $M_u$ is $m$-isometric (quasi-$m$-isometric) if and only if it is isometric (quasi-isometric). Some examples are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>On the equivalent Zb\v{a}ganu constant associated with isosceles orthogonality in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates a new geometric constant associated with isosceles orthogonality in Banach spaces. By establishing the connection between this new constant and a classical function, sharp upper and lower bounds for the constant are derived. Specifically, the space is exactly a Hilbert space when the new constant reaches its lower bound; in finite-dimensional spaces, if the new constant attains its upper bound, it implies that the space does not possess uniform non-squareness.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative localizations and joint spectra of a contractive quantum plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate the localizations in the sense of J. L. Taylor of the Arens-Michael-Fr\'echet algebras occurred within the formal geometry of a contractive q-plane. It turns out that all noncommutative Fr\'echet algebras obtained by the Fr\'echet sheaves of the formal geometry are indeed localizations. That topological homology property of the structure sheaf results in the key properties of Taylor and Putinar spectra of the Banach q-modules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the positively 1-complemented subspaces of $S^p$, for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, where $S^p$ denotes the Schatten spaces. Building on the work of Arazy and Friedman, who described the 1-complemented subspaces of $S^p$, for $1\leq p\neq 2 &lt;\infty$, we establish that there are five mutually distinct types of indecomposable positively 1-complemented subspaces in $S^p$. Moreover, every positively 1-complemented subspace of $S^p$ can be expressed as a direct sum of some of these indecomposable subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Twisted crossed products of Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a locally compact group $G$, a nondegenerate Banach algebra $A$ with a contractive approximate identity, a twisted action $(\alpha, \sigma)$ of $G$ on $A$, and a family $\mathcal{R}$ of uniformly bounded representations of $A$ on Banach spaces, we define the twisted crossed product $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$. When $\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property.
  As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is "stably" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.</description>

      <title>Canonical Wiener-Hopf factorization on the unit circle: matching subspaces versus Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wiener-Hopf factorization is an important tool in the study of block Toeplitz and block Wiener-Hopf operators, and many applications involving these operators. In this paper we compare two approaches to Wiener-Hopf factorization, namely, the more classical approach based on matching invariant subspaces and a more recent approach based on solutions to a non-symmetric Riccati equation. The latter approach is extended to the case of Hilbert space operator-valued functions that are analytic on a neighborhood of the unit disc $\BT$, but need not be rational. In both approaches, existence of canonical right Wiener-Hopf factorization is characterized by existence of a stabilizing solution to a Riccati equation, however, the Riccati equations are not the same. We analyse the solution sets of the Riccati equations and show that they indeed are not the same, but they do have the same stabilizing solution.</description>

      <title>General Riemann Integration on Partially Ordered Net Convergence Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a general theory of integration of the Riemann type with respect to arbitrary measures and functions, connected by a continuous bilinear product, with values in abstract Riesz spaces endowed with a general convergence given by nets. This covers both the topological and order based convergences in the literature. We then show that this integral satisfies most of the common order based properties of the objects that comprises integration theory. By establishing a generalized notion of summability on Riesz spaces and an integral build upon countable partitions of the base space and the summability theory, we then shown some uniform convergence theorems for the refereed integrals. An application of these theorems is made to prove various equivalences concerning the Lebesgue, for which we give a brief survey, and Riemann type integrals in partially ordered spaces defined previously. We finish the article with a possible way of classifying general integration procedures defined in abstract convergence structures, and pose some open problems based on them.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce fractal interpolation on complete semi-vector spaces. This approach is motivated by the requirements of preservation of positivity or monotonicity of functions for some models in approximation and interpolation theory. The setting in complete semi-vector spaces does not requite additional assumptions but is intrinsically built into the frame work. For the purposes of this paper, fractal interpolation in the complete semi-vector spaces $C^+$ and $L_p^+$ is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the problem of modifying the subspaces of a fusion frame in order to construct a Parseval fusion frame. In this respect, the notion of scalability is extended to the fusion frame setting. Then, scalable fusion Riesz bases are characterized, and a concrete form for scalable 1-excess fusion frames is obtained. Furthermore, it is shown that 1-excess dual fusion frames of a fusion Riesz basis are not scalable. Finally, several examples are exhibited to confirm the acquired results.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Spaces: Replacing Fuzzy Metrics with the Hilbert Space Structure of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy metric spaces, grounded in t-norms and membership functions, have been widely proposed to model uncertainty in machine learning, decision systems, and artificial intelligence. Yet these frameworks treat uncertainty as an external layer of imprecision imposed upon classical, point-like entities - a conceptual mismatch for domains where indeterminacy is intrinsic, such as quantum systems or cognitive representations. We argue that fuzzy metrics are unnecessary for modeling such uncertainty: instead, the well-established structure of complex Hilbert spaces - the foundational language of quantum mechanics for over a century - provides a natural, rigorous, and non-contradictory metric space where the ``points'' are quantum states themselves. The distance between states is given by the Hilbert norm, which directly encodes state distinguishability via the Born rule. This framework inherently captures the non-classical nature of uncertainty without requiring fuzzy logic, t-norms, or membership degrees. We demonstrate its power by modeling AI concepts as Gaussian wavefunctions and classifying ambiguous inputs via quantum overlap integrals. Unlike fuzzy methods, our approach naturally handles interference, distributional shape, and concept compositionality through the geometry of state vectors. We conclude that fuzzy metric spaces, while historically useful, are obsolete for representing intrinsic uncertainty - superseded by the more robust, predictive, and ontologically coherent framework of quantum state geometry.</description>

      <title>Robin Problems of Elliptic Equations on Rough Domains: H\"older Regularity, Green's Functions, and Harmonic Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ and $s\in (n-2,n)$. Assume that $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a one-sided bounded non-tangentially accessible domain with $s$-Ahlfors regular boundary and $\sigma$ is the surface measure on the boundary of $\Omega$, denoted by $\partial \Omega$. Let $\beta$ be a non-negative measurable function on $\partial \Omega$ satisfying $\beta\in L^{q_0}(\partial \Omega,\sigma)~\text{with}~ q_0 \in(\frac{s}{s+2-n},\infty]~\text{and}\ \beta\ge a_0~\text{on}~E_0\subset \partial \Omega, $ where $a_0$ is a given positive constant and $E_0\subset \partial \Omega$ is a $\sigma$-measurable set with $\sigma(E_0)&gt;0$. In this article, for any $f\in L^p(\partial \Omega,\sigma)$ with $p\in(s/(s+2-n),\infty]$, we obtain the existence and uniqueness, the global H\"older regularity, and the boundary Harnack inequality of the weak solution to the Robin problem $$\begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u) = 0~~&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ A\nabla u\cdot \boldsymbol{\nu}+\beta u = f~~&amp;\text{on}~\partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where the coefficient matrix $A$ is real-valued, bounded and measurable and satisfies the uniform ellipticity condition and where $\boldsymbol{\nu}$ denotes the outward unit normal to $\partial\Omega$. Furthermore, we establish the existence, upper bound pointwise estimates, and the H\"older regularity of Green's functions associated with this Robin problem. As applications, we further prove that the harmonic measure associated with this Robin problem is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure $\sigma$ and also provide a quantitative characterization of mutual absolute continuity at small scales. These results extend the corresponding results established by David et al. [arXiv: 2410.23914] via weakening their assumption that $\beta$ is a given positive constant.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Markovian Couplings of Levy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal Markovian coupling problem for two Pi-valued Feller processes {X_t} and {Y_t}, which seeks a coupling process {(X_t, Y_t)} that minimizes the right derivative at t = 0 of the expected cost E^{(x,y)}[c(X_t, Y_t)], for all initial states (x,y) in Pi^2 and a given cost function c on Pi. This problem was first formulated and solved by Chen (1994) for drift-diffusion processes and later extended by Zhang (2000) to Markov processes with bounded jumps. In this work, we resolve the case of Levy processes under the quadratic cost c(x,y) = 1/2 |x - y|^2 by introducing a new formulation of the "Levy optimal transport problem" between Levy measures. We show that the resulting optimal coupling process {(X_t*, Y_t*)}_{t &gt;= 0} satisfies a minimal growth property: for each t &gt;= 0 and x,y in R^d, the expectation E^{(x,y)}|X_t* - Y_t*|^2 is minimized among all Feller couplings. A key feature of our approach is the development of a dual problem, expressed as a variational principle over test functions of the generators. We prove strong duality for this formulation, thereby closing the optimality gap. As a byproduct, we obtain a Wasserstein-type metric on the space of Levy generators and Levy measures with finite second moment, and establish several of its fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova Formula in (Fractional) Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, of nonlocal functionals $$ \mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u) = \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}^N}
  \rho_{\varepsilon}(y-x)\,|u(x)-u(y)|^p\,dx\,dy,\qquad u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^N),\quad 1\leqslant p&lt;\infty, $$ associated with a general family of nonnegative measurable kernels $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$. Our primary aim is to single out the weakest moment-type assumptions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ that are necessary and sufficient for the pointwise convergence $$ \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u)=2\|u\|_{L^p}^p $$ to hold for every $u$ in a prescribed subspace of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In the canonical smooth regime of compactly supported functions ($u\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$) we show that convergence occurs when two optimal conditions are satisfied: (i) a mass-escape condition, and (ii) a short-range attenuation effect, expressed by the vanishing as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the kernels' $p$-moments in any fixed neighborhood of the origin. This general framework recovers the classical Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova theorem for fractional-type kernels and extends the convergence result to a much broader class of interaction profiles, which may be non-symmetric and non-homogeneous. Using a density argument that preserves the moment assumptions, we prove that the same necessary and sufficient conditions remain valid in the integer-order Sobolev setting ($u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$). Finally, by adapting the method to fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $s\in(0,1)$, we recover the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova formula and extend it under analogous abstract conditions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact Abelian group with a fixed Haar measure and, denote by $\widehat{G}$ its dual group. In this article, the authors obtain various boundedness of the short-time Fourier transform on Lorentz spaces: $$L^{p_1,u}(G)\times L^{p_2,v}(G)\to L^{q,w}(G\times\widehat{G})$$ with the indexes satisfying appropriate relations. These results are then used to prove the corresponding boundedness of $\tau$-Wigner transforms and $\tau$-Weyl operators. As an application, the Lieb's uncertainty principle in the context of Lorentz spaces is finally investigated. All these results are new even for the case when $G$ is finite.</description>

      <title>Relative higher index theory on quotients of Roe algebras and positive scalar curvature at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ quotients of Roe algebras as index containers for elliptic differential operators to study the existence problem of Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature on non-compact complete Riemannian manifolds. The non-vanishing of such an index locates the precise direction at infinity of the obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and may be viewed as a refinement of the positive scalar curvature problem. To achieve this, we formulate the relative coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the relative coarse Novikov conjecture, together with their maximal versions, for general metric spaces as a program to compute the $K$-theory of the quotients of the Roe algebras relative to specific ideals. We show that if the metric space admits a relative fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space or an $\ell^p$-space, certain cases of these conjectures can be verified, which yield obstructions to the existence of uniformly positive scalar curvature metrics in specified directions at infinity. As an application, we prove that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for finite products of certain expander graphs that fail to admit fibred coarse embeddings into Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Capacitary Muckenhoupt Weights and Weighted Norm Inequalities for Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal H_{\infty}^\delta$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in(0,n]$ defined on subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. The principal problem, considered in this paper, is to characterize the non-negative function $w$ for which the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality on Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators associated with Hausdorff contents hold true. To achieve this, we introduce a class of capacitary Muckenhoupt weights depending on the dimension $\delta$, denoted as $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, which enjoys the strict monotonicity on the dimension index $\delta$. Then we show that, for any $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$, the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{1,\delta}$ by a new approach developed in this paper. As the second objective, applying this new approach, the seminal properties of classical Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights, such as the reverse H\"older inequality (R. R. Coifman and C. Fefferman, Studia Math. 51 (1974), 241-250), the self-improving property (B. Muckenhoupt, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 165 (1972), 207-226), and the Jones factorization theorem (P. W. Jones, Ann. of Math. (2) 111 (1980), 511-530), are all established within the framework of capacitary Muckenhoupt weight class $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$. Finally, we also show that the maximal operator is bounded on the weak weighted Choquet-Lebesgue space $L_w^{p,\infty}(\mathbb R^n,{\mathcal H}_\infty^\delta)$ if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$ with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a torus of arbitrary dimension, it is conjectured that Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are observable from any space-time set of positive Lebesgue measure. We establish a criterion that proves the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus, yields new examples of measurable observation sets, and, more significantly, reduces the general conjecture to verifying certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give an overview on known as well as new results on the boundedness of the $H^{\infty}$-calculus of the Stokes operator in rough as well as in unbounded (smoother) domains. We present a special case of an abstract comparison principle due to Kunstmann and Weis (\cite{KuW:Hinfty-Stokes}) that serves as the basis for all considerations. Subsequently, we show how this result can be applied to arrive at a bounded $H^{\infty}$-calculus for the Stokes operator. We sketch the proof for no slip boundary conditions in bounded Lipschitz domains which was given in~\cite{KuW:Hinfty-Stokes}. For unbounded domains this approach yields a shorter proof compared to previous arguments. Moreover, we further establish the boundedness of the $H^{\infty}$-calculus for the Stokes operator with Neumann type boundary conditions in bounded convex domains which is entirely new.</description>

      <title>On domains of elliptic operators with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show how one can use recently gained insights from the study of singular SPDEs, more particularly the study of singular operators via the theory of Paracontrolled Distributions, to construct domains for (singular) elliptic operators. Formally we consider \[ A (u) \text{"$=$''} (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V \cdot \nabla u + \xi u +
  {{div} (\rho u)}, \] where $V \in \mathcal{C}^{\delta}$, $\xi \in \mathcal{C}^{- 2 + \delta}$, $\rho \in \mathcal{C}^{- 1 + \delta},{div}\rho = 0$ and which satisfy a structural assumption that is notably satisfied when $\xi$ is a "sub-critical noise". We also show that under this assumption, one can construct a continuous change of variables $\Theta$ which satisfies \[ A \Theta - (1 - \Delta) \in \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; H^{\delta'}) \] which allows us to define $A$ rigorously and parametrise a domain. Moreover, for suitably regularised operators \[ A_{\varepsilon} (u) := (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V_{\varepsilon} \cdot
  \nabla u + (\xi_{\varepsilon} + c_{\varepsilon}) u +
  {{div} (\rho_{\varepsilon} \cdot u)}, \] we show that for a strongly converging regularised change of variables $\Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow \Theta$ we have \[ A_{\varepsilon} \Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow A \Theta \text{ in }
  \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; L^2) \] which in particular implies norm resolvent convergence to a limiting closed operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that a commuting family of contractions possesses a regular unitary dilation if and only if it satisfies Brehmer's positivity condition. We extend this theorem to any family $\mathcal T$ of $q$-commuting contractions with $\|q\|=1$ by showing the equivalence of the following three statements: $(i)$ $\mathcal T$ admits a regular $q$-unitary dilation; $(ii)$ $\mathcal T$ satisfies Brehmer's positivity condition; $(iii)$ $\mathcal T$ admits a $Q$-unitary dilation for a family of $Q$-commuting unitaries. We achieve the first part of the result by an application of Stinespring's dilation theorem on a particular completely positive map acting on a quotient algebra of a group $C^*$-algebra, where the underlying group is a free group, and the second part is obtained by an application of Naimark's theorem. Next, we find several cases when $\mathcal{T}$ admits a regular $q$-unitary dilation and establish a von Neumann type inequality for such a $q$-commuting family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,d)$ be a uniformly locally finite metric space, and $T$ an operator in the uniform Roe algebra $C_u^*(X)$ (or uniform quasi-local algebra $C_{ql}^*(X)$). In this paper, we introduce the concept of limit operators of $T$ on galaxies in the nonstandard extension of $X$, and prove that $T$ is a generalized Fredholm operator with respect to the ghost ideal in $C_u^*(X)$ (or $C_{ql}^*(X)$) if and only if all limit operators on afar galaxies are invertible, and their inverses are uniformly bounded. In particular, if $X$ has Yu's Property A, then $T$ is a Fredholm operator if and only if all limit operators on afar galaxies are invertible. Using techniques in nonstandard analysis, our result strengthens a work of \v{S}pakula--Willett \cite{SpW} on the characterization of Fredholmness by using less limit operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that if a Fourier multiplier is continuous from $L^{\Phi_1}$ to $L^{\Phi_2}$, then it is also continuous from $M^{\Phi_1,\Psi}$ to $M^{\Phi_2,\Psi}$, where $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\Psi$ are quasi-Young functions and $\Phi_1$ fulfills the $\Delta_2$-condition. This result is applied to show that Mihlin's Fourier multiplier theorem and H\"ormander's improvement hold in certain Orlicz modulation spaces. Lastly, we show that the Fourier multiplier with symbol $m(\xi) = e^{i \mu(\xi)}$, where $\mu$ is homogeneous of order $\alpha$, is bounded on quasi-Banach Orlicz modulation spaces of order $r$, assuming $r\in\big(d/(d+2),1\big]$ and $\alpha\in\big(d(1-r)/r, 2\big]$.</description>

Abstract: Coorbit spaces provide a rigorous framework for the assessment of the approximation theoretic properties of generalized wavelet systems. It is therefore useful to understand when two different wavelet systems give rise to the same scales of coorbit spaces. This paper provides an exhaustive answer to this question for the case of continuous wavelet transforms associated with matrix groups in dimension two.</description>

      <title>A geometrical approach to the sharp Hardy inequality in Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a partial negative answer to a question left open in a previous work by Brasco and the first and third-named authors concerning the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality on convex sets. Our approach has a geometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the limit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the Lebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower bounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex sets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.</description>

      <title>BIBO stability of 1-D hyperbolic boundary control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the question of bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of a class of 1-D hyperbolic boundary control systems, which, in particular, contains distributed port-Hamiltonian systems. Exploiting the particular structure of the transfer function of these systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for BIBO stability.</description>

      <title>Discarding Lavrentiev's Gap in Non-autonomous and Non-Convex Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\,dx \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, \(\Omega\) is a bounded Lipschitz open set in \(\rn\), \(N\geq 1\) and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spatial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and convex with respect to the last variable. Under these assumptions alone, Lavrentiev gaps may occur, as illustrated by classical examples in the literature. We identify an additional natural condition on $f$ to discard such phenomena, that can be interpreted as a balance between the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. This unifies most of the structural assumptions that have been introduced so far to prevent the occurence of Lavrentiev gaps. Remarkably, typical assumptions that are usually imposed on $f$ in this setting are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps on real $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the general properties and structure of $C^*$-extreme points within the $C^*$-convex set $\mathrm{UCP}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$ of all unital completely positive (UCP) maps from a unital real $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ to the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of all bounded real linear maps on a real Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. We analyze the differences in the structure of $C^*$-extreme points between the real and complex $C^*$-algebra cases. In particular, we show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a UCP map between matrix algebras to be a $C^*$-extreme point are identical in both the real and complex matrix algebra cases. We also observe significant differences in the structure of $C^*$-extreme points when $\mathcal{A}$ is a commutative real $C^*$-algebra compared to when $\mathcal{A}$ is a commutative complex $C^*$-algebra. We provide a complete classification of the $C^*$-extreme points of $\mathrm{UCP}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital commutative real $C^*$-algebra and $\mathcal{H}$ is a finite-dimensional real Hilbert space. As an application, we classify all $C^*$-extreme points in the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive skew-symmetric real matrices in $M_n(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Bimodule Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of bimodule quantum Markov semigroups within the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. Building on the structure of quantum symmetries, we introduce the concepts of bimodule equilibrium and bimodule detailed balance conditions, which not only generalize the classical notions of equilibrium and detailed balance but also expose interesting structures of quantum channels. We demonstrate that the evolution of densities governed by the bimodule quantum Markov semigroup is the bimodule gradient flow for the relative entropy with respect to quantum symmetries. Consequently, we obtain bimodule logarithmic Sobelov inequalities and bimodule Talagrand inequality with respect to a hidden density from higher dimensional structure. Furthermore, we establish a bimodule Poincar\'{e} inequality for irreducible inclusions and relative ergodic bimodule quantum semigroups.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of weighted shifts on sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by three recent open questions in the study of linear dynamics, we study weighted shifts on sequence spaces. First, we provide an example of a weighted shift on a locally convex space whose topology is generated by a sequence of complete seminorms which is generalized hyperbolic, but does not have the shadowing property. Next, we characterise uniform topological expansivity on Fr\'echet spaces satisfying some very natural conditions. Finally, we study the periodic shadowing property on normed spaces leading to a condition formulated purely in terms of weights which we show is necessary for the periodic shadowing property on $\ell_p$ and equivalent on $c_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the conjectured capillary Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality holds for any unconditional, strictly convex capillary hypersurface when $\theta \in \left(0, \tfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$. Moreover, for $\theta \in \left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}, \pi\right)$, we show that the capillary volume product has no finite upper bound.</description>
