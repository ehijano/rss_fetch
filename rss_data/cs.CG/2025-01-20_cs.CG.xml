      <title>Higher Order Continuity for Smooth As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modification of the As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) mesh deformation energy with higher order smoothness, which overcomes a prominent limitation of the original ARAP formulation: spikes and lack of continuity at the manipulation handles. Our method avoids spikes even when using single-point positional constraints. Since no explicit rotations have to be specified, the user interaction can be realized through a simple click-and-drag interface, where points on the mesh can be selected and moved around while the rest of the mesh surface automatically deforms accordingly. Our method preserves the benefits of ARAP deformations: it is easy to implement and thus useful for practical applications, while its efficiency makes it usable in real-time, interactive scenarios on detailed models.</description>

      <title>A rigid origami elliptic-hyperbolic vertex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of rigid origami concerns the folding of stiff, inelastic plates of material along crease lines that act like hinges and form a straight-line planar graph, called the crease pattern of the origami. Crease pattern vertices in the interior of the folded material and that are adjacent to four crease lines, i.e. degree-4 vertices, have a single degree of freedom and can be chained together to make flexible polyhedral surfaces. Degree-4 vertices that can fold to a completely flat state have folding kinematics that are very well-understood, and thus they have been used in many engineering and physics applications. However, degree-4 vertices that are not flat-foldable or not folded from flat paper so that the vertex forms either an elliptic or hyperbolic cone, have folding angles at the creases that follow more complicated kinematic equations. In this work we present a new duality between general degree-4 rigid origami vertices, where dual vertices come in elliptic-hyperbolic pairs that have essentially equivalent kinematics. This reveals a mathematical structure in the space of degree-4 rigid origami vertices that can be leveraged in applications, for example in the construction of flexible 3D structures that possess metamaterial properties.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of minimum-area rectilinear convex hull under rotation and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.10888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We compute the value of $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ for which the rectilinear convex hull of $P$, denoted by $\mathcal{RH}_\theta(P)$, has minimum (or maximum) area in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, improving the previous $O(n^2)$ bound. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a set of $k$ lines through the origin sorted by slope and let $\alpha_i$ be the sizes of the $2k$ angles defined by pairs of two consecutive lines, $i=1, \ldots , 2k$. Let $\Theta_{i}=\pi-\alpha_i$ and $\Theta=\min\{\Theta_i \colon i=1,\ldots,2k\}$. We obtain: (1) Given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we provide an algorithm to compute the $\mathcal{O}$-convex hull of $P$ in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space; If $\Theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$, the time and space complexities are $O(\frac{n}{\Theta}\log n)$ and $O(\frac{n}{\Theta})$ respectively. (2) Given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we compute and maintain the boundary of the ${\mathcal{O}}_{\theta}$-convex hull of $P$ for $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ in $O(kn\log n)$ time and $O(kn)$ space, or if $\Theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$, in $O(k\frac{n}{\Theta}\log n)$ time and $O(k\frac{n}{\Theta})$ space. (3) Finally, given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we compute, in $O(kn\log n)$ time and $O(kn)$ space, the angle $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ such that the $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$-convex hull of $P$ has minimum (or maximum) area over all $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of Steiner Tree in $\ell_p$-metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Continuous Steiner Tree problem (CST), we are given as input a set of points (called terminals) in a metric space and ask for the minimum-cost tree connecting them. Additional points (called Steiner points) from the metric space can be introduced as nodes in the solution. In the Discrete Steiner Tree problem (DST), we are given in addition to the terminals, a set of facilities, and any solution tree connecting the terminals can only contain the Steiner points from this set of facilities.
  Trevisan [SICOMP'00] showed that CST and DST are APX-hard when the input lies in the $\ell_1$-metric (and Hamming metric). Chleb\'ik and Chleb\'ikov\'a [TCS'08] showed that DST is NP-hard to approximate to factor of $96/95\approx 1.01$ in the graph metric (and consequently $\ell_\infty$-metric). Prior to this work, it was unclear if CST and DST are APX-hard in essentially every other popular metric.
  In this work, we prove that DST is APX-hard in every $\ell_p$-metric. We also prove that CST is APX-hard in the $\ell_{\infty}$-metric. Finally, we relate CST and DST, showing a general reduction from CST to DST in $\ell_p$-metrics.</description>

      <title>BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</description>
