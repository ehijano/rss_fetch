      <title>Uniform Property (S)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a quantitative version of Steinhaus' property $(S)$ for Banach spaces, called the uniform property $(S)$. A Banach space $X$ is said to have uniform $(S)$ if for every pair of distinct unit vectors $x,y\in X$ and every $a&gt;0$, the difference of the perturbed norms \[
  \sup_{\|z\|\le a}\big|\|x+z\|-\|y+z\|\big| \] is bounded below by a positive function of $a$ and $\|x-y\|$. We compute this modulus exactly for the spaces $L_1(\mu)$ with atomless measure $\mu$, \[
  U_{L_1(\mu)}(d;a)=\Big(\tfrac{4a}{2+d}\wedge 1\Big)d, \] The class of spaces with uniform $(S)$ is stable under ultrapowers, Bochner-$L_1$ constructions, and contains all Gurari\u{\i} spaces as well as Banach lattices of almost universal disposition. In particular, every Banach space embeds isometrically into a non-strictly convex Banach space of the same density having uniform $(S)$. We further exhibit an explicit equivalent renorming of $\ell_1(\Gamma)$, \[
  \|x\|_S=\big(\|x\|_1^2+\|x\|_2^2\big)^{1/2}, \] which endows $\ell_1(\Gamma)$ and all its ultrapowers with uniform $(S)$. These results settle, in ZFC, several open questions about the quantitative geometry of property $(S)$ posed by Kochanek and the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Counting spaces of functions on separable compact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following general problem, closely related to the problem of isomorphic classification of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on a compact space $K$, equipped with the standard supremum norm:Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a class of compact spaces. How many isomorphism types of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of real-valued continuous functions on $K$ are there, for $K\in \mathcal{K}$?
  We prove that for any uncountable regular cardinal number $\kappa$, there exist exactly $2^\kappa$ isomorphism types of spaces $C(K)$ for compact spaces of weight $\kappa$.
  We show that, for the class $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1}$ of separable compact linearly ordered spaces of weight $\omega_1$, the answer to the above question depends on additional set-theoretic axioms. In particular, assuming the continuum hypothesis, there are $2^{2^\omega}$ isomorphism types of $C(L)$, for $L\in \mathcal{L_{\omega_1}}$, and assuming a certain axiom proposed by Baumgartner, there is only one type.</description>

      <title>Non-absolute integration and application to Young geometric integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey several non-absolutely convergent integrals, including the Henstock-Kurzweil and Pfeffer integrals, and use ideas from these theories to investigate the problem of multidimensional Young integration. We further present results on Young geometric integration, namely the integration of certain generalized differential forms over $m$-dimensional subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. This is achieved by introducing appropriate notions of chains and cochains, in the spirit of Whitney's geometric integration theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical range and Berezin range of weighted composition operators on weighted Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical ranges of weighted composition operators on weighted Dirichlet spaces, focusing on the properties of the inducing functions. We identify conditions on these functions under which the origin lies in the interior of the numerical range. The geometric structure of the numerical range is also analyzed, determining when it contains a circular or elliptical disc and computing the corresponding radius. Next, we introduce a class of Weyl-type weighted composition operators and obtain their Berezin range and Berezin number. Finally, we characterize the convexity of the Berezin range for weighted composition operators on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Arazy-type decomposition theorem for bounded linear operators and commutators on the trace class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Arazy's decomposition theorem provides a powerful tool in the study of sequences in (and isomorphisms on) a separable operator ideal $\mathcal C_E$ of the algebra $\mathcal B(H)$ of all bounded linear operators on the separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $H$. In this paper, we extend and strengthen Arazy's decomposition theorem to the setting of general bounded linear operators on a separable (quasi-Banach) operator ideal $\mathcal C_E$ of $\mathcal B(H)$. Several applications are given to the study of $\mathcal C_E$-strictly singular operators, largest proper ideals in the algebra $\mathcal B(\mathcal C_E)$ of all bounded linear operators on $\mathcal C_E$ and complementably homogeneous Banach spaces among others. Our versions of decomposition theorems supply tools for a noncommutative generalization of deep commutator theorems for operators on $\ell_p$ and $L_p$, $1\le p &lt;\infty $, due to Brown and Pearcy, Apostol, and Dosev, Johnson and Schechtman. We are able to characterize commutators on the Schatten-von Neumann class $\mathcal C_p$, $1\le p&lt;\infty $. For the crucial case, $p=1$, we establish that any operator $T\in\mathcal B(\mathcal C_1)$ is a commutator if and only if $T$ is not of the form $\lambda I+K$ for some $\lambda\neq 0$ and $\mathcal C_1$-strictly singular operator $K$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous maximizers of the Blaschke--Santalo-type functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Blaschke--Santal{\'o}-type inequalities for $N \ge 2$ sets (functions) and a special class of cost functions. In particular, we prove new results about reduction of the maximization problem for the Blaschke--Santal{\'o}-type functional to homogeneous case (functional inequalities on the sphere) and extend the symmetrization argument to the case of $N &gt; 2$ sets.
  We also discuss links to the multimagrinal optimal transportation problem and the related sharp transportation-information inequalities.</description>

      <title>An Extension and Refinement of the Brouwer-Schauder-Tychonoff Fixed Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Brouwer-Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem on locally convex spaces as the following extension and improvement:
  Suppose that S is a compact star-shaped subset with respect to p in S with its convexity index alpha(p)&gt;0. Then every continuous self-mapping f has one of the following two properties:
  (a) The point p is a fixed point of f;
  (b) f has uncountably many different eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
  Note that a closed bounded star-shaped set in a locally convex space is convex if and only if alpha=1, and we extend a Brouwer's type fixed-point theorem on compact star-shaped sets in Banach spaces in a more concise manner to locally convex spaces, thereby this is a simplification and an improvement of the Tychonoff fixed-point theorem to compact star-shaped sets.</description>

      <title>One-Sided and Parabolic BLO Spaces with Time Lag and Their Applications to Muckenhoupt $A_1$ Weights and Doubly Nonlinear Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the one-sided BLO space $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ and characterize it, respectively, in terms of the one-sided Muckenhoupt class $A_1^+(\mathbb{R})$ and the one-sided John--Nirenberg inequality. Using these, we establish the Coifman--Rochberg type decomposition of $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and show that $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ is independent of the distance between the two intervals, which further induces the characterization of this space in terms of the one-sided BMO space $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ (the Bennett type lemma). As applications, we prove that any $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ function can split into the sum of two $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and we provide an explicit description of the distance from $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions to $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Finally, as a higher-dimensional analogue we introduce the parabolic BLO space $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ with time lag, and we extend all the above one-dimensional results to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$; furthermore, as applications, we not only establish the relationships between $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ and the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations, but also provide a necessary condition for the negative logarithm of the parabolic distance function to belong to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ in terms of the weak porosity of the set.</description>

      <title>Commutators of Fractional Integrals with $\operatorname{BMO}^\beta$ Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study commutators of the Riesz potential $I_\alpha$ with functions $b$ in the capacitary space $\mathrm{BMO}^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$, defined through the Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}^\beta_\infty$. We prove a Chanillo-type theorem characterising $\mathrm{BMO}^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$ via the boundedness of the commutator $[b,I_\alpha]$ on capacitary Lebesgue spaces. In addition, we obtain the endpoint estimate in the form of a capacitary modular weak-type inequality. These results follow from a pointwise estimate for the $\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal function of the commutator, together with a capacitary Fefferman-Stein inequality recently proved in [CC24].</description>

      <title>Frames generated by the functional calculus and function frames of a normal operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that sequences generated by the functional calculus $(f(T)(e_n))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ can be equivalently written as function sequences $(f_n(T) g)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, when $T$ is normal and $g$ a cyclic vector for $T$. Here, $(e_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of vectors, $T$ is a bounded normal operator, $f$ and $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are functions defined on a neighborhood of the spectrum $\sigma(T)$, and $g$ is a cyclic vector for $T$. After that, we characterize the frame property of such sequences in terms of the approximate point spectrum of $T^*$. Examples include certain operators (normal operators, compact operators, unilateral shifts, multiplication operators on Hardy spaces, etc.) that either generate only Riesz bases or allow redundancy. Our bridge theorem makes explicit the structural equivalence between frames generated by the functional calculus and function frames.</description>

      <title>On p-Brunn-Minkowski and Brascamp-Lieb inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a strong version of the Brascamp--Lieb inequality for symmetric log-concave measure with $\alpha$-homogeneous potential $V$ is equivalent to a $p$-Brunn--Minkowski inequality for level sets of $V$ with some $p(\alpha,n)&lt;0$. We establish links between several inequalities of this type on the sphere and the Euclidean space. Exploiting these observations, we prove new sufficient conditions for symmetric $p$-Brunn--Minkowski inequality with $p&lt;1$. In particular, we prove the local log-Brunn--Minkowski for $L_q$-balls for all $q\geq 1$ in all dimensions, which was previously known only for $q\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The series of papers is devoted to the study of convergence for pairs of surfaces and smooth functions thereon. We model such pairs with varifolds and multiple-valued functions to capture their limits. In the present paper, we study Young functions, a measure-theoretic approach to multiple-valued functions, and the graph measures associated with pairs of measures (in particular, varifolds) and Young functions. This setting allows us to model the convergence of pairs of surfaces and functions thereon via the weak convergence of their associated graph measures, and a compactness theorem follows immediately. As a prerequisite for the concepts of differentiability for Young functions in the upcoming papers, we introduce and investigate several test function spaces.</description>

      <title>Weak type (1,1) jump inequalities in a nonsymmetric Gaussian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the jump quasi-seminorm of order $\varrho= 2$ for a general Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$ in $\mathbb R^n$ defines an operator of weak type $(1,1)$ with respect to the invariant measure. This provides an example of a weak-type jump inequality for a nonsymmetric semigroup in a nondoubling measure space.
  Our result may be seen as an endpoint refinement of the weak type $(1,1)$ inequality for the $\varrho$-th order variation seminorm of $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$, recently proved by the authors when $\varrho&gt;2$, and disproved for $\varrho=2$.</description>

      <title>Littlewood-Paley inequalities for fractional derivative on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any pair $(n,p)$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$, it has been recently proved that a radial weight $\omega$ on the unit disc of the complex plane $\mathbb{D}$ satisfies the Littlewood-Paley equivalence $$ \int_{\mathbb{D}}|f(z)|^p\,\omega(z)\,dA(z)\asymp\int_\mathbb{D}|f^{(n)}(z)|^p(1-|z|)^{np}\omega(z)\,dA(z)+\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}|f^{(j)}(0)|^p,$$
  for any analytic function $f$ in $\mathbb{D}$, if and only if $\omega\in\mathcal{D}=\widehat{\mathcal{D}} \cap \check{\mathcal{D}}$. A radial weight $\omega$ belongs to the class $\widehat{\mathcal{D}}$ if
  $\sup_{0\le r&lt;1} \frac{\int_r^1 \omega(s)\,ds}{\int_{\frac{1+r}{2}}^1\omega(s)\,ds}&lt;\infty$, and $\omega \in \check{\mathcal{D}}$ if there exists $k&gt;1$ such that $\inf_{0\le r&lt;1} \frac{\int_{r}^1\omega(s)\,ds}{\int_{1-\frac{1-r}{k}}^1 \omega(s)\,ds}&gt;1$.
  In this paper we extend this result to the setting of fractional derivatives. Being precise, for an analytic function $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \widehat{f}(n) z^n$ we consider the fractional derivative
  $ D^{\mu}(f)(z)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\widehat{f}(n)}{\mu_{2n+1}} z^n
  $ induced by a radial weight $\mu \in \mathcal{D}$,
  where $\mu_{2n+1}=\int_0^1 r^{2n+1}\mu(r)\,dr$. Then, we prove that for any $p\in (0,\infty)$, the Littlewood-Paley equivalence $$\int_{\mathbb{D}} |f(z)|^p \omega(z)\,dA(z)\asymp \int_{\mathbb{D}}|D^{\mu}(f)(z)|^p\left[\int_{|z|}^1\mu(s)\,ds\right]^p\omega(z)\,dA(z)$$ holds for any analytic function $f$ in $\mathbb{D}$ if and only if $\omega\in\mathcal{D}$.
  We also prove that for any $p\in (0,\infty)$, the inequality
  $$\int_{\mathbb{D}} |D^{\mu}(f)(z)|^p \left[\int_{|z|}^1\mu(s)\,ds\right]^p\omega(z)\,dA(z)
  \lesssim \int_{\mathbb{D}} |f(z)|^p \omega(z)\,dA(z) $$ holds for any analytic function $f$ in $\mathbb{D}$ if and only if $\omega\in \widehat{\mathcal{D}}$.</description>

      <title>Bilateral facial reduction: qualification-free subdifferential calculus and exact duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qualification conditions (also termed constraint qualifications) help avoid pathological behavior at domain boundaries in convex analysis. By generalizing facial reduction from conic programming to general convex programs of the form $f(x) + g(Ax)$, we provide qualification-free generalizations of several key results: an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual, KKT optimality conditions, an attained infimal convolution for the conjugate of a sum, subdifferential sum and chain rules, and normal cones of intersections. All our results reduce seamlessly to their original formulations when qualification conditions hold.
  The core insight is that for a sum of two convex functions, there is an affine subspace$\unicode{x2014}$the joint supporting subspace$\unicode{x2014}$that contains the feasible region, and such that qualification conditions hold when restricting the effective domain of each function to it. We offer a number of characterizations for the joint supporting subspace, including one that obtains the affine subspace via iterative, bilateral reduction between the two domains. In our proofs, which are self-contained, we develop a structured induction on faces where inductive steps are associated with normal vectors nested in supporting subspaces (a generalization of supporting hyperplanes). With this tool, we characterize the facial structure of the difference of two convex sets from the facial structures of the individual convex sets.</description>

      <title>Examples of critically cyclic functions in the Dirichlet spaces of the ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct examples of holomorphic functions in $D_2(\B_2)$, the Dirichlet space on $\B_2$, for which there exists an index $\alpha_c \in [\frac12,2]$ such that the function is cyclic in $D_\alpha(\B_2)$ if and only if $\alpha \leq \alpha_c$. To this end, we use the notion of \emph{interpolation sets} in smooth ball algebras, as studied by Bruna, Ortega, Chaumat, and Chollet.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Accelerated Neural Network Interpolation Operators on Irregular Grids with Higher Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of \emph{Taylor-accelerated neural network interpolation operators} is introduced on quasi-uniform irregular grids. These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Jackson-type approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular grids, including Lagrange-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Multiple convolutions and multilinear fractal Fourier extension estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Stein--Tomas theorem extends the theory of linear Fourier restriction estimates from smooth manifolds to fractal measures exhibiting Fourier decay. In the multilinear setting, transversality allows for Fourier extension estimates that go beyond those implied by the linear theory to hold. We establish a multilinear Fourier extension estimate for measures whose convolution belongs to an $L^p$ space, applicable to known results by Shmerkin and Solomyak that exploit `transversality' between self-similar measures. Moreover, we generalise work by Hambrook--{\L}aba and Chen from the linear setting to obtain Knapp-type examples for multilinear estimates; we obtain two necessary conditions: one in terms of the upper box dimension of the measures' supports, and another one in terms of their Fourier decay and a ball condition. In particular, these conditions give a more restrictive range compared with previously known results whenever the convolution of the measures at play is singular.</description>
