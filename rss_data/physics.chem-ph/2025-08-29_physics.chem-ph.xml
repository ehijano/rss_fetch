      <title>Towards Balanced Description of Ground and Excited States with Transcorrelated F12 Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By correlating only the 1-particle states occupied in the reference determinant the conventional design for the single-reference R12/F12 explicitly-correlated methods biases them towards the ground state description thereby making treatment of response properties of the ground state, and energies and other properties of excited states less robust. While the use of multireference methods and/or extensions of the standard SP projected geminals can achieve a more balanced description of ground and excited states, here we show that the same goals can be achieved by extending the action of F12 correlators to the occupied and valence unoccupied 1-particle states only. This design choice reflects the strong dependence of the optimal correlation lengthscale of the F12 ansatz on the orbital energies/structure, and helps to avoid the unphysical raising of the ground state energy if the F12 geminals are used to correlate pairs of all 1-particle states. The improved F12 geminal design is incorporated into the unitary transcorrelation framework to produce a unitary 2-body Hamiltonian that incorporates the short-range dynamical correlation physics for ground and low-energy excited states in a balanced manner. This explicitly-correlated effective Hamiltonian reduces the basis set requirement on the correlation-consistent basis cardinal number by 1 or more over the uncorrelated counterpart for the description of the ground state coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energies, the vertical excitation energies and harmonic vibrational frequencies of equation-of-motion CCSD low-energy excited states.</description>

      <title>Molecular Machine Learning in Chemical Process Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</description>

      <title>Radial asymmetry in quadrupole mass filters: stability, multipole fields and resolution enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole mass filter with circular rods, introduced either by a change in electrode radii or by displacement of a diametrically opposite pair. A radial potential model is developed to account for the resulting geometric deviations, enabling analysis of the first stability region specific to the quadrupole component. The transmission characteristics of such asymmetric configurations are systematically examined, revealing a linear shift in the transmission peak along the q-axis as a function of the asymmetry parameter. This behavior is interpreted through modifications observed in the stability diagram. Furthermore, increased asymmetry is shown to broaden the transmission contours and generally reduce resolution. Notably, a `magic' asymmetry parameter of -0.02 corresponding to electrode displacement, yields enhanced resolution compared to the symmetric case for a fixed rod-to-field radius ratio. An empirical relationship is established between the resolution and the combined contribution of the coefficients of octupole and dodecapole potential components, highlighting the critical role of higher-order field effects in performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Representative Random Sampling of Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overwhelming majority of molecules remains unexplored. This is mostly due to the sheer number of them, which prohibits any enumeration of chemical space, the set of all such molecules. In practice, only subsets of chemical space are considered, but those subsets exhibit substantial bias, prohibiting data-driven characterization of chemical space itself. In this work, we provide a method produce unbiased representative random samples of chemical space without enumeration of constituent molecules and to estimate the number of molecules in any custom chemical space. The approach is applicable to molecules which can be represented as graph and runs efficiently even for molecules of 30 atoms. We use it to estimate the representativeness of current databases with respect to their underlying chemical space and to establish a necessary criterion for a lower bound of database sizes to be representative of an underlying chemical space.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular Interactions between Polyethylene, Water, and Potential Antistatic and Slip Additives: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additives are essential to enhance or modify the properties of plastics for target applications. However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging, since we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with moisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial additive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip properties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene, each of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture of their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by their polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor depending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene matrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial orientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when they are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to various degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene ones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the surface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of the additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these changes depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives are in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a drop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less depending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two proposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one could be applied as a slip agent. We hope that our predictions will spark interest in testing these molecules in the laboratory as polyethylene additives.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nanometer Interfacial Hydrodynamics: The Interplay of Interfacial Viscosity and Surface Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an accurate description of nanofluidic systems, it is crucial to account for the transport properties of liquids at surfaces on sub-nanometer scales, where classical hydrodynamics fails due to the finite range of surface-liquid interactions and modifications of the local viscosity. We show how to account for both via generalized, position-dependent surface-friction and interfacial viscosity profiles, which enables the accurate description of interfacial flow on the nanoscale using the Stokes equation. Such profiles are extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of water on polar, non-polar, fluorinated, and unfluorinated alkane and alcohol self-assembled monolayers of widely varying wetting characteristics. Power-law relationships among the Navier friction coefficient, interfacial viscosity excess, and depletion length are revealed, and these are each found to be exponential in the work of adhesion. Our framework forms the basis for describing sub-nanometer fluid flow at interfaces with implications for electrokinetics, biophysics, and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Strong Raman Optical Activity and Chiral Phonons in Chiral Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with chiral organic cations are very interesting for optoelectronic applications because of their intrinsically chiral light-matter interactions. Chiral distortions in these materials lead to circular dichroism, circular birefringence, and circularly polarized luminescence in the band transitions of the inorganic sublattice. Raman-active vibrational modes in these crystals are governed by crystal symmetry and therefore are also strongly impacted by the nature and magnitude of the chiral distortions. Here, we report low-frequency Raman modes that are sensitive to circularly polarized excitation in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (CHOIPs) across a wide range of structures and compositions. The circularly polarized Raman spectra from enantiomers of CHOIP single crystals exhibit sharp modes below 150 cm-1, corresponding to vibrations of the lead iodide octahedra. These modes exhibit strong differences in intensities (Raman optical activity, ROA) depending on the handedness of the excitation, with high degree of polarization for several modes. Calculations reveal the presence of several chiral phonon modes with opposite phonon angular momenta. The strong ROA and the chiral phonon modes are a direct consequence of chirality transfer from the chiral organic linker to the lead iodide octahedra in the CHOIP structure, resulting in a strong chiroptical response in the phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced premelting at the ice-rubber interface using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast solid-state chemical synthesis of BaTiO3 initiated by gyrotron microwave radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 - 7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.</description>

      <title>Revival of Layered Ferroelectrics in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskites are a versatile class of ferroelectrics with their structural anisotropy reflected in unusual electrostatics that give rise to exceptional ferroelectric properties. These materials fall into four main families: Aurivillius, Carpy-Galy, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson phases; each forming natural superlattices by interleaving perovskite slabs with spacer layers. For a long time, these materials were considered too structurally complex to prepare as high-quality thin films. However, recent breakthroughs in deposition and advanced characterization have made it possible to stabilize high-quality films with atomic precision, uncovering a wide range of unconventional ferroelectric functionalities. These include robust in-plane polarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain walls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions and charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into standard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current knowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin films, and to present research findings across all four structural families, with the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in crystal structure and polarization mechanisms. We also discuss promising research directions, including polar metallicity, (alter-)magnetoelectricity, exfoliation, and soft-chemistry-driven phase transformations, with the goal of consolidating the field and encouraging further exploration of these materials for both fundamental studies and applications.</description>

      <title>Lithiation Analysis of Metal Components for Li-Ion Battery using Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal components are extensively used as current collectors, anodes, and interlayers in lithium-ion batteries. Integrating these functions into one component enhances the cell energy density and simplifies its design. However, this multifunctional component must meet stringent requirements, including high and reversible Li storage capacity, rapid lithiation/delithiation kinetics, mechanical stability, and safety. Six single-atom metals (Mg, Zn, Al, Ag, Sn and Cu) are screened for lithiation behavior through their interaction with ion beams in electrochemically tested samples subjected to both weak and strong lithiation regimes. These different lithiation regimes allowed us to differentiate between the thermodynamics and kinetic aspects of the lithiation process. Three types of ions are used to determine Li depth profile: $H^+$ for nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), $He^+$ for Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and $Ga^+$ for focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The study reveals three lithiation behaviors: (i) Zn, Al, Sn form pure alloys with Li; (ii) Mg, Ag create intercalation solid solutions; (iii) Cu acts as a lithiation barrier. NRA and RBS offer direct and quantitative data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the lithiation process in LIB components. These findings fit well with our ab-initio simulation results, establishing a direct correlation between electrochemical features and fundamental thermodynamic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel approach to subsystem decoherence without the usual tracing-out of the environment. The subsystem of focus is described entirely by a pure state evolving non-unitarily along a single classical trajectory of its environment. The approach is deduced from the exact factorization framework for arbitrary systems of electrons and nuclei. The non-unitarity of the electronic dynamics arises exclusively fromnon-adiabatic correlations between electrons and nuclei. We demonstrate that the approach correctly describes the coherence gain and the subsequent decoherence for the example of a nuclear trajectory passing through an avoided crossing, the prototypical case where single-trajectory Ehrenfest dynamics fails to produce decoherence.</description>

      <title>Vib2Mol: from vibrational spectra to molecular structures-a versatile deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There will be a paradigm shift in chemical and biological research, to be enabled by autonomous, closed-loop, real-time self-directed decision-making experimentation. Spectrum-to-structure correlation, which is to elucidate molecular structures with spectral information, is the core step in understanding the experimental results and to close the loop. However, current approaches usually divide the task into either database-dependent retrieval and database-independent generation and neglect the inherent complementarity between them. In this study, we proposed Vib2Mol, a versatile deep learning model designed to flexibly handle diverse spectrum-to-structure tasks according to the available prior knowledge by bridging the retrieval and generation. It not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in analyzing theoretical Infrared and Raman spectra, but also outperform previous models at experimental data. Moreover, Vib2Mol demonstrates promising capabilities in predicting reaction products and sequencing peptides, enabling vibrational spectroscopy a real-time guide for autonomous scientific discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Pruned-ADAPT-VQE: compacting molecular ans\"atze by removing irrelevant operators</title>

Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is one of the most widely used algorithms for electronic structure calculations in quantum computers. It adaptively selects operators based on their gradient, constructing ans\"atze that continuously evolve to match the energy landscape, helping avoid local traps and barren plateaus. However, this flexibility in reoptimization can lead to the inclusion of redundant or inefficient operators that have almost zero parameter value, barely contributing to the ansatz. We identify three phenomena responsible for the appearance of these operators: poor operator selection, operator reordering, and fading operators. In this work, we propose an automated, cost-free refinement method that removes unnecessary operators from the ansatz without disrupting convergence. Our approach evaluates each operator after ADAPT-VQE optimization by using a function that considers both its parameter value and position in the ansatz, striking a balance between eliminating low-coefficient operators while preserving the natural reduction of coefficients as the ansatz grows. Additionally, a dynamic threshold based on the parameters of recent operators enables efficient convergence. We apply this method to several molecular systems and find that it reduces ansatz size and accelerates convergence, particularly in cases with flat energy landscapes. The refinement process incurs, at most, a small additional computational cost and consistently improves or maintains ADAPT-VQE performance.</description>

      <title>A Cavity-Enhanced Spectroscopist's Lens on Molecular Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton chemistry has been hailed as a potential new route to direct molecular processes with electromagnetic fields. To make further strides, it is essential for the community to clarify which unusual polaritonic phenomena are true hallmarks of cavity quantum electrodynamics and which can be rationalized with classical optical physics. Here, we provide a tutorial perspective on the formation, spectroscopy, and behavior of molecular polaritons using classical optics. Where possible, we draw connections to cavity-enhanced spectroscopy and recast open questions in terms that may be more familiar to the broader community of physical chemists.</description>

      <title>Implementation of McMurchie-Davidson algorithm for Gaussian AO integrals suited for SIMD processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson evaluation scheme for 1- and 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals designed for processors with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction sets. Like in our recent MD implementation for graphical processing units (GPUs) [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 244109 (2024)], variable-sized batches of shellsets of integrals are evaluated at a time. By optimizing for the floating point instruction throughput rather than minimizing the number of operations, this approach achieves up to 50% of the theoretical hardware peak FP64 performance for many common SIMD-equipped platforms (AVX2, AVX512, NEON), which translates to speedups of up to 30 over the state-of-the-art one-shellset-at-a-time implementation of Obara-Saika-type schemes in Libint for a variety of primitive and contracted integrals. As with our previous work, we rely on the standard C++ programming language -- such as the std::simd standard library feature to be included in the 2026 ISO C++ standard -- without any explicit code generation to keep the code base small and portable. The implementation is part of the open source LibintX library freely available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/libintx.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>
