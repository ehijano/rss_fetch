      <title>Automated Microsolvation for Minimum Energy Path Construction in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing chemical reactions in solution on a molecular level is a challenging task due to the high mobility of weakly interacting solvent molecules which requires configurational sampling. For instance, polar and protic solvents can interact strongly with solutes and may interfere in reactions. However, to define and identify representative arrangements of solvent molecules modulating a transition state is a non-trivial task. Here, we propose to monitor their active participation in the decaying normal mode at a transition state, which defines active solvent molecules. Moreover, it is desirable to prepare a low-dimensional microsolvation model in a well-defined, fully automated, high-throughput, and easy-to-deploy fashion, which we propose to derive in a stepwise protocol. First, transition state structures are optimized in a sufficiently solvated quantum-classical hybrid model, which are then subjected to a re-definition of a then reduced quantum region. From the reduced model, minimally microsolvated structures are extracted that contain only active solvent molecules. Modeling the remaining solvation effects is deferred to a continuum model. To establish an easy-to-use free-energy model, we combine the standard thermochemical gas-phase model with a correction for the cavity entropy in solution. We assess our microsolvation and free-energy models for methanediol formation from formaldehyde, for the hydration of carbon dioxide (which we consider in a solvent mixture to demonstrate the versatility of our approach), and, finally, for the chlorination of phenol with hypochlorous acid.</description>

      <title>Twin-Space Representation of Classical Mapping Model in the Constraint Phase Space Representation: Numerically Exact Approach to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) has recently been developed to study nonadiabatic dynamics in gas-phase and condensed-phase molecular systems. Although the CPS formulation is exact for describing the discrete (electronic/ vibrational/spin) state degrees of freedom (DOFs), when system-bath models in condense phase are studied, previous works often employ the discretization of environmental bath DOFs, which breaks the time irreversibility and may make it difficult to obtain numerically converged results in the long-time limit. In this paper, we develop an exact trajectory-based phase space approach by adopting the twin-space (TS) formulation of quantum statistical mechanics, in which the density operator of the reduced system is transformed to the wavefunction of an expanded system with twice the DOFs. The classical mapping model (CMM) is then used to map the Hamiltonian of the expanded system to its equivalent classical counterpart on CPS. To demonstrate the applicability of the TS-CMM approach, we compare simulated population dynamics and nonlinear spectra for a few benchmark condensed phase system-bath models with those obtained from the hierarchical equations of motion method, which shows that our approach yields accurate dynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic decoherence along a single nuclear trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel approach to subsystem decoherence without the usual tracing-out of the environment. The subsystem of focus is described entirely by a pure state evolving non-unitarily along a single classical trajectory of its environment. The approach is deduced from the exact factorization framework for arbitrary systems of electrons and nuclei. The non-unitarity of the electronic dynamics arises exclusively from non-adiabatic correlations between electrons and nuclei. We demonstrate that the approach correctly describes the coherence gain and the subsequent decoherence for the example of a nuclear trajectory passing through an avoided crossing, the prototypical case where single-trajectory Ehrenfest dynamics fails to produce decoherence. We further demonstrate that the essential difference between unitary and non-unitary electronic dynamics shows up in the time constants characterising the short-time regime.</description>

      <title>CO2 Hydration at the Air-Water Interface: A Surface-Mediated 'In and Out' Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An understanding of the CO2 + H2O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air-water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO2 makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art machine-learned potentials to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO2 hydration at the air-water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated `In and Out' mechanism: CO2 diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils a new, unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air-water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO2 hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Magic Numbers in Spherical Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers in finite particle systems correspond to specific system sizes that allow configurations with low free energy, often exhibiting closed surface shells to maximize the number of nearest neighbors. Since their discovery in atomic nuclei, magic numbers have been essential for understanding the number-structure-property relationship in finite clusters across different scales. However, as system size increases, the significance of magic numbers diminishes, and the precise system size at which magic number phenomena disappear remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters formed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display icosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced free energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size, closed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced. Instead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football cluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated facets disconnected by terraces. A sphere packing model demonstrates that forming closed surface shells becomes impossible beyond a critical system size, explaining the breakdown of magic numbers in large confined systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ for molecules with vertex corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the $\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ self-energy in the quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ (qs$GW$) framework (qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$). Here, $L$ is the two-particle response function which we calculate by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the static, first-order $GW$ kernel. The same kernel is added to $\Sigma$ directly. For a set of medium organic molecules, we show that including the vertex both in $L$ and $\Sigma$ is crucial. This approach retains the good performance of qs$GW$ for predicting first ionization potentials and fundamental gaps, while it greatly improves the description of electron affinities. Its good performance places qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ among the best-performing electron propagator methods for charged excitations. Adding the vertex in $L$ only, as commonly done in the solid state community, leads to devastating results for electron affinities and fundamental gaps. We also test the performance of BSE@qs$GW$ and qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ for neutral charge-transfer excitation and find both methods to perform similar. We conclude that $\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ is a promising approximation to the electronic self-energy beyond $GW$. We hope that future research on dynamical vertex effects, second-order vertex corrections, and full self-consistency will improve the accuracy of this method, both for charged and neutral excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Fast and flexible long-range models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz, and decompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions. This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that are dominated by long-range physical effects - most notably electrostatics. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to make them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to incorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range interactions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the established algorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions - including Ewald summation, classical particle-mesh Ewald (PME), and particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) Ewald - into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for pyTorch as well as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range potentials, we introduce purified descriptors which disregard the immediate neighborhood of each atom, and are more suitable for general long-ranged ML applications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They provide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used in the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the availability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range models with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible to implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as building blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pme libraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, to train ML potentials, and to evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</description>
