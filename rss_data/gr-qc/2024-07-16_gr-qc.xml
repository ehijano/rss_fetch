      <title>Constraining Parameters for the Accelerating Universe in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we present an accelerating cosmological model in $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity with the parameter constrained through the cosmological data sets. At the beginning, we have employed a functional form of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m}) =\frac{R}{2}+\alpha R^2+\mathcal{L}_{m}^\beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters. This model is well motivated from the Starobinsky model in $f(R)$ gravity and the power law form of $f(\mathcal{L}_{m})$. The Hubble parameter has been derived with some algebraic manipulation and constrained by Hubble data and Pantheon$^{+}$ data. With the constraint parameters, present value of deceleration parameter has been obtained to as $q_{0}\approx-0.63$ with the transition at $z_{t}\approx0.7$. It shows the early deceleration and late time acceleration behaviour. The present value of other geometric parameters such as the jerk and snap parameter are obtained to be $j_{0}\approx0.78$ and $s_{0}\approx 0.1$ respectively. The state finder diagnostic test gives the quintessence behaviour at present and converging to $\Lambda$CDM at late times. Moreover the $Om(z)$ diagnostics gives negative slope which shows that the model favours the state finder diagnostic result. Also the current age of Universe has been obtained as, $t_{0} = 13.64~~Gyrs$. The equation of state parameter also shows the quintessence behaviour. Based on the present analysis, it indicates that the $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravitational theory may be another alternative to study the dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of Schwinger Mechanism in Electromagnetically Accelerating Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum electrodynamics, Schwinger showed in 1951 that in a uniform electric field the vacuum may spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs. For this to occur, the required electric field is exceptionally large, $\sim 10^{18}$ N/C. In the Electromagnetically Accelerating Universe (EAU) model, such an electric field would be undesirable because it discharges the Primoridal Extemely Massive Naked Singularities (PEMNSs) whose mutual repulsion causes the acceleration. This leads to a constraints on the charges and masses of the PEMNSs which must be satisfied in an EAU model.</description>

      <title>Gravastar model in the structure of $f(R,L_{m}, T)$ modified theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gravastar ( or the Gravitational Vacuum Star ) is a very serious alternatives proposed to the principle of the Black Hole, the model of which was originally developed by Mazur and Mottola. A Gravastar is an astronomically hypothetically condensed object which is a gravitationally dark vacuum star or a gravitational vacuum condensate star, which is singularity free, spherically symmetric and also super compact. The current study concerns about the model of the Gravastar in the modified $f(R,L_{m}, T)$ gravity considering the form $f(R,L_{m},T) = R + {\alpha}TL_{m} $. From Mazur-Mottola \cite{Mazur}-\cite{Mottola}, we get to know that a Gravastar model has three distinct regions having various Equations of State (EoS). We have inquired into the interior portion with the space-time considering $ \rho = - p $, for the dark sector of the interior region, here the negative matter-energy density exerting a repulsive force on the immediate thin shell with the EoS $ \rho = p $ where it is considered as an ultra-relativistic fluid. We have studied the properties such as energy density, proper length, total energy and entropy. Next comes the vacuum exterior region of the Gravastar which is being described by the Schwarzschild-de-Sitter solution. And also from Darmois-Israel formalism, we have probed the junction connecting the inner and the outer surfaces of the Gravastar.</description>

      <title>Why scalar field is indispensable in Teleparallel Gravity theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity theories were proposed as alternatives to the dark energy and modified theories of gravity. However, both the metric and symmetric teleparallel gravity theories have been found to have serious pathologies, such as coupling issues and Ostrogradski's instability leading to ghost degrees of freedom. In this article we explore the fact that the theories are at-least free from the issue of `Branched Hamiltonian' though, nonetheless, early inflation as well as a viable radiation era may only be driven by a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Can $f(T)$ models play a bridge between early and late time Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory to accurately predict the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium, as well as the baryon content of the Universe, is considered one of the most significant achievements in modern physics. In the present study, we consider two highly motivated hybrid $f(T)$ models and constrain them using the observations from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis era. In addition, using late-time observations of Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray-Bursts, the ranges of the model parameters are confined which are in good agreement with early time bounds. Subsequently, the common ranges obtained from the analysis for early and late time are summarized. Further, we verify the intermediating epochs by investigating the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the common range. From this study, we find the considered teleparallel models are viable candidates to explain the primordial-intermediating-present epochs.</description>

      <title>Ellis wormhole with nonlinear electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the spherically symmetric wormhole in Einstein's gravity coupling phantom field and nonlinear electromagnetic field. Numerical results show that this solution violates the Null Energy Condition (NEC), and as the parameters change, the ADM mass of the entire spacetime changes from positive to negative. In addition, we analyze the light ring (LR) of the solution and demonstrate the astronomical observation properties. Especially when negative mass appears, the general LR will not appear, only a ``special unstable LR" exists at the throat, which is caused by the repulsive effect of the negative mass on both sides of the wormhole. Finally, we draw the embedding diagram to reflect the geometric characteristics of the wormhole.</description>

      <title>Real-time gravitational-wave inference for binary neutron stars using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 led to scientific discoveries across cosmology, nuclear physics, and gravity. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated EM transient, AT 2017gfo, 11 hours after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive EM observations; however, due to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here, we develop a machine learning approach that performs complete BNS inference in just one second without making any such approximations. This is enabled by a new method for explicit integration of physical domain knowledge into neural networks. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing (i) accurate localization even before the merger; (ii) improved localization precision by $\sim30\%$ compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (iii) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state and waveform systematics studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to extremely long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Generating Kerr-anti-de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we study the construction of different thermodynamic descriptions for the Kerr-anti-de Sitter (KadS) black holes. The early versions of the KadS thermodynamics are briefly discussed, highlighting some of its strong points and shortcomings. Isohomogeneous transformations, a procedure for generating new thermodynamics, are presented and geometrically interpreted for KadS. This tool is used to determine possible KadS thermodynamics that can be constructed to satisfy a Smarr formula, and the validity of the first law in the generated thermodynamics. The connection between new thermodynamic theories and early Hawking's approach is considered. In this new framework, the usual KadS thermodynamics is complemented with its geometric construction, and Hawking's proposal, which does not satisfy the first law, is improved to an alternative thermodynamic theory. With the quantum statistical relation, Hawking's and this alternative KadS thermodynamics are also generalized from four to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phase-space Path Integral Approach to the Kinetics of Black Hole Phase Transition in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the state-switching process of black holes in dRGT massive gravity theory is presented using free energy landscape and stochastic Langevin equations. The free energy landscape is constructed using the Gibbons-Hawking path integral method. The black hole phases are characterized by taking its horizon radius as the order parameter. The free energy landscape provides three black hole phases: small, intermediate, and large. The small and large black holes are thermodynamically stable whereas the intermediate one is unstable. The Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional describes the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition. The Hamiltonian flow lines are obtained from the MSRJD functional and are used to analyze the stability and the phase transition properties. The dominant kinetic path between different phases is discussed for various configurations of the free energy landscape. We discuss the effect of black hole charge and the graviton mass on the critical behavior of black hole phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present solutions corresponding to rotational configurations in the recently proposed Geometric Scalar Gravity (GSG) theory. The solutions obtained here have the important property that the associated closed time-like curves are always restricted to a compact domain of space-time. We compare this property with those of analogous solutions in General Relativity (GR).</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Fluctuation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09912v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction. The result presented in this work may be applied in understanding the origin of irreversibility in macroscopic processes in the presence of relativistic gravity, as in most astrophysical or cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous cosmological model in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the impact of bulk viscosity on understanding the universe's accelerated expansion within the context of modified $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, which is an extension of the $f(T)$ gravitational theory, allowing a broad coupling between the energy-momentum scalar $\mathcal{T}$ and the torsion scalar $T$. We consider two $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ functions, specifically $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary constants, along with the fluid part incorporating the coefficient of bulk viscosity $\zeta=\zeta_0 &gt; 0$. We calculate the analytical solutions of the corresponding field equations for a flat FLRW environment, and then we constrain the free parameters of the obtained solution using CC, Pantheon+, and the CC+Pantheon+ samples. We perform the Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability utilizing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique. Further, to assess the effectiveness of our MCMC analysis, we estimate the corresponding AIC and BIC values, and we find that there is strong evidence supporting the assumed viscous modified gravity models for all three data sets. Also, we find that the linear model precisely mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate the evolutionary behavior of some prominent cosmological parameters. We observe that the effective equation of state parameter for both models predict the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. In addition, from the statefinder test, we find that the parameters of the considered MOG models favor the quintessence-type behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study closed string evolution in the pp-wave spacetime assuming different pulse shapes (square and sech-squared) in the exact gravitational wave metric. It is shown that the shape of a circular closed string changes permanently to an elliptical form after the pulse has departed. The worldsheet geometry also displays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave pulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is known as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Covariance in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the longstanding issue of general covariance in spherically symmetric gravity, arising when canonical quantum gravity leads to a semiclassical model described by an effective Hamiltonian constraint. Applying the minimal requirements proposed to ensure general covariance, we derive the equations for the effective Hamiltonian constraint with the aid of imposing demands on Dirac observables. The equations yield two candidates for effective Hamiltonian constraints dependent on a quantum parameter. The resulting quantum modified black hole spacetimes are analyzed. Particularly, our models show improvement by casting off the known limitations of previous works with similar results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the angle of deflection of light by the gravitational field inside and outside a spherical body with a homogeneous mass density. We show that the largest deflections, which can be measured by weak gravitational lensing, are in a region displaced from the center of mass. This result can be extended to more general distributions of matter. This displacement, observed in galaxies and colliding galaxy clusters, may be therefore explained without dark matter, within general relativity.</description>

      <title>Warm inflation in a Universe with a Weylian boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundary terms in the warm inflationary scenario, by considering that in the Einstein-Hilbert action the boundary can be described in terms of a Weyl-type geometry. The gravitational action, as well as the field equations, are thus extended to include new geometrical terms, coming from the non-metric nature of the boundary, and depending on the Weyl vector, and its covariant derivatives. We investigate the effects of these new boundary terms by considering the warm inflationary scenario of the early evolution of the Universe, in the presence of a scalar field. We obtain the generalized Friedmann equations in the Universe with a Weylian boundary by considering the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. We consider the simultaneous decay of the scalar field, and of the creation of radiation, by appropriately splitting the general conservation equation through the introduction of the dissipation coefficient, which can depend on both the scalar field, and the Weyl vector. We consider three distinct warm inflationary models, in which the dissipation coefficients are chosen as different functions of the scalar field and of the Weyl vector. The numerical solutions of the cosmological evolution equations show that the radiation is created during the very early phases of expansion, and, after the radiation reaches its maximum value, the transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one takes place. Moreover, it turns out that the the Weyl vector, describing the boundary effects on the cosmological evolution, plays a significant role during the process of radiation creation.</description>

      <title>Pre-Merger Detection and Characterization of Inspiraling Binary Neutron Stars Derived from Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the sensitivity of the international gravitational wave detector network increases, observing binary neutron star signals will become more common. Moreover, since these signals will be louder, the chances of detecting them before their mergers increase. However, this requires an efficient framework. In this work, we present a machine-learning-based framework capable of detecting and analyzing binary neutron star mergers during their inspiral. Using a residual network to summarize the strain data, we use its output as input to a classifier giving the probability of having a signal in the data, and to a normalizing-flow network to perform neural posterior estimation. We train a network for several maximum frequencies reached by the signal to improve the estimate over time. Our framework shows good results both for detection and characterization, with improved parameter estimation as we get closer to the merger time. Thus, we can effectively evolve the precision of the sky location as the merger draws closer. Such a setup would be important for future multi-messenger searches where one would like to have the most precise information possible, as early as possible.</description>

      <title>Constraining Weyl type f(Q,T) gravity with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ modified gravity theory is an extension of the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ type theories, where $T$ is the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, and the scalar non-metricity $Q$ is represented in its standard Weyl form, and it is fully determined by a vector field $\omega _\mu$. The theory can give a good description of the observational data, and of the evolution of the late-time Universe, including a geometric explanation of the dark energy. In this work we investigate the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on several Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ gravity models. In particular, we consider the corrections that Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ terms induce on the freeze-out temperature $\mathcal{T}_f$, as compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM results. We analyze in detail three distinct cosmological models, corresponding to specific choices of the functional form of $f(Q,T)$. The first model has a simple linear additive structure in $Q$ and $T$, the second model is multiplicative in $Q$ and $T$, while the third is additive in $T$ and the exponential of $Q$. For each $f(Q,T)$ we consider first the cosmological evolution in the radiation dominated era, and then we impose the observational bound on $\left|\delta \mathcal{T}_f/ \mathcal{T}_f\right|$ to obtain constraints on the model parameters from the primordial abundances of the light elements such as helium-4, deuterium and lithium-7. The abundances of helium-4 and deuterium agree with theoretical predictions, however, the lithium problem, even slightly alleviated, still persists for the considered Weyl type $f(Q,T)$ models. Generally, these models satisfy the BBN constraints, and thus they represent viable cosmologies describing the entire dynamical time scale of the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Role of Complexity on the Minimal Deformation of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spherically symmetric classes of anisotropic solutions within the realm of a schematic gravitational decoupling scheme, primarily decoupling through minimal geometric deformation, applied to non-rotating, ultra-compact, self-gravitational fluid distributions. In this respect, we employ the minimal complexity factor scheme to generate physically realistic models for anisotropic matter distributions, using a well-behaved model. The zero-complexity factor condition enables us to determine the deformation function for solving the decoupled system. We explore all the structure-defining scalar variables, such as density inhomogeneity, strong energy condition, density homogeneity, and the complexity factor (an alloy of density inhomogeneity and pressure anisotropy) for the decoupling constant ranging between $0$ and $1$. We observe that the anisotropy vanishes when the coupling constant is set to unity. This finding holds significance as it implies that, in the context of a zero-complexity factor approach, an anisotropic matter distribution becomes perfect without requiring any isotropy requirements. This work effectively explored the impact of complexity on the composition of self-gravitational stellar distributions. This effective approach enables the development of new, physically realistic isotropic stellar models for anisotropic matter distributions. Additionally, our findings indicate that the complexity factor in static, spherically symmetric self-gravitational objects can significantly affect the nature of the matter distribution within these systems. It is concluded that the minimally deformed Durgapal-IV model features an increasing pressure profile, and the local anisotropy of pressure vanishes throughout the model under complexity-free conditions.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of de Sitter from the anti de Sitter spacetime in scalar field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of Einstein-scalar gravity, the de Sitter (dS) spacetime can be nucleated out of the anti de Sitter (AdS) one. This is done by using a scalar lump solution, which has an $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime in the core, allows for $\text{dS}_4$ vacua and was found to be plagued by tachyonic instabilities. Using the Euclidean action formalism, we compute and compare the probability amplitudes and the free energies of the lump and the $\text{dS}_4$ vacua. Our results show that the former is generally less favored than the latter, with the most preferred state being a $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. The lump, thus, describes a metastable state which eventually decays into the true $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. This nucleation mechanism of dS spacetime may provide insights into the short-distance behavior of gravity, in particular for the characterization of string-theory vacua, cosmological inflation and the black-hole singularity problem.</description>

      <title>Charged analogues of a singularity-free anisotropic compact star under linear $f(Q)$- action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10587v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study simulates the characteristics of spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar bodies with electrical charge within the context of the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. Employing the Krori-Barua metric ansatz (K.D. Krori, J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508) along with a linear form of $f(Q)$ model, {\it viz.}, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we obtain a tractable set of exact relativistic solutions of the field equations. A specific form of charge $(q=q_{0}r^{3})$ is considered here for the present analysis. Using the data sets of $\rho$ and $p_{r}$ along with the method of curve fitting, we have obtained the best fit equation of state in the model, which is incorporated in the numerical solutions of the TOV equations to determine the maximum mass and radius in this scenario. With increasing charge intensity $(q_{0})$ from 0.0002 to 0.0006, the maximum mass ranges from $2.838-2.869~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radii range from $12.0039-12.0822~Km$. Moreover, the predicted radii of some recently observed pulsars and GW 190814 show that our model also complies with the estimated radii based on the observational results. Our model is found to satisfy all the characteristic features, such as behaviour of matter variables, causality condition, energy constraints and stability criteria, which are pertinent in the context of a stable stellar configuration to emerge as a viable and physically acceptable stellar model in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trapped tubes in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

Abstract: We establish boundedness and polynomial decay results for the Teukolsky system in the exterior spacetime of very slowly rotating and strongly charged sub-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, with a focus on axially symmetric solutions. The key step in achieving these results is deriving a physical-space Morawetz estimate for the associated generalized Regge-Wheeler system, without relying on spherical harmonic decomposition.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper on the displacement memory effect [1], suggested that particles hit by a burst of gravitational waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed numerically for the wave profile which is the derivative of a Gaussian proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2]. The study is extended to higher-order derivative profiles as proposed e.g. for gravitational collapse, etc.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of a (neutral) test particle in Topological Star spacetime undergoing scattering processes by a superposed test radiation field, a situation that in a 4D black hole spacetime is known as relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect, paving the way for future studies involving radiation-reaction effects. Furthermore, we study self-force-driven evolution of a scalar field, perturbing the Top-Star spacetime with a scalar charge current. The latter for simplicity is taken to be circular, equatorial and geodetic. To perform this study, besides solving all the self-force related problem (regularization of all divergences due to the self-field, mode sum regularization, etc.), we had to adapt the 4D Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism to the present 5D situation. Finally, we have compared this formalism with the (quantum) Seiberg-Witten formalism, both related to the solutions of a Heun Confluent Equation, but appearing in different contexts in the literature, black hole perturbation theory the first, quantum curves in super-Yang-Mills theories the second.</description>

      <title>A physical reinterpretation of heat capacity discontinuities for static black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic characteristic of self-graviting systems is that they have a negative heat capacity. An important example of this behaviour is given by the Schwarzschild black hole. The case of charged and rotating black holes is even more interesting, since a change of sign of the specific heat takes place through an infinite discontinuity. This has been usually associated with a black hole thermodynamic phase transition appearing at the points where the heat capacity diverges, the so-called Davies points. This aspect of black hole thermodynamics has been addressed from different perspectives, motivating different interpretations since its discovery in the 1970s. In this paper, a physical reinterpretation of the heat capacity is provided for spherically symmetric and static black holes. Our analysis is partially based on a reformulation of the black hole heat capacity using the Newman--Penrose formalism. The application to the Reissner--Nordstr\"om--de Sitter black hole case reveals a clear physical interpretation of the Newman--Penrose scalars evaluated at the event horizon. This allows us to write the heat capacity as a balance of pressures defined at the horizon. In particular, a matter pressure (coming from the energy-momentum tensor) and a thermal pressure (coming from the holographic energy equipartition of the horizon). The Davies point is identified with the point where the Komar thermal energy density matches the matter pressure at the horizon. We also compare the black hole case with the case of self-graviting objects and their corresponding thermal evolutions. We conclude that the heat capacity of black holes and self-graviting systems can be understood qualitatively in similar terms.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Flux in Scalar-Tensor Theories up to 1.5 post-Newtonian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the angular momentum flux from a non-circular nonspinning binary system of compact objects in massless scalar-tensor theories up to one and a half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) order using multipole moments. The angular momentum flux in scalar-tensor theories involves both a tensorial and a scalar contribution which can be further decomposed as instantaneous, tail and non-linear memory effects up to 1.5PN order. We compute the explicit expressions of tail effects using the Fourier decomposition of tensorial and scalar multipole moments, and non-linear memory effects using the Newtonian order quasi-Keplerian representation of elliptic orbits in scalar-tensor theories. This work is important to construct the radiation-reaction force and hence the waveform templates for eccentric binaries in scalar-tensor theories of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a correspondence, for Riemannian manifolds with self-dual Weyl tensor, between twistor functions and solutions to the Teukolsky equations for any conformal and spin weights. In particular, we give a contour integral formula for solutions to the Teukolsky equations, and we find a recursion operator that generates an infinite family of solutions and leads to the construction of Cech representatives and sheaf cohomology classes on twistor space. Apart from the general conformally self-dual case, examples include self-dual black holes, scalar-flat K\"ahler surfaces, and quaternionic-K\"ahler metrics, where we map the Teukolsky equation to the conformal wave equation, establish new relations to the linearised Przanowski equation, and find new classes of quaternionic deformations.</description>

      <title>Corrected Thermodynamics and Stability of Magnetic charged AdS Black Holes surrounded by Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the corrected thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes surrounded by quintessence, incorporating thermal fluctuations and deriving the corrected thermodynamic potentials. We analyze the effects of corrections due to thermal fluctuations on various thermodynamic potentials, including enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy. Our results show significant impacts on smaller black holes, with first-order corrections destabilizing them, while second-order corrections enhance stability with increasing parameter values. The specific heat analysis further elucidates the stability criteria, indicating that the large black holes ensure stability against phase transitions. However, the thermal fluctuations do not affect the physical limitation points as well as the second-order phase transition points of the black hole. Our findings highlight the intricate role of thermal fluctuations in black hole thermodynamics and their influence on stability, providing deeper insights into the behaviour of black holes under corrected thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is the ``smoking gun'' that GWs are present, so PTAs ``reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which this curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because (a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW sources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a Gaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance using an optimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky locations and the power spectrum of the GWs. The variance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and the denominator is the number of frequency bins for which the GW signal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each frequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field theoretic wavefunction in cosmological spacetimes has received much attention as a fundamental object underlying the generation of primordial perturbations in our universe. Assuming an initial Bunch-Davies state, unitary time evolution implies an infinite set of cutting rules for the wavefunction to all orders in perturbation theory, collectively known as the cosmological optical theorem. In this work, we generalise these results to the case of Bogoliubov initial states, accounting for both parity-even and parity-odd interactions. We confirm our findings in a few explicit examples, assuming IR-finite interactions. In these examples, we preserve scale invariance by adiabatically turning on interactions in the infinite past rather than imposing a Bogoliubov state at some finite initial time. Finally, we give a prescription for computing Bogoliubov wavefunction coefficients from the corresponding Bunch-Davies coefficients for both n-point contact and four-point exchange diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are oscillations of space-time that are created, for example, in black hole mergers. If these waves travel through another massive astrophysical object, they will undergo an effect called gravitational lensing, that will distort and deflect them. This effect can create multiple images of the gravitational wave signal, and interference between them. In this document, we describe the sonification process of the gravitational lensing effect on gravitational waves. Sonification is the translation of data into sound. The wave nature of sound creates interference between waves in a natural way.

      <title>A non-local way around the no-global-symmetries conjecture in quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The no-global-symmetries conjecture is central to the swampland program that delineates the boundary between effective field theories that can be obtained from a quantum theory of gravity to those that cannot. The conjecture states that virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms which violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because of its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of this conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime geometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be suppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting and make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the horizon. By constructing a non-local action from the inverse of such curvature invariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole configurations in the path integral.</description>

      <title>The particle content of $R^2$ gravity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the spectrum of (pure) $R^2$ gravity on Minkowski background inevitably results into a Catch-22: any consistent interpretation of its particle dynamics dictates that no accidental gauge symmetries emerge, a requirement that cannot be fulfilled when the theory is studied on Minkowski.
  For the case at hand, there is an emergent gauge redundancy corresponding to a transverse-traceless shift of the graviton. This has detrimental consequences since it empties the spectrum from all particle states. Being an artifact of the linearized approximation on top of Minkowski background, the symmetry does not persist at higher orders and degrees of freedom are reintroduced via interactions, making $R^2$ gravity infinitely strongly-coupled.
  Provided that the theory is considered on appropriate backgrounds -- for instance de Sitter spacetime -- or is supplemented with the Einstein-Hilbert term, $R^2$ gravity propagates the two usual graviton polarizations plus one additional (massless or massive) scalar field. We explicitly demonstrate that in a fully covariant manner.</description>

      <title>A Transformation Theorem for Transverse Signature-Type Changing Semi-Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early eighties Hartle and Hawking put forth that signature-type change may be conceptually interesting, paving the way to the so-called 'no boundary' proposal for the initial conditions for the universe. Such singularity-free universes have no beginning, but they do have an origin of time. In mathematical terms, we are dealing with signature-type changing manifolds where a Riemannian region (i.e., a region with a positive definite metric) is smoothly joined to a Lorentzian region at the surface of transition where time begins.
  We present a transformation prescription to transform an arbitrary Lorentzian manifold into a singular signature-type changing manifold. Then we establish the Transformation Theorem, asserting that, conversely, under certain conditions, such a metric $(M,\tilde{g})$ can be obtained from some Lorentz metric $g$ through the aforementioned transformation procedure. By augmenting the assumption by certain constraints, mutatis mutandis, the global version of the Transformation Theorem can be proven as well. In conclusion, we make use of the Transformation Prescription to demonstrate that the induced metric on the hypersurface of signature change is either Riemannian or a positive semi-definite pseudo metric.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass primordial black holes: description of the stochastic charge effect in quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation sets stringent constraints on Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as a dark matter candidate in the $M \sim 10^{16} \ \mathrm{g}$ regime based on the evaporation products such as photons, electrons, and positrons. This motivates the need for rigorous modeling of the Hawking emission spectrum. Using semi-classical arguments, Page [Phys. Rev. D 16, 2402 (1977)] showed that the emission of electrons and positrons is altered due to the black hole acquiring an equal and opposite charge to the emitted particle. The Poisson fluctuations of emitted particles cause the charge $Z|e|$ to random walk, but since acquisition of charge increases the probability of the black hole emitting another charged particle of the same sign, the walk is biased toward $Z=0$, and $P(Z)$ approaches an equilibrium probability distribution with finite variance $\langle Z^2\rangle$. This paper explores how this ``stochastic charge'' phenomenon arises from quantum electrodynamics (QED) on a Schwarzschild spacetime. We prove that (except for a small Fermi blocking term) the semi-classical variance $\langle Z^2 \rangle$ agrees with the variance of a quantum operator $\langle \hat{\cal Z}^2 \rangle$, where $\hat{\cal Z}$ may be thought of as an ``atomic number'' that includes the black hole as well as charge near it (weighted by a factor of $2M/r$). In QED, the fluctuations in $\hat{\cal Z}$ do not arise from the black hole itself (whose charge remains fixed), but rather as a collective effect in the Hawking-emitted particles mediated by the long-range electromagnetic interaction. We find the rms charge $\langle Z^2\rangle^{1/2}$ asymptotes to 3.44 at small PBH masses $M \lesssim 2\times 10^{16}\,$g, declining to 2.42 at $M=5.2\times 10^{17}\,$g.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on dark energy parametrizations after DESI 2024: Persistent deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on cosmological constraints of dark energy parametrizations post-DESI 2024, suggesting potential deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This study aims to put observational constraints on EoS parametrizations beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using DESI BAO 2024 data, CMB anisotropy observations 2018, and various Pantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations. Our main goal is to check the result of DESI collaborations \cite{DESI:2024mwx} in the context of some generalizations of CPL approximation known as BA and Pade parametrizations. In general, our research can reveal any potential biases in the CPL parametrization and determine the consistency of observational data with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology or alternative dark energy models. We find that in the generalizations of CPL parametrization, the deviation from $w_{\Lambda}=-1$ is more pronounced when we utilize the combinations of DESI BAO, CMB and various Pantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields are favorite among the possible candidates for the dark energy. Most frequently discussed are those with degenerate minima at $\pm \phi_{min}$. In this paper, a slightly modified two-Higgs doublet model is taken to contain the Higgs field(s) as the dark energy candidate(s). The model considered has two non-degenerate minima at $\phi_{\pm}$, instead of one degenerate minimum at $\pm\phi_{min}$. The component fields of one SU(2) doublet ($\phi_1$) act as the standard model (SM) Higgs, while the component fields of the second doublet ($\phi_2$) are taken to be the dark energy candidates (lying in the true vacuum). It is found that one \emph{can} arrange for late time acceleration (dark energy) by using an SU(2) Higgs doublet, whose vacuum expectation value is zero, in the quintessential regime.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating charged BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating charged BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity. The motivation for considering these two fields of investigation is related to the emission of information from the black hole encoded by quantum complexity; even at zero temperature, information is still emitted. In this case, the death of the black hole only occurs classically. In this sense, the entropy of the black hole at zero temperature must still be a minimum of information that is not entirely zero. In recent investigations regarding Horndeski gravity in the AdS/BCFT correspondence, we showed a minimum entropy (residual/remaining entropy) for zero temperature. In this sense, complexity and entropy, as we will show throughout this work, provide information about the emission from a black hole even after its classical death.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a gravitational dual of a Josephson junction constructed from the AdS/BCFT correspondence. On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $Q$ with tension $\Sigma$ of the boundary CFT. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>Coport: A New Public Code for Polarized Radiative Transfer in a Covariant Framework$^\spadesuit$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativistic radiative transfer calculations are essential for comparing theoretical models of black hole accretion flows and jets with observational data. In this work, we introduce Coport, a novel public code specifically designed for covariant polarized ray-tracing radiative transfer computations in any spacetime. Written in Julia, Coport includes an interface for visualizing numerical results obtained from HARM, a publicly available implementation of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate the precision of our code by comparing its outputs with the results from a variety of established methodologies. This includes the verification against analytical solutions, the validation through thin-disk assessments, and the evaluation via thick-disk analyses. Notably, our code employs a methodology that eliminates the need for separating the computations of spacetime propagation and plasma propagation. Instead, it directly solves the coupled, covariant, polarized radiative transfer equation in curved spacetime, seamlessly integrating the effects of gravity with plasma influences. This approach sets our code apart from the existing alternatives and enhances its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor clustering fossils as a possible probe to constrain the theory of gravity, in particular the deviation of the sound speed of gravitational waves from the speed of light at high redshifts. We develop the formalism of the effective Poisson equation to include the novel phenomenological model of the scalar-tensor tidal interactions that are expected to be induced by the modification of the theory of gravity. We show that the tensor clustering fossils can arise from the propagation of gravitational waves, the growth of the large-scale structures, and the second-order contributions from the effective Poisson equation. We construct the small-scale effective Lagrangian from the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and derive the formula applicable to the tensor clustering fossils in the language of the effective field theory of dark energy. As a demonstration, we apply the formalism to the constraint on the sound speed of gravitational waves in the futuristic survey.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the cosmological redshift: insights into inhomogeneities and irreversible processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the expansion of the Universe remains a profound challenge in fundamental physics. The complexity of solving General Relativity equations in the presence of intricate, inhomogeneous flows has compelled cosmological models to rely on perturbation theory in a homogeneous FLRW background. This approach accounts for a redshift of light encompassing contributions from both the cosmological background expansion along the photon's trajectory and Doppler effects at emission due to peculiar motions. However, this computation of the redshift is not covariant, as it hinges on specific coordinate choices that may distort physical interpretations of the relativity of motion. In this study, we show that peculiar motions, when tracing the dynamics along time-like geodesics, must contribute to the redshift of light through a local volume expansion factor, in addition to the background expansion. By employing a covariant approach to redshift calculation, we address the central question of whether the cosmological principle alone guarantees that the averaged local volume expansion factor matches the background expansion. We establish that this holds true only in scenarii characterized by a reversible evolution of the Universe, where inhomogeneous expansion and compression modes mutually compensate. In the presence of irreversible processes, such as the dissipation of large-scale compression modes through matter virialization and associated entropy production, the averaged expansion factor becomes dominated by expansion in voids that cannot be compensated anymore by compression in virialized structures. Our approach shows that entropy production due to irreversible processes during the formation of structures plays the same role as an effective, time-dependent cosmological constant, i.e. dynamical dark energy, without the need to invoke new unknown physics.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty of the White Dwarf Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is a stochastic GW signal that is emitted by different populations of inspiralling binary systems containing compact objects. In the frequency range between 10^{-4} and 10^{-1} Hz it will be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, Staelens &amp; Nelemans 2024 (SN24) concluded that the white dwarf (WD) contribution to the AGWB dominates over that of black holes (BHs).
  We aim to investigate the uncertainties of the WD AGWB that arise from the use of different stellar metallicities, different star formation rate density (SFRD) models, and different binary evolution models.
  We use the code developed by SN24 to determine the WD component of the AGWB. We use a metallicity dependent SFRD based on Chruslinska et al (2019,2020,2021) to construct five different SFRD models. We use four different population models that use different common-envelope treatment and six different metallicities for each model.
  For all possible combinations, the WD component of the AGWB is dominant over other populations of compact objects. The effects of metallicity and population model are smaller than the effect of a (metallicity dependent) SFRD model. We find a range of about a factor of 5 in the level of the WD AGWB around a mid value of Omega_WD = 4 10^{-12} at 1 mHz and a shape that depends weakly on the model.
  We find an uncertainty for the WD component of the AGWB of about a factor 5. We note that there exist other uncertainties that have an effect on this signal as well. We discuss whether the turnover of the WD AGWB at 10 mHz will be detectable by LISA, and find that this is likely. We confirm the previous finding that the WD component of the AGWB dominates over other populations, in particular BHs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical search method for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-based detector data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future space-based laser interferometric detectors, such as LISA, will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) generated during the inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes (SmBBHs). The detection and characterization of GWs from SmBBHs poses a formidable data analysis challenge, arising from the large number of wave cycles that make the search extremely sensitive to mismatches in signal and template parameters in a likelihood-based approach. This makes the search for the maximum of the likelihood function over the signal parameter space an extremely difficult task. We present a data analysis method that addresses this problem using both algorithmic innovations and hardware acceleration driven by GPUs. The method follows a hierarchical approach in which a semi-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic is computed with different numbers of frequency domain partitions at different stages, with multiple particle swarm optimization (PSO) runs used in each stage for global optimization. An important step in the method is the judicious partitioning of the parameter space at each stage to improve the convergence probability of PSO and avoid premature convergence to noise-induced secondary maxima. The hierarchy of stages confines the semi-coherent searches to progressively smaller parameter ranges, with the final stage performing a search for the global maximum of the fully-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We test our method on 2.5 years of a single LISA TDI combination and find that for an injected SmBBH signal with a SNR between $\approx 11$ and $\approx 14$, the method can estimate (i) the chirp mass with a relative error of $\lesssim 0.01\%$, (ii) the time of coalescence within $\approx 100$ sec, (iii) the sky location within $\approx 0.2$ ${\rm deg}^2$, and (iv) orbital eccentricity at a fiducial signal frequency of 10 mHz with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$.

      <title>Inferring dark energy properties from the scale factor parametrisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a novel test to assess deviations from well-established concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology while inferring dark energy properties. In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' for the expansion history using the late-time cosmological observables, namely Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae. As a primary inference, we contrast the BAO compilations from the completed SDSS and the more recent DESI. We find that the former deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at a mild $\sim 2\sigma$ level while the latter is completely consistent with the standard picture when the dark energy properties are inferred. We find that the posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like, however, we demonstrate the rich phenomenology of dark energy behaviour that can be obtained in our general model wrt to the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. The impulse, spin kick, and leading-order waveforms exhibit such a nontrivial dependence. A signal of this additional structure is the change in the magnitude of the spin vector under conservative Hamiltonian evolution, similar to our previous studies in electrodynamics. These additional degrees of freedom describe dynamical mass multipoles of compact objects and decouple for black holes. We also show that the conservative impulse, spin kick and change of the additional degrees of freedom are encoded in the eikonal phase.</description>

      <title>Constraining hybrid potential scalar field cosmological model in Lyra's geometry with recent observational data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current study, we investigate a scalar field cosmological model with Lyra's geometry to explain the present cosmic expansion in a homogeneous and isotropic flat FRW universe. In Einstein's field equations, we presupposed a variable displacement vector as an element of Lyra's geometry. In the context of the conventional theory of gravity, we suggest a suitable parameterization of the scalar field's dark energy density in the hybrid function of redshift $z$, confirming the essential transition behavior of the universe from a decelerating era to the present accelerated scenario. We present constraints on model parameters using the most recent observational data sets from OHD, BAO/CMB, and Pantheon, taking Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis into account. For the proposed model, the best estimated values of parameters for the combined dataset (OHD, BAO/CMB, and Pantheon) are $ H_0 = 71.15\pm 0.26$ km/s/Mpc, $ \Omega_{m0}=0.2625\pm 0.0024$, $ \Omega_{\phi0} = 0.676\pm0.038$, $ \alpha=-0.22\pm0.13$, $n = 0.096\pm0.079$, and $k = 0.38\pm0.32$. The model exhibits a flipping nature, and the redshift transition occurs at $z_t = 0.756^{+0.005}_{-0.015}$. The current value of the decelerated parameter for the proposed model is calculated as $q_0 = -0.625^{+0.067}_{-0.085}$ for the combined dataset. Some dynamical properties of the model like energy density ($\rho_{\phi}$), scalar field pressure ($p_{\phi}$), EoS parameter of scalar field ($\omega_{\phi}$), and effective EoS parameter ($\omega_{eff}$) are analyzed and presented. Further, we have also examined the statefinder diagnosis and jerk parameters of the derived model. The total density parameter for the derived model is found to be unity which is in nice agreement with recent standard findings.</description>

      <title>Impenetrable Barriers in the Phase Space of a Particle Moving Around a Kerr Rotating Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle moving in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perspective. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits, known as Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold, and its stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space known as Lagrangian descriptors in the literature.</description>

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

      <title>pp-waves in conformal Killing gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Harada has proposed a gravitational theory which is of third order in the derivatives of the metric tensor. This has attracted some attention particularly as it predicts a late-time transition from cosmological decelaration to accelerated expansion without assuming the presence of dark energy or a non-zero cosmological constant. This theory has been dubbed conformal Killing gravity by Mantica &amp; Molinari.
  The most general exact solutions of the Harada field equations are known for a number of important physical situations: homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models, static spherically symmetric vacuum and electrovac spacetimes. These are analogues of the well-known FRWL, Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om metrics of General Relativity(GR). In this study the pp-waves in Harada's theory are studied and the most general exact solution is obtained together with its specialisation for plane waves. The generalisation from GR to Harada's theory turns out to be straightforward and the solutions only involve an extra non-propagating term. The solutions have Petrov type N (or 0) and the Ricci tensor is either zero or the Segr\'e type is [(211)] with zero eigenvalue.
  For any metric in conformal Killing gravity it is shown that more than one possible matter source can generate the solution. If the metric admits one or more Killing vectors, the ambiguity in the possible matter sources increases.</description>

      <title>Linear instability of hairy black holes in Horndeski theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horndeski theory constitutes the most general model of scalar-tensor theories. It has attracted much attention in recent years in relation with black holes, celestial dynamics, stability analysis, etc. It is important to note that, for certain subclasses of Horndeski models, one can obtain analytic solutions for the background fields. This facilitates the investigation of the corresponding stability problems in detail. In particular, we aim to determine the constraints to the model or theory under which the stability conditions can be satisfied. In this study, we focused on a subclass of Horndeski theory and a set of analytic background solutions. In addition, the odd-parity gravitational perturbation and 2nd-order Lagrangian were investigated. Through careful analysis, the instability was identified within the neighborhood of the event horizon. This allows exclusion of a specific geometry for the model. Such an instability is implanted in the structure of the corresponding Lagrangian and is not erased by simply adding numerical constraints on the coupling parameters. As a starting point of our research, the current study provides insights for further exploration of the Horndeski theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the quasinormal modes of a $5$-D black hole in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Bumblebee theory of gravity have been investigated with the help of the Pad\'e averaged higher order WKB approximation method and the validity of Hod's conjecture has been studied. It is found that the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking due to the Bumblebee field favours Hod's conjecture. But in the case of the Gauss-Bonnet term, an increase in the coupling parameter increases the chances of violation of Hod's conjecture. We further investigated the optical properties of the black hole {\it viz.}, shadow and emission rate. It is found that a black hole with a lower lifetime favours Hod's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>The cosmological significance of boundary term in non-metricity gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of metric-affine gravity, we examine the significance of the boundary term in symmetric teleparallel gravity by employing the cosmological dynamical system analysis method. We focus on the novel gravity models characterized by the functions $f(Q,C)$, where $f$ is a smooth function of the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the associated boundary term $C$. In a cosmological setting adopting three different classes of symmetric teleparallel affine connections, we investigate a model $f(Q,C)=Q^{s}+eC^{r}$, and some special cases of this model. We show that the boundary term which is added to the Einsteinian field equations (or equivalently to $f(Q)=Q$ ones) are capable of bringing forward solutions corresponding to the early accelerated expansion. This alludes the physics behind the boundary terms which usually are discarded in the most gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive a novel black hole solution surrounded by a Dehnen-(1,4,0) type dark matter halo by embedding a Schwarzschild black hole within the halo, constituting a composite dark matter-black hole system. The thermodynamics of the resulting effective black hole spacetime is then studied with particular attention to the influence of the dark matter parameters on various thermodynamic properties. We examine the specific heat and free energy to assess the thermodynamic stability of the model. Furthermore, the null geodesics and the effective potential of light rays are studied to investigate how the dark matter parameters affect these geodesics and the radii of circular orbits. The stability of circular null geodesics is analyzed using dynamical systems and Lyapunov exponents, which represents the dynamical behaviour of the circular photon orbits. Finally, we studied if the circular geodesics exhibit chaotic behaviour using the chaos-bound condition.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Shadow of slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real astronomical objects possess spin, yet deriving exact solutions for rotating black holes within gravitational theories is a formidable challenge. To understand the shadow of rotating black holes in Lorentz-violating spacetimes induced by antisymmetric tensor fields, known as Kalb-Ramond (KR) fields, we have focused on the slow-rotation approximation framework. Using this approach, we have obtained first-order rotation series solutions, which describe slowly rotating KR black holes. For this solutions, we have plotted the black hole shadow contours under various parameters using the numerical backward ray-tracing method. As the Lorentz-violating parameter increases, not only the apparent size of the black hole shadow decreases, but also the effects of rotation, such as the D-shaped structure and frame-dragging, are amplified. Furthermore, the KR field also enhances gravitational lensing, causing the shadow to occupy a larger area within the photon ring. This distinctive feature can differentiate KR gravity from general relativity. Additionally, using the latest observational data from EHT on M87* and Sgr A*, we have provided constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter of rotating KR black holes. We found that, compared to static black holes, rotating black holes allow for the presence of stronger Lorentz violation effects.</description>

Abstract: We study entanglement negativity for evaporating black hole based on the holographic model with defect brane. We introduce a defect extremal surface formula for entanglement negativity. Based on partial reduction, we show the equivalence between defect extremal surface formula and island formula for entanglement negativity in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. Extending the study to the model of eternal black hole plus CFT bath, we find that black hole-black hole negativity decreases until vanishing, left black hole-left radiation negativity is always a constant, radiation-radiation negativity increases and then saturates at a time later than Page time. In all the time dependent cases, defect extremal surface formula agrees with island formula.</description>

      <title>Charge superradiance on charged BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superradiant scattering for a charged scalar field subject to Robin (mixed) boundary conditions on a charged BTZ black hole background. Scalar field modes having a real frequency do not exhibit superradiant scattering, independent of the boundary conditions applied. For scalar field modes with a complex frequency, no superradiant scattering occurs if the black hole is static. After exploring some regions of the parameter space, we provide evidence for the existence of superradiantly scattered modes with complex frequencies for a charged and rotating BTZ black hole. Most of the superradiantly scattered modes we find satisfy Robin (mixed) boundary conditions, but there are also superradiantly scattered modes with complex frequencies satisfying Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We explore the effect of the black hole and scalar field charge on the outgoing energy flux of these superradiantly scattered modes, and also investigate their stability.</description>

      <title>Present and future of CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the present state and planned updates of CosmoLattice, a cutting-edge code for lattice simulations of non-linear dynamics of scalar-gauge field theories in an expanding background. We first review current capabilities of the code, including the simulation of interacting singlet scalars and of Abelian and non-Abelian scalar-gauge theories. We also comment on new features recently implemented, such as the simulation of gravitational waves from scalar and gauge fields. Secondly, we discuss new extensions of CosmoLattice that we plan to release publicly. On the one hand, we comment on new physics modules, which include axion-gauge interactions $\phi F \widetilde{F}$, non-minimal gravitational couplings $\phi^2 R$, creation and evolution of cosmic defect networks, and magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD). On the other hand, we discuss new technical features, including evolvers for non-canonical interactions, arbitrary initial conditions, simulations in 2+1 dimensions, and higher accuracy spatial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Detecting Dark Matter Substructures on Small Scales with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose measuring the arrival time difference of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) along two adjacent sightlines as a new probe to dark matter substructures on scales down to $\sim 1\,$AU. We discuss two observational scenarios in which it may be possible to place interesting constraints on such models through monitoring repeating FRB sources: 1) By sending radio receivers to space to form a baseline of tens of AU or more and measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between receivers. 2) By measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between two lensed images of one strongly lensed repeater. In both scenarios, obtaining interesting constraints requires correlating the voltage time series to measure the radio-signal arrival time to sub-nanosecond precision. We find that two radio dishes separated by $20\,$AU may be sensitive to the enhancement of small-scale structures at $\sim 10^{-8}M_\odot$ masses in the QCD axion dark matter scenario or from an early epoch of matter-domination with a reheating temperature up to 60 MeV. Other dark matter models such as those composed of $\sim 10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes produced during inflation would also be probed by this method. We further show that a strong lensing situation of multiple images provides an equivalent $\sim 2000\,$AU baseline, which can be much more sensitive but with the uncertainty that intervening ISM decoherence may degrade the timing precision and that spatial variation in the FRB emission spot may result in confounding signals. We show that the lensing magnifications of Type Ia supernovea constrain a similar quantity to such FRB timing, with present limits being equivalent to ruling out the same parameter space that would be probed by a $0.14~$AU baseline.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization for Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical saddles of three-dimensional gravity via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find out the complex geometries corresponding to the semi-classical saddles of threedimensional quantum gravity by making use of the known results of dual conformal field theory (CFT), which is effectively given by Liouville field theory. We examine both the cases with positive and negative cosmological constants. We determine the set of semi-classical saddles to choose from the homotopy argument in the Chern-Simons formulation combined with CFT results and provide strong supports from the mini-superspace approach to the quantum gravity. For the case of positive cosmological constant, partial results were already obtained in our previous works, and they are consistent with the current ones. For the case of negative cosmological constant, we identify the geometry corresponding a semi-classical saddle with three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space dressed with imaginary radius three-dimensional spheres. The geometry is generically unphysical, but we argue that the fact itself does not lead to any problems.</description>

      <title>$H_0$-tension in the classical limit of Big Bang quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble expansion of the Universe is considered in the classical limit of Big Bang quantum cosmology. Consistency with general relativity obtains in an IR coupling to the bare cosmological constant parameterized by the Hubble horizon. The resulting effective dark energy $\Lambda$ has a simple meaning as a relic of the Big Bang, breaking time-translation invariance on a Hubble time-scale. We identify $\Lambda$ with the trace $J$ of the Schouten tensor, allowing for an analytic solution $H(z)$ beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Subject to the {\em Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations} (BAO), $J$CDM predicts $H_0$ to be $\sqrt{6/5}$ times $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. $J$CDM is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM fit to the {\em Planck} 2018 power spectrum of the CMB, while alleviating the $H_0$-tension with the Local Distance Ladder.</description>

      <title>Surface growth approach for bulk reconstruction in AdS/BCFT correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the surface growth scheme in AdS spacetime with a boundary in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum field theory in a box with moving boundaries: A numerical study of the Dynamical Casimir Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early Universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, we consider the near-accurate solutions of inflationary models and compare our results with the pre-existing ones. It mainly incorporates two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution, and, thus, the end of inflation; and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>
