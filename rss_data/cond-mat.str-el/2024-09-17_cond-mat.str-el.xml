      <title>Negative charge transfer energy in correlated compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In correlated compounds containing cations in high formal oxidation states (assigned by assuming that anions attain full valence shells), the energy of ligand to cation charge transfer can become small or even negative. This yields compounds with a high degree of covalence and can lead to a self-doping of holes into the ligand states of the valence band. Such compounds are of particular topical interest, as highly studied perovskite oxides containing trivalent nickel or tetravalent iron are negative charge transfer systems, as are nickel-containing lithium ion battery cathode materials. In this report, we review the topic of negative charge transfer energy, with an emphasis on plots and diagrams as analysis tools, in the spirit of the celebrated Tanabe-Sugano diagrams which are the focus of this Special Topics Issue.</description>

      <title>Ground State Phase Diagram of $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinct from the $\text{SU}(2)$ case, the fermionic systems with $\text{SU}(N)$ symmetry are expected to exhibit novel physics, such as exotic singlet formation. Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n&lt;1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</description>

      <title>Inverted duality of Hubbard model and an equation for the Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model, a cornerstone in the field of condensed matter physics, serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of these complex systems. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy. This derivation not only enriches the theoretical foundation of the Hubbard model but also leads to the development of a concise analytical expression for the Mott transition. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and potentially new insights into the dynamics of electron correlations and phase transitions in condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Concurrence and entanglement on a 16-site spin-1/2 pyrochlore cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the entanglement of the ground state of a 16-site spin-1/2 pyrochlore cluster in the quantum spin ice regime via various calculations of ${\cal I}$-concurrence. Exact ground state solutions to a quantum spin Hamiltonian with four nearest-neighbour exchange parameters were obtained using exact diagonalization. We present results for the ground state ${\cal I}$-concurrence in a region within the parameter space of the model where the ground state is a singlet. We discuss variations in the ${\cal I}$-concurrence in the context of the composition of the ground state and we demonstrate how a lattice distortion disentangles the state.</description>

      <title>Many-body Keldysh Crossover in the DC-driven Haldane Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study nonlinear processes driven by a DC spin-electric field in the antiferromagnetic spin-1 Heisenberg model starting from the ground state in the Haldane phase. The DC spin-electric field generates finite spin current and accumulation since the symmetry protected topological order is destroyed by the field. We find two microscopic mechanisms responsible for the breakdown and a crossover between them: In weak fields, tripron-antitripron pair creation occurs through the tunneling mechanism, and in strong fields, the system is described by an effective Hamiltonian breaking the protecting symmetries. We analyze the numerically obtained results in terms of the Dykhne--Davis--Pechukas theory and Floquet theory, verifying the universal picture of the many-body Keldysh crossover in the DC-driven quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Structure and magnetic properties of a family of two-leg spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, and Gd-Ho) with strong rung interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin ladders represent a special type of low-dimensional magnets allowing the study of dimensional crossover from one-dimensional spin chain to two-dimensional square-lattice spin systems, and different magnetic ground states can emerge in such system depending on the exchange interaction parameters of rungs and legs of the ladder. Even intensive investigations have been performed on the 3d transition-metal-based spin ladder compounds, but the materials constructed by the rare-earth ions are still rare. Herein, we report a family of RE-based spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE=Pr,Nd,Gd-Ho) crystallized into the monoclinic structure with the space group C2/c. The structural analysis reveals that the RE ions form structurally a two-leg spin ladder motif, which are bridged through the RE-O-RE pathways and RE-O-Ge-O-RE routes along the rung and leg directions, respectively. Moreover, the rung distance within the RE2O12 dimer is much shorter than the leg distance, suggesting Ba2RE2Ge4O13 to be a strong-rung spin ladder system. All the synthesized Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE=Pr,Nd,Gd-Ho) compounds exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 1.8K. Among the family members, Ba2Dy2Ge4O13 can be described by Jeff=1/2 Kramers doublet states, which exhibits the coexistence of short-range spin correlations maximized at Tsr~2.4K and long-range AFM order at TN=0.81K indicated by the low temperature specific heat data. The short-range spin correlation is ascribed to the development of rung exchange interactions of Dy2O12 dimers and the long-rang AFM order is related to the enhanced leg-or inter-laddder couplings at reduced temperatures. This family of Ba2RE2Ge4O13 compounds thereby provide a rare platform to investigate the novel spin ladder physics with spin-orbit entangled Jeff=1/2 moments beyond the 3d TM-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic and chemical pressure driven crossover from commensurate to the incommensurate state of the Weyl semimetal Mn$_{3+x}$Sn$_{1-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in the non-collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of the Weyl semimetal Mn$_3$Sn generates enormous interest in uncovering the entanglement between the real space magnetic ordering and the momentum space band structure. Previous studies show that changes in the magnetic structure induced by the application of hydrostatic and chemical pressure can significantly affect the AHC of Mn$_{3+x}$Sn$_{1-x}$ system. Here, we employ the muon spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu^+$SR) technique to systematically investigate the evolution of different magnetic states in the Mn$_{3+x}$Sn$_{1-x}$ as a function of hydrostatic and chemical pressure. We find two muon sites experimentally, which is also supported by our \textit{ab initio} calculations. Our $\mu^+$SR experiments affirm that the $x = 0.05$ compound exhibits a commensurate magnetic state throughout the magnetically ordered phase below the Neel temperature $T_N \approx 420$~K in ambient pressure. In contrast, we observe an incommensurate magnetic state below $T_{IC} \sim 175$~K when a hydrostatic pressure of 1.5~GPa is applied. A similar transition from the commensurate to incommensurate state is also found with chemical pressure for $x = 0.04$ and $x = 0.03$, using $\mu^+$SR and elastic neutron scattering experiments. Using band structure calculations, we have shown the emergence of Fermi nesting in Mn$_3$Sn and the subsequent development of incommensurate magnetic ordering under hydrostatic/chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Magnetization dependent anisotropic topological properties in EuCuP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between magnetism and nontrivial topological band structure serves as a unique venue for discovering exotic topological properties. Combining magnetotransport measurements and first-principles calculations, we unveil herein that the hexagonal EuCuP holds topologically trivial state in the paramagnetic structure, while strong magnetization dependent anisotropic topological states in the spin-polarization structures. Specifically, it hosts a trivial topological state in the in-plane spin-polarization structure, while a Weyl semimetal state in the out-of-plane spin-polarization structure. Our scaling analysis suggests that the intrinsic Berry curvature in the spin-polarization structures can account for the observed large anisotropic anomalous Hall effect. First-principles calculations show that the magnetization and the spin-orbit coupling simultaneously play essential roles for the appearance of the four pairs of Weyl points in the out-of-plane spin-polarization structure. Our work therefore establishes in EuCuP the intimate relation between magnetism and the nontrivial topological states, which would be instructive for future study on this key issue of topological physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quasielastic scattering contribution in the centrosymmetric multi-$\mathbf{q}$ helimagnet SrFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric compounds which host three-dimensional topological spin structures comprise a distinct subclass of materials in which multiple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic order is stabilized by anisotropy and bond frustration in contrast to the more common path of antisymmetric exchange interactions. Here we investigate static and dynamic magnetic properties of the cubic perovskite SrFeO$_3$ $\unicode{x2013}$ a rare example of a centrosymmetric material hosting two types of topological spin textures: skyrmion- and hedgehog-lattice phases. Our detailed magnetization and dilatometry measurements describe the domain selection processes and phase transitions in SrFeO$_3$. Spin excitations are investigated using inelastic neutron scattering for all three zero-field phases. In the higher-temperature ordered phases, high-energy magnons increasingly lose coherence, so that spin fluctuations are dominated by a distinct quasielastic component at low energies. We anticipate that this could be generic to symmetric helimagnets in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: an efficient quantum Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has achieved huge success in pure ground states of quantum many-body systems, numerical explorations on mixed states remain limited, despite the fact that most real-world systems are non-isolated. Meanwhile, entanglement negativity, as a rarely computable entanglement monotone for mixed states, is significant in characterizing mixed-state entanglement, such as in systems with two disconnected regions, dissipation or at finite temperature. However, efficient numerical approaches are scarce to calculate this quantity in large-scale and high-dimensional systems, especially when we need to access how it varies with certain parameters to study critical behaviors. Within the reweight-annealing frame, we present an accessible and efficient QMC algorithm, which is able to achieve the values as well as tracking the variation of the R\'enyi version of entanglement negativity on some specified parameter path. Our algorithm makes it feasible to directly study the role that entanglement plays at the critical point and in different phases for mixed states in high dimensions numerically. In addition, this method is accessible and easy to parallelize on computers. Through this method, different intrinsic mechanisms in quantum and thermal criticalities with the same universal class have been revealed clearly through the numerical calculations on R\'enyi negativity.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Fragmentation in the Chiral Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials that display increasing degrees of Hilbert space fragmentation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics. We also develop a systematic understanding of the unconventional symmetries giving rise to fragmentation and use them to classify the possible fragmentation patterns. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum.</description>

      <title>Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop phases on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto, topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less studied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct in-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model, both of which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev interaction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively. We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction, topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Enforced Spinor Pairing Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Scrambling, Chaos, Sensitivity, and Emergent State Designs</title>

Abstract: Understanding quantum chaos is of profound theoretical interest and carries significant implications for various applications, from condensed matter physics to quantum error correction. Recently, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to quantify quantum chaos. For a given quantum system, the OTOCs measure incompatibility between an operator evolved in the Heisenberg picture and an unevolved operator. In the first part of this thesis, we employ OTOCs to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-Komogorov-Arnold-Moser (non-KAM) system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model that displays stochastic webs in the phase space. The OTOC analysis is followed by a study of quantum Fisher information (QFI) at the resonances and a comparison with the non-resonance cases. We shall show that scaling of the QFI in time is enhanced at the resonances, making the dynamics of the non-KAM systems good candidates for quantum sensing. In the following chapter, we study the OTOCs in a bipartite system of kicked coupled tops with a special focus on the mixed phase space OTOC dynamics. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of quantum state designs as a signature of quantum chaos and the role of symmetries in this phenomenon. Recently proposed projected ensemble framework utilizes quantum chaos as a resource to construct approximate higher-order state designs. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the emergence of quantum state designs remain under-explored. We thoroughly investigate this by demonstrating the interplay between symmetries and measurements in constructing approximate state designs. Finally, we outline a few open directions relevant to the current thesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in systems with $\Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks as large as $n\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The $z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations in the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure at larger $\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that the distribution of $z$-magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current is maximized.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetries in ordered phases and applications to quantum disordering</title>

Abstract: We explore the rich landscape of higher-form and non-invertible symmetries that emerge at low energies in generic ordered phases. Using that their charge is carried by homotopy defects (i.e., domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc.), in the absence of domain walls we find that their symmetry defects in ${D}$-dimensional spacetime are described by ${(D-1)}$-representations of a ${(D-1)}$-group that depends only on the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) pattern of the ordered phase. These emergent symmetries are not spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. We show that spontaneously breaking them induces a phase transition into a nontrivial disordered phase that can have symmetry-enriched (non-)abelian topological orders, photons, and even more emergent symmetries. This SSB transition is between two distinct SSB phases$\unicode{x2013}$an ordinary and a generalized one$\unicode{x2013}$making it a possible generalized deconfined quantum critical point. We also investigate the 't Hooft anomalies of these emergent symmetries and conjecture that there is always a mixed anomaly between them and the microscopic symmetry spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. One way this anomaly can manifest is through the fractionalization of the microscopic symmetry's quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that even the most exotic generalized symmetries emerge in ordinary phases and provide a valuable framework for characterizing them and their transitions.</description>

      <title>Topological and magnetic properties of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of electronic correlations on the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model using the real-space density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We introduce a method to probe topological phase transitions in systems with strong correlations using DMRG, substantiated by an unsupervised machine learning methodology that analyzes the orbital structure of the real-space edges. Including the full multi-orbital Hubbard interaction term, we construct a phase diagram as a function of a gap parameter ($m$) and the Hubbard interaction strength ($U$) via exact DMRG simulations on $N\times 4$ cylinders. Our analysis confirms that the topological phase persists in the presence of interactions, consistent with previous studies, but it also reveals an intriguing phase transition from a paramagnetic to a stripey antiferromagnetic topological insulator. The combination of the magnetic structure factor, strength of magnetic moments, and the orbitally resolved density, provides real-space information on both topology and magnetism in a strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum anomalous Hall phases in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene moir\'e structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkable recent experiments on the moir\'e structure formed by pentalayer rhombohedral graphene aligned with a hexagonal Boron-Nitride substrate report the discovery of a zero field fractional quantum hall effect. These "(Fractional) Quantum Anomalous Hall" ((F)QAH) phases occur for one sign of a perpendicular displacement field, and correspond, experimentally, to full or partial filling of a valley polarized Chern-$1$ band. Such a band is absent in the non-interacting band structure. Here we show that electron-electron interactions play a crucial role, and present microscopic theoretical calculations demonstrating the emergence of a nearly flat, isolated, Chern-$1$ band and FQAH phases in this system. We also study the four and six-layer analogs and identify parameters where a nearly flat isolated Chern-$1$ band emerges which may be suitable to host FQAH physics.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic device for a realization of the Topological Kondo effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for anyons is a field of immense interest owing to its potential application in the field of quantum information. Quantum critical Kondo impurities constitute one possible platform for their realization and Topological Kondo effect (TKE) by virtue of remaining critical in the presence of perturbations, seems to be especially promising in this regard. In this paper we discuss practical steps for a realization of TKE with a relatively high Kondo temperature $T_K$. Its central feature is the so-called Majorana-Cooper box (MCB) and we argue that a particular type of iron-based topological superconductor is especially suitable for realization of TKE. Once MCB is available one needs to connect it to external metallic leads to produce TKE. A relatively high value of the Kondo temperature $T_K$ is then aided by a large superconducting gap of the iron-based superconductor. We give estimates for $T_K$, for the cases of both isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings of MCB with the leads.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

We showed its exponential convergence for half-filled non-fermi liquids phase at $\beta\mathrm{t}=4$ and presented several exemplary parameters away from half-filling, including $\mathrm{U}/\mathrm{t}=9$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Observation of the scaling dimension of fractional quantum Hall anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional quasiparticles emerging in the fractional quantum Hall regime present the challenge of observing their exotic properties unambiguously. Although the fractional charge of quasiparticles has been demonstrated since nearly three decades, the first convincing evidence of their anyonic quantum statistics has only recently been obtained and, so far, the so-called scaling dimension that determines the quasiparticles propagation dynamics remains elusive. In particular, while the non-linearity of the tunneling quasiparticle current should reveal their scaling dimension, the measurements fail to match theory, arguably because this observable is not robust to non-universal complications. Here we expose the scaling dimension from the thermal noise to shot noise crossover, and observe an agreement with expectations. Measurements are fitted to the predicted finite temperature expression involving both the quasiparticles scaling dimension and their charge, in contrast to previous charge investigations focusing on the high bias shot noise regime. A systematic analysis, repeated on multiple constrictions and experimental conditions, consistently matches the theoretical scaling dimensions for the fractional quasiparticles emerging at filling factors 1/3, 2/5 and 2/3. This establishes a central property of fractional quantum Hall anyons, and demonstrates a powerful and complementary window into exotic quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how local distortions determine the functional properties of high entropy materials, containing five or more elements at a crystallographic site, is an open challenge. We address this for a compositionally complex spinel oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$). By comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure on $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ along with density functional theory calculations for multiple configurations, we find that the element-specific distortions go beyond the first neighbor. Specifically, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion present in CuCr$_2$O$_4$ is found to be completely suppressed in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$. Instead, there is a broad distribution of Cu-O and Cu-Cr bond distances while other $A$-O distances acquire certain specific values. This study demonstrates the additional flexibility of a cationic sublattice in maintaining a uniform long-range structure, in contrast to previous reports showing only the accommodative anionic sublattice. Remarkably, despite the presence of multiple magnetic ions and variable bond lengths, the mean field magnetic interactions of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ exhibit a striking resemblance to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This compelling observation originates from the comparability of bond lengths around Cr in both materials. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the impact of local structural distortions in compositionally complex quantum materials, enabling the targeted design with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations. We show how to solve these Sylvester equations without knowledge of the eigenstates of the undriven many-body system, using the driven Hubbard model as an example. In the limit of high driving frequencies, these solutions reduce to the well-known high-frequency limit of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. We anticipate this method will be useful for describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for number-conserving bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>
