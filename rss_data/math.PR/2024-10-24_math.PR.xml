      <title>A Fuzzy Decomposition Method to Establish Functional Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to establish functional inequalities via fuzzy decomposition on the state space, which generalizes earlier results dealing with exact partitions of the state space. Given a reversible Markov chain on a finite state space, we define its projection chain and restriction chains from classes of a fuzzy partition on the state space. The Poincar\'e, log-Sobolev and modified log-Sobolev inequalities associated with the original chain can be estimated from those of its projection chain and restriction chains which tend to have simpler structures and hence easier to work with. An application of this generalization is presented in which the fuzzy decomposition method applies but its exact partitioning counterpart does not.</description>

      <title>On Transient Probabilities of Fractional Birth-Death Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fractional birth-death process with state dependent birth and death rates. It is defined using a system of fractional differential equations that generalizes the classical birth-death process introduced by Feller (1939). We obtain the closed form expressions for its transient probabilities using Adomian decomposition method. In this way, we obtain the unknown transient probabilities for the classical birth-death process (see Feller (1968), p. 454). Its various distributional properties are studied. For the case of linear birth and death rates, the obtained results are verified with the existing results. Also, we discuss the cumulative births in the fractional linear birth-death process. Later, we consider a time-changed linear birth-death process where we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution function of its extinction time at zero.</description>

      <title>Cutoff in total variation for the shelf shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of a popular shuffling machine known as the shelf shuffler. It is a modified version of a $2m$-handed riffle shuffle ($m=10$ in casinos) in which a deck of $n$ cards is split multinomially into $2m$ piles, the even-numbered piles are reversed, and then cards are dropped from piles proportionally to their sizes. We prove that $\frac{5}{4} \log_{2m} n$ shuffles are necessary and sufficient to mix in total variation, and a cutoff occurs with constant window size. We also determine the cutoff profile in terms of the total variation distance between two shifted normal random variables.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Critical Multitype Bellman-Harris Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a two-type critical branching particle system in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, where particles follow symmetric stable motions, with type-dependent lifetimes and offspring distributions. Our main result is the convergence as $t\to\infty$ of the particle system to a non-trivial limiting population, focusing on two cases: (1) all particle lifetimes have finite mean, or (2) one type has a lifetime distribution with a heavy tail, while the others have finite mean. This complements previous results on extinction \cite{Kevei}. Using the Extended Final Value Theorem, we prove the existence of a limiting distribution for the particle system. The non extinction of the limiting population is demonstrated using a technique inspired in \cite{Fino}. These results describe the long-term behavior of the particle system, highlighting the interaction between mobility, longevity, and offspring variability. Additionally, the study of a particle system with a finite number of types would follow analogously with the techniques presented here. Our approach introduces new techniques for the asymptotic study of critical multitype branching processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concatenation of Markov processes. Our primary concern is to utilize processes constructed in this manner for Monte Carlo integration. To enable this using conventional methods, it is essential to demonstrate the Markov property and invariance with respect to a given target distribution. We provide mild sufficient conditions for this. Our main result is the identification of the generator of the concatenation of Markov processes. This result provides the theoretical foundation for Monte Carlo methods based on this construction.</description>

      <title>Degree counts in random simplicial complexes of the preferential attachment type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical preferential attachment random graph model to random simplicial complexes. At each stage of the model, we choose one of the existing $k$-simplices with probability proportional to its $k$-degree. The chosen $k$-simplex then forms a $(k+1)$-simplex with a newly arriving vertex. We establish a strong law of large numbers for the degree counts across multiple dimensions. The limiting probability mass function is expressed as a mixture of mass functions of different types of negative binomial random variables. This limiting distribution has power-law characteristics and we explore the limiting extremal dependence of the degree counts across different dimensions in the framework of multivariate regular variation. Finally, we prove multivariate weak convergence, under appropriate normalization, of degree counts in different dimensions, of ordered $k$-simplices. The resulting weak limit can be represented as a function of independent linear birth processes with immigration.</description>

      <title>Extremal Eigenvalues of Random Kernel Matrices with Polynomial Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral norm of random kernel matrices with polynomial scaling, where the number of samples scales polynomially with the data dimension. In this regime, Lu and Yau (2022) proved that the empirical spectral distribution converges to the additive free convolution of a semicircle law and a Marcenko-Pastur law. We demonstrate that the random kernel matrix can be decomposed into a "bulk" part and a low-rank part. The spectral norm of the "bulk" part almost surely converges to the edge of the limiting spectrum.
  In the special case where the random kernel matrices correspond to the inner products of random tensors, the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Marcenko-Pastur law. We prove that the largest and smallest eigenvalues converge to the corresponding spectral edges of the Marcenko-Pastur law.</description>

      <title>The identification of diffusions from imperfect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of an $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued diffusion $X$ when a running function of it, say $h(X_t)$, is observed. A point-wise observation of the process (in other words, observing $h(X_t)$ in isolation) cannot identify $X_t$ unless the $h$ is injective. However observing $h(X_s)$ on a small interval $[t,t+\varepsilon]$ can be enough to determine $X_t$ exactly. The paper contain results that expand on this idea; in particular, a property of `fine total asymmetry' of twice continuously differentiable $h$ is introduced that depends on the fine topology of potential theory and that is both necessary and sufficient for $X$ to be adapted to a natural right-continuous filtration generated by the observations. This particular filtration, though augmented with null sets, does not depend on the distribution of $X_0$. For real-analytic $h$ the property reduces to simple asymmetry; that is, there is no nontrivial affine isometry $\kappa$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $h = h \circ \kappa$. A second result concerns the case where $X_0$ is given and $h$ is merely Borel; then $X$ is adapted to an augmented filtration generated by the observation process $(h(X_t))_{t\geq 0}$ if $h$ is `locally invertible' on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ dense in the fine topology on $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Random $2$-SAT: The set of atoms of the limiting empirical marginal distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the set of atoms of the limiting empirical marginal distribution in the random $2$-SAT model is $\mathbb Q \cap (0,1)$, for all clause-to-variable densities up to the satisfiability threshold. While for densities up to $1/2$, the measure is purely discrete, we additionally establish the existence of a nontrivial continuous part for any density in $(1/2, 1)$. Our proof is based on the construction of a random variable with the correct distribution as the the root marginal of a multi-type Galton-Watson tree, along with a subsequent analysis of the resulting almost sure recursion.</description>

      <title>A coupling between random walks in random environments and Brox's diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a properly rescaled version of Sinai's random walk converges in distribution to Brox's diffusion. In this article we quantify this convergence by considering a specific coupling between Sinai's walk and Brox's diffusion. Our method relies on convergence results for martingale problems considered in the rough path setting.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_\mathrm{op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions becomes exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish for the first time that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the typical semicircle law. Our proofs rely on deriving concentration inequalities and large deviation properties for the law of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints, extending results in the literature and offering insights of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to hydrodynamics for long-range generalized exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of generalized long-range exclusion processes evolving either on $\mathbb Z$ or on a finite lattice with an open boundary. The jump rates are given in terms of a general kernel depending on both the departure and destination sites, and it is such that the particle displacement has an infinite expectation, but some tail bounds are satisfied. We study the superballisitic scaling limit of the particle density and prove that its space-time evolution is concentrated on the set of weak solutions to a non-local transport equation. Since the stationary states of the dynamics are unknown, we develop a new approach to such a limit relying only on the algebraic structure of the Markovian generator.</description>

      <title>On the lumpability of tree-valued Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees constitute an interesting class of objects for stochastic processes due to the non-standard nature of the space they inhabit. In particular, many statistical applications require the construction of Markov processes on the space of trees, whose cardinality grows superexponentially with the number of leaves considered. We investigate whether certain lower-dimensional projections of tree space preserve the Markov property in tree-valued Markov processes. We study exact lumpability of tree shapes and $\varepsilon$-lumpability of clades, exploiting the combinatorial structure of the SPR graph to obtain bounds on the lumping error under the random walk and Metropolis-Hastings processes. Finally, we show how to use these results in empirical investigation, leveraging exact and $\varepsilon$-lumpability to improve Monte Carlo estimation of tree-related quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-points correlation function for several boundary-driven interacting particle systems. Our goal is to show that the time evolution of that correlation function is solution to a partial differential equation that can be written in terms of the generator of a two-dimensional random walk, whose jump rates are model dependent. From this, we deduce an asymptotic independence which is shared by many models.</description>

      <title>Large graph limits of local matching algorithms on uniform random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a large-graph limit estimate of the matching coverage for several matching algorithms, on general graphs generated by the configuration model. For a wide class of {\em local} matching algorithms, namely, algorithms that only use information on the immediate neighborhood of the explored nodes, we propose a joint construction of the graph by the configuration model, and of the resulting matching on the latter graph. This leads to a generalization in infinite dimension of the differential equation method of Wormald: We keep track of the matching algorithm over time by a measure-valued CTMC, for which we prove the convergence, to the large-graph limit, to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit, identified as the unique solution of a system of ODE's in the space of integer measures. Then, the asymptotic proportion of nodes covered by the matching appears as a simple function of that solution. We then make this solution explicit for three particular local algorithms: the classical {\sc greedy} algorithm, and then the {\sc uni-min} and {\sc uni-max} algorithms, two variants of the greedy algorithm that select, as neighbor of any explored node, its neighbor having the least (respectively largest) residual degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum is a popular variant of stochastic gradient descent, which has recently been reported to have a close relationship with the underdamped Langevin diffusion. In this paper, we establish a quantitative error estimate between them in the 1-Wasserstein and total variation distances.</description>

      <title>Sketching, Moment Estimation, and the L\'evy-Khintchine Representation Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $d$-dimensional turnstile streaming model, a frequency vector $\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{x}(1),\ldots,\mathbf{x}(n))\in (\mathbb{R}^d)^n$ is updated entry-wisely over a stream. We consider the problem of \emph{$f$-moment estimation} for which one wants to estimate $$f(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{v\in[n]}f(\mathbf{x}(v))$$ with a small-space sketch.
  In this work we present a simple and generic scheme to construct sketches with the novel idea of hashing indices to \emph{L\'evy processes}, from which one can estimate the $f$-moment $f(\mathbf{x})$ where $f$ is the \emph{characteristic exponent} of the L\'evy process. The fundamental \emph{L\'evy-Khintchine{} representation theorem} completely characterizes the space of all possible characteristic exponents, which in turn characterizes the set of $f$-moments that can be estimated by this generic scheme.
  The new scheme has strong explanatory power. It unifies the construction of many existing sketches ($F_0$, $L_0$, $L_2$, $L_\alpha$, $L_{p,q}$, etc.) and it implies the tractability of many nearly periodic functions that were previously unclassified. Furthermore, the scheme can be conveniently generalized to multidimensional cases ($d\geq 2$) by considering multidimensional L\'evy processes and can be further generalized to estimate \emph{heterogeneous moments} by projecting different indices with different L\'evy processes. We conjecture that the set of tractable functions can be characterized using the L\'evy-Khintchine representation theorem via what we called the \emph{Fourier-Hahn-L\'evy} method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Impulse Control for Cyber Risk Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an optimal impulse control problem wherein an electronic device owner strategically calibrates protection levels against cyber attacks. Utilizing epidemiological compartment models, we qualitatively characterize the dynamics of cyber attacks within the network. We determine the optimal protective measures against effective hacking by formulating and solving a stochastic control problem with optimal switching. We demonstrate that the value function for the cluster owner constitutes a viscosity solution to a system of coupled variational inequalities associated with a fully coupled reflected backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive algorithm alongside a verification procedure to ascertain the optimal timing for network protection across various cyber attack scenarios. Our findings are illustrated through numerical approximations employing deep Galerkin methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). We visualize the optimal protection strategies in the context of two distinct attack scenarios: (1) a constant cyber attack, (2) an exogenous cyber attack strategy modeled with a Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Gromov-Wasserstein Alignment with Applications to Testing Graph Isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance enables comparing metric measure spaces based solely on their internal structure, making it invariant to isomorphic transformations. This property is particularly useful for comparing datasets that naturally admit isomorphic representations, such as unlabelled graphs or objects embedded in space. However, apart from the recently derived empirical convergence rates for the quadratic GW problem, a statistical theory for valid estimation and inference remains largely obscure. Pushing the frontier of statistical GW further, this work derives the first limit laws for the empirical GW distance across several settings of interest: (i)~discrete, (ii)~semi-discrete, and (iii)~general distributions under moment constraints under the entropically regularized GW distance. The derivations rely on a novel stability analysis of the GW functional in the marginal distributions. The limit laws then follow by an adaptation of the functional delta method. As asymptotic normality fails to hold in most cases, we establish the consistency of an efficient estimation procedure for the limiting law in the discrete case, bypassing the need for computationally intensive resampling methods. We apply these findings to testing whether collections of unlabelled graphs are generated from distributions that are isomorphic to each other.</description>

      <title>Ising model on a Galton-Watson tree with a sparse random external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a supercritical Galton-Watson tree $\mathbf{T}_n$ of depth $n$ with a sparse random external field, given by a collection of i.i.d. Bernouilli random variables with vanishing parameter $p_n$. This may me viewed as a toy model for the Ising model on a configuration model with a few interfering external vertices carrying a plus spin: the question is to know how many (or how few) interfering vertices are enough to influence the whole graph. Our main result consists in providing a necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters $(p_n)_{n\geq 0}$ for the root of $\mathbf{T}_n$ to remain magnetized in the large $n$ limit. Our model is closely related to the Ising model on a (random) pruned sub-tree $\mathbf{T}_n^*$ with plus boundary condition; one key result is that this pruned tree turns out to be an inhomogeneous, $n$-dependent, Branching Process. We then use standard tools such as tree recursions and non-linear capacities to study the Ising model on this sequence of Galton-Watson trees; one difficulty is that the offspring distributions of $\mathbf{T}_n^*$, in addition to vary along the generations $0\leq k \leq n-1$, also depend on~$n$.</description>

      <title>Information-Based Martingale Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized arcade processes are a class of continuous stochastic processes that interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between any given ordered set of random variables, at fixed pre-specified times. Utilizing these processes as generators of partial information, a class of continuous-time martingale -- the filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) -- is constructed. FAMs interpolate through a sequence of target random variables, which form a discrete-time martingale. The research presented in this paper treats the problem of selecting the worst martingale coupling for given, convexly ordered, probability measures contingent on the paths of FAMs that are constructed using the martingale coupling. This optimization problem, that we term the information-based martingale optimal transport problem (IB-MOT), can be viewed from different perspectives. It can be understood as a model-free construction of FAMs, in the case where the coupling is not determined, a priori. It can also be considered from the vantage point of optimal transport (OT), where the problem is concerned with introducing a noise factor in martingale optimal transport, similarly to how the entropic regularization of optimal transport introduces noise in OT. The IB-MOT problem is static in its nature, since it is concerned with finding a coupling, but a corresponding dynamical solution can be found by considering the FAM constructed with the identified optimal coupling. Existence and uniqueness of its solution are shown, and an algorithm for empirical measures is proposed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new spanning tree model called the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE), which interpolates between the uniform spanning tree and the minimum spanning tree as the inverse temperature (disorder strength) $\beta$ varies. On the complete graph with $n$ vertices and i.i.d.\ uniform disorder variables on the edges, we identify: (1) a low disorder regime with $\beta \leq C n/\log n$, where the diameter of the random spanning tree is typically of order $n^{1/2}$, the same as for the uniform spanning tree; (2) a high disorder regime with $\beta \geq n^{4/3} \log n$, where the diameter is typically of order $n^{1/3}$, the same as for the minimum spanning tree. We conjecture that for $\beta=n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 4/3)$, the diameter is of order $n^{\gamma+o(1)}$ for some $\gamma=\gamma(\alpha)$ strictly between $1/2$ and $1/3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probability measures on the sphere form an important class of statistical models and are used, for example, in modeling directional data or shapes. Due to their widespread use, but also as an algorithmic building block, efficient sampling of distributions on the sphere is highly desirable. We propose a shrinkage based and an idealized geodesic slice sampling Markov chain, designed to generate approximate samples from distributions on the sphere. In particular, the shrinkage-based version of the algorithm can be implemented such that it runs efficiently in any dimension and has no tuning parameters. We verify reversibility and prove that under weak regularity conditions geodesic slice sampling is uniformly ergodic. Numerical experiments show that the proposed slice samplers achieve excellent mixing on challenging targets including the Bingham distribution and mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions. In these settings our approach outperforms standard samplers such as random-walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Transport map unadjusted Langevin algorithms: learning and discretizing perturbed samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics are widely used in sampling high-dimensional, non-Gaussian distributions whose densities are known up to a normalizing constant. In particular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA), which directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the target distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately normalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the convergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a transport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We also show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA results in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the original dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning metrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the RMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these discretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing convergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance. Illustrative numerical results complement our theoretical claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free probability of type B was invented by Biane--Goodman--Nica, and then it was generalized by Belinschi--Shlyakhtenko and F\'evrier--Nica to infinitesimal free probability. The latter found its applications to eigenvalues of perturbed random matrices in the work of Shlyakhtenko and C\'ebron--Dahlqvist--Gabriel. This paper offers a new framework, called ``free probability of type B${}^\prime$'', which appears in the large size limit of independent unitarily invariant random matrices with perturbations. Our framework is related to boolean, free, (anti)monotone, cyclic-(anti)monotone and conditionally free independences. We then apply the new framework to the principal minor of unitarily invariant random matrices, which leads to the definition of a multivariate inverse Markov--Krein transform.</description>

      <title>Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the mathematical limits and algorithmic bounds for probabilistic group testing have become increasingly well-understood, with exact asymptotic thresholds now being known in general scaling regimes for the noiseless setting. In the noisy setting where each test outcome is flipped with constant probability, there have been similar developments, but the overall understanding has lagged significantly behind the noiseless setting. In this paper, we substantially narrow this gap by deriving exact asymptotic thresholds for the noisy setting under two widely-studied random test designs: i.i.d. Bernoulli and near-constant tests-per-item. These thresholds are established by combining components of an existing information-theoretic threshold decoder with a novel analysis of maximum-likelihood decoding (upper bounds), and deriving a novel set of impossibility results by analyzing certain failure events for optimal maximum-likelihood decoding (lower bounds).</description>

      <title>Online Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm for online differentially private synthetic data generation. For a data stream within the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ and an infinite time horizon, we develop an online algorithm that generates a differentially private synthetic dataset at each time $t$. This algorithm achieves a near-optimal accuracy bound of $O(\log(t)t^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$ and $O(\log^{4.5}(t)t^{-1})$ for $d=1$ in the 1-Wasserstein distance. This result extends the previous work on the continual release model for counting queries to Lipschitz queries. Compared to the offline case, where the entire dataset is available at once, our approach requires only an extra polylog factor in the accuracy bound.</description>

      <title>Fourier Galerkin approximation of mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to provide a finite dimensional approximation of the solution to a mean field optimal control problem set on the $d$-dimensional torus. The approximation is obtained by means of a Fourier-Galerkin method, the main principle of which is to convolve probability measures on the torus by the Dirichlet kernel or, equivalently, to truncate the Fourier expansion of probability measures on the torus. However, this operation has the main feature not to leave the space of probability measures invariant, which drawback is know as \textit{Gibbs}' phenomenon. In spite of this, we manage to prove that, for initial conditions in the `interior' of the space of probability measures and for sufficiently large levels of truncation, the Fourier-Galerkin method induces a new finite dimensional control problem whose trajectories take values in the space of probability measures with a finite number of Fourier coefficients. Our main result asserts that, whenever the cost functionals are smooth and convex, the distance between the optimal trajectories of the original and approximating control problems decreases at a polynomial rate as the index of truncation in the Fourier-Galerkin method tends to $\infty$. A similar result holds for the distance between the corresponding value functions. From a practical point of view, our approach provides an efficient strategy to approximate mean field control optimizers by finite dimensional parameters and opens new perspectives for the numerical analysis of mean field control problems. It may be also applied to discretize more general mean field game systems.</description>

      <title>On anomalous dissipation induced by transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of enstrophy and energy of solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and diffusion equations in all dimensions, respectively. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former allows us to obtain, for the first time for such type of scaling limits, convergence in a space of positive smoothness uniformly in time. Compared to known results, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Further, we discuss physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>What's the Best Seat in the Game Left, Center, Right?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Left, Center, Right is a popular dice game. We analyze the game using Markov chain and Monte Carlo methods. We compute the expected game length for two to eight players and determine the probability of winning for each player in the game. We discuss the surprising conclusions of which players have the highest and lowest chance of winning, and we propose a small rule change that makes the game a little more fair.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg (\log x)(\log\log x)^{-1/2-\epsilon}$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. In particular, we recover and extend to larger classes of dependencies an old result of Erd\H{o}s and Hunt on sign changes of partial sums of i.i.d. random variables. In the arithmetic case, the main input in our method is the ``\textit{linearity}'' phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \EE |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's \textit{better than squareroot cancellation} phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution for the stochastic tamed Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising from the biomathematics, which consists of a chemotaxis model with cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by virtue of the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators and cut-off functions, which makes it possible for constructing sufficiently smooth approximation solutions, and facilitating the effective use of stochastic entropy-energy estimates. Then, building on the entropy-energy estimates, we further derive some higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method permits us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>
