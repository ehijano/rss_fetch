      <title>Estimating parameters of continuous-time multi-chain hidden Markov models for infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to estimate the parameters of a stochastic exposed-infected epidemiological model for the transmission dynamics of notifiable infectious diseases, based on observations related to isolated cases counts only. We use the setting of hidden multi-chain Markov models and adapt the Baum-Welch algorithm to the special structure of the multi-chain. From the estimated transition matrix, we retrieve the parameters of interest (contamination rates, incubation rate, and isolation rate) from analytical expressions of the moments and Monte Carlo simulations. The performance of this approach is investigated on synthetic data, together with an analysis of the impact of using a model with one less compartment to fit the data in order to help for model selection.</description>

      <title>Spatio-seasonal risk assessment of upward lightning at tall objects using meteorological reanalysis data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates lightning at tall objects and evaluates the risk of upward lightning (UL) over the eastern Alps and its surrounding areas. While uncommon, UL poses a threat, especially to wind turbines, as the long-duration current of UL can cause significant damage. Current risk assessment methods overlook the impact of meteorological conditions, potentially underestimating UL risks. Therefore, this study employs random forests, a machine learning technique, to analyze the relationship between UL measured at Gaisberg Tower (Austria) and $35$ larger-scale meteorological variables. Of these, the larger-scale upward velocity, wind speed and direction at 10 meters and cloud physics variables contribute most information. The random forests predict the risk of UL across the study area at a 1 km$^2$ resolution. Strong near-surface winds combined with upward deflection by elevated terrain increase UL risk. The diurnal cycle of the UL risk as well as high-risk areas shift seasonally. They are concentrated north/northeast of the Alps in winter due to prevailing northerly winds, and expanding southward, impacting northern Italy in the transitional and summer months. The model performs best in winter, with the highest predicted UL risk coinciding with observed peaks in measured lightning at tall objects. The highest concentration is north of the Alps, where most wind turbines are located, leading to an increase in overall lightning activity. Comprehensive meteorological information is essential for UL risk assessment, as lightning densities are a poor indicator of lightning at tall objects.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: V. Non-asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the complexity of order statistics, the finite sample behaviour of robust statistics is generally not analytically solvable. While the Monte Carlo method can provide approximate solutions, its convergence rate is typically very slow, making the computational cost to achieve the desired accuracy unaffordable for ordinary users. In this paper, we propose an approach analogous to the Fourier transformation to decompose the finite sample structure of the uniform distribution. By obtaining sets of sequences that are consistent with parametric distributions for the first four sample moments, we can approximate the finite sample behavior of other estimators with significantly reduced computational costs. This article reveals the underlying structure of randomness and presents a novel approach to integrate multiple assumptions.</description>

      <title>Assurance Methods for designing a clinical trial with a delayed treatment effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An assurance calculation is a Bayesian alternative to a power calculation. One may be performed to aid the planning of a clinical trial, specifically setting the sample size or to support decisions about whether or not to perform a study. Immuno-oncology is a rapidly evolving area in the development of anticancer drugs. A common phenomenon that arises in trials of such drugs is one of delayed treatment effects, that is, there is a delay in the separation of the survival curves. To calculate assurance for a trial in which a delayed treatment effect is likely to be present, uncertainty about key parameters needs to be considered. If uncertainty is not considered, the number of patients recruited may not be enough to ensure we have adequate statistical power to detect a clinically relevant treatment effect and the risk of an unsuccessful trial is increased. We present a new elicitation technique for when a delayed treatment effect is likely and show how to compute assurance using these elicited prior distributions. We provide an example to illustrate how this can be used in practice and develop open-source software to implement our methods. Our methodology has the potential to improve the success rate and efficiency of Phase III trials in immuno-oncology and for other treatments where a delayed treatment effect is expected to occur.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Estimation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributed estimation and learning problems in a networked environment where agents exchange information to estimate unknown statistical properties of random variables from their privately observed samples. The agents can collectively estimate the unknown quantities by exchanging information about their private observations, but they also face privacy risks. Our novel algorithms extend the existing distributed estimation literature and enable the participating agents to estimate a complete sufficient statistic from private signals acquired offline or online over time and to preserve the privacy of their signals and network neighborhoods. This is achieved through linear aggregation schemes with adjusted randomization schemes that add noise to the exchanged estimates subject to differential privacy (DP) constraints, both in an offline and online manner. We provide convergence rate analysis and tight finite-time convergence bounds. We show that the noise that minimizes the convergence time to the best estimates is the Laplace noise, with parameters corresponding to each agent's sensitivity to their signal and network characteristics. Our algorithms are amenable to dynamic topologies and balancing privacy and accuracy trade-offs. Finally, to supplement and validate our theoretical results, we run experiments on real-world data from the US Power Grid Network and electric consumption data from German Households to estimate the average power consumption of power stations and households under all privacy regimes and show that our method outperforms existing first-order, privacy-aware, distributed optimization methods.</description>
