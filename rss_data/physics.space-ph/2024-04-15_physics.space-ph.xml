      <title>Plasma Dynamics and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in 3D Nonrelativistic Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding plasma dynamics and nonthermal particle acceleration in 3D magnetic reconnection has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore these problems by performing large-scale fully kinetic simulations of multi-xline plasmoid reconnection with various parameters in both the weak and strong guide field regimes. In each regime, we have identified its unique 3D dynamics that leads to field-line chaos and efficient acceleration, and we have achieved nonthermal acceleration of both electrons and protons into power-law spectra. The spectral indices agree well with a simple Fermi acceleration theory that includes guide field dependence. In the low-guide-field regime, the flux-rope kink instability governs the 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. The weak dependence of the spectra on the ion-to-electron mass ratio and $\beta$ ($\ll1$) implies that the particles are sufficiently magnetized for Fermi acceleration in our simulations. While both electrons and protons are injected at reconnection exhausts, protons are primarily injected by perpendicular electric fields through Fermi reflections and electrons are injected by a combination of perpendicular and parallel electric fields. The magnetic power spectra agree with in-situ magnetotail observations, and the spectral index may reflect a reconnection-driven size distribution of plasmoids instead of Goldreich-Sridhar vortex cascade. As the guide field becomes stronger, the oblique flux ropes of large sizes capture the main 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. Intriguingly, the oblique flux ropes can also run into flux-rope kink instability to drive extra 3D dynamics. This work has broad implications for 3D reconnection dynamics and particle acceleration in heliophysics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Recovery Phase of Geomagnetic Storms During Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs) are the main drivers of intense geomagnetic storms. We study the distribution of geomagnetic storms associated with different drivers during solar cycles 23 and 24 (1996-2019). Although the annual occurrence rate of geomagnetic storms in both cycles tracks the sunspot cycle, the second peak in storm activity lags the second sunspot peak. SIRs contribute significantly to the second peak in storm numbers in both cycles, particularly for moderate to stronger-than-moderate storms. We note semiannual peaks in storm numbers much closer to equinoxes for moderate storms, and slightly shifted from equinoxes for intense and stronger-than-intense storms. We note a significant fraction of multiple-peak storms in both cycles due to isolated ICMEs/SIRs, while single-peak storms from multiple interacting drivers, suggesting a complex relationship between storm steps and their drivers. Our study focuses on investigating the recovery phases of geomagnetic storms and examining their dependencies on various storm parameters. Multiple-peak storms in both cycles have recovery phase duration strongly influenced by slow and fast decay phases with no correlation with the main phase buildup rate and Dst peak. However, the recovery phase in single-peak storms for both cycles depends to some extent on the main phase buildup rate and Dst peak, in addition to slow and fast decay phases. Future research should explore recovery phases of single and multiple-peak storms incorporating in-situ solar wind observations for a deeper understanding of storm evolution and decay processes.</description>

      <title>Measuring a gravitomagentic effect with the triple pulsar PSR J0337+1715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the first post--Newtonian order, the orbital angular momentum of the fast--revolving inner binary of the triple system PSR J0337+1715, made of a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf, induces an annular gravitomagnetic field which displaces the line of apsides of the slower orbit of the other, distant white dwarf by $-1.2$ milliarcseconds per year. The current accuracy in determining the periastron of the outer orbit is $63.9$ milliarcseconds after 1.38 years of data collection. By hypothesizing a constant rate of measurement of the pulsar's times of arrivals over the next 10 years, assumed equal to the present one, it can be argued that the periastron will be finally known to a $\simeq 0.15$ milliarcseconds level, while its cumulative gravitomagnetic retrograde shift will be as large as $-12$ milliarcseconds. The competing post--Newtonian gravitolectric periastron advance due to the inner binary's masses, nominally amounting to $74.3$ milliarcseconds per year, can be presently modelled to an accuracy level as good as $\simeq 0.04$ milliarcseconds per year. The mismodelling in the much larger Newtonian periastron rate due to the quadrupolar term of the multipolar expansion of the gravitational potential of a massive ring, whose nominal size for PSR J0337+1715 is $0.17$ degrees per year, might be reduced down to the $\simeq 0.5$ milliarcseconds per year level over the next 10 years. Thus, a first measurement of such a novel form of gravitomagnetism, although challenging, may be somehow feasible in a not too distant future.</description>

      <title>Origin and Properties of the Near Subsonic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., $M_S \sim 1$) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The near subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast wind. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near subsonic wind as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL), which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15-20 $R_S$. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called "torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common cause. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10%, the "Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability prominent in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>
