      <title>Linear resolution of connected graph ideals and their powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite simple graph $G$ and an integer $r \ge 1$, the $r$-connected ideal $I_r(G)$ is the squarefree monomial ideal generated by the vertex sets of connected induced subgraphs of size $r+1$, extending the classical edge ideal. We investigate the linearity of the minimal free resolutions of $I_r(G)$ via structural features of the associated clutter $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$. We introduce the class of co-chordal-cactus graphs and prove that $I_r(G)$ has a linear resolution for all $r \ge 2$ whenever $G$ lies in this family. The result further extends to $(2K_2, C_4)$-free graphs and co-grid graphs. For $r=1$, we show that the edge ideal $I_1(G)$ has Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity at most $3$ for all co-chordal-cactus and co-grid graphs. We also examine powers of connected ideals and establish that $I_r(G)^q$ has a linear resolution for every $q \ge 1$ in several natural graph families, including complements of trees with bounded degree, complete multipartite graphs, complements of cycles, graphs obtained by gluing complete graphs along cliques, and certain subclasses of split graphs.</description>

      <title>On Christophersen's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional (Artinian) Gorenstein algebra, and let $\operatorname{Aut}(A)^{\circ}$ denote the connected component of the identity in the automorphism group of $A$. We introduce a new subclass of Gorenstein algebras and prove that for any algebra $A$ in this subclass, the group $\operatorname{Aut}(A)^{\circ}$ is solvable. This result is closely related to the Christophersen problem in the theory of local algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Teter rings via the canonical trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Puthenpurakal's higher-dimensional Teter rings via the canonical trace ideal. We give a sufficient criterion for Teterness and show that, in the standard graded case, it is also necessary, yielding a characterization. Consequently, several nearly Gorenstein families are Teter; moreover, under certain hypotheses, the Cohen--Macaulay type of nearly Gorenstein rings is bounded by the codimension. We also analyze Teterness for fiber products, Veronese subrings, and numerical semigroup rings.</description>

      <title>Top dickson class and annihilators of cohomology over invariant rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote the finite field with $q = p^r$ elements. Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and let $G \subseteq GL(V)$ be a group. Let $R = \mathbb{F}_q[V] = \text{Sym}(V^*)$ and let $S = R^G$.
  Let $\mathbf{d}_{d,0} $ be the top Dickson class, i.e., $\mathbf{d}_{d,0} = \prod_{0\neq v \in V^*}v$. Surprisingly (a power of) $\mathbf{d}_{d,0}$ annihilates many cohomological modules.
  (a) Let $H^i(G, R)$ be the $i^{th}$-group cohomology of $R$ considered as a $S$-module. Set $J_i = \text{ann}_S \ H^i(G, R)$. We show that $\mathbf{d}_{d,0} \in \sqrt{J_i}$ for all $i \geq 1$.
  (b) We also show that $\mathbf{d}_{d,0} \in \sqrt{ \text{ann}_S \ H^j_{S_+}(S)}$ for all $ 0 \leq j \leq d - 1$ (here $H^j_{S_+}(S)$ is the $j^{th}$ local cohomology of $S$ with respect to $S_+$).
  As an application we get that there exists a fixed power of $\mathbf{d}_{d,0} $ which works as a cohomological annihilator.</description>

      <title>The local homological structure of generalized splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized splines are a simultaneous generalization of GKM theory -- which studies equivariant cohomology -- and classical splines, which provide piecewise approximations of functions. Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.
  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free.</description>

      <title>A Kunz-type theorem for formal unramification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a morphism of schemes of positive characteristic whose relative Frobenius is a morphism of locally noetherian schemes, being formally unramified (resp. formally \'etale) is equivalent to its Frobenius morphism being a closed immersion (resp. an isomorphism). We also discuss the non-noetherian case.</description>

      <title>On certain definable coarsenings of valuation rings and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how suitable extensions $(L|K,v)$ of prime degree of valued fields give rise to definable coarsenings of the valuation rings of $L$ and $K$. In the case of Artin-Schreier and Kummer extensions with wild ramification, we can also define the ramification ideal. We demonstrate the use of the coarsenings on $L$, their maximal ideals, and the ramification ideals for the classification of defects and for the presentation of the K\"ahler differentials of the extension of the valuation rings of $(L|K,v)$, and their annihilators. Finally, we give a construction that realizes predescribed convex subgroups of suitable value groups as those that are associated with Galois extensions of degree $p$ with independent defect, which in turn give rise to definable coarsenings.</description>

      <title>Decomposing conditional independence ideals with hidden variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of determinantal ideals whose decompositions encode the structural zeros in conditional independence models with hidden variables. We provide explicit decompositions of these ideals and, for certain subclasses of models, we show that this is a decomposition into radical ideals by displaying Gr\"obner bases for the components. We identify conditions under which the components are prime, and establish formulas for the dimensions of these prime ideals.
  Moreover, we show that the components in the decomposition can be grouped into equivalence classes defined by their combinatorial structure, and we derive a closed formula for the number of such classes.</description>

      <title>Invariants for isomorphism classes in the category $\bcalNT$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The category $\bcalNT$ is a category of certain commutative graded algebras over a field. It was introduced in \cite{Lobos2} as a generalization of algebras generated by Jucys-Murphy elements in the many \textbf{End} algebras of the diagrammatic Soergel category of Elias and Williamson. In the first part of this article we define certain \emph{Invariants} for the isomorphism classes in $\bcalNT,$ following in the same spirit of \cite{Lobos3}, where a series of \emph{Isomorphism criteria} were found. At the end, we use our invariants to provide a new lower bound for the number of isomorphism classes, improving a similar result obtained in \cite{Lobos3}.</description>

      <title>Algebraic study on rooted products of graphs and multi-clique corona graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rooted products of graphs from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. For edge ideals, we introduce the 2-Cohen-Macaulayness with respect to a vertex and use it to investigate when edge ideals of rooted products of graphs are Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we completely determine when attaching a graph on at most six vertices to a given graph as rooted products, yields a Cohen-Macaulay edge ideal. Also, we define mulit-clique corona graphs as a generalization of clique-corona graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique corona graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. Also, we give formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $t$-connected ideal of a graph $G$ is generated by all connected induced subgraphs of $G$ with $t$ vertices. When $t = 2$, this coincides with the usual edge ideal of the graph. Following the work of Faridi et al., we give a classification of the graphs whose $t$-connected ideals are minimally resolved by their Scarf complex. We also consider the $t$-path ideal of a graph $G$ which is the ideal generated by all paths of length $t$ in $G$. In this case, we are able to give a classification of the same type for paths of length $t = 4$.</description>

      <title>Witt Groups and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence for Stabilizer States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.</description>
