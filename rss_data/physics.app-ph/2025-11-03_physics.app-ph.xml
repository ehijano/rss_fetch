      <title>Electromagnetic Investigation of Crosstalk in Bent Microstrip Lines with Partial and Apertured Shielding: Simulations and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.</description>

      <title>Development of organic passive devices for RF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A huge interesting progress in the field of organic electronic materials and devices has been observed in the last decade. However, the understanding of these materials is still a challenge to overcome. Most studies in literature focus on active devices such as OTFTs, OLEDs and OPVs. Nevertheless, a complete technology has to have also passive devices in order to allow the design of interesting applications and complex circuits. This paper deals with the development of a complete set of passive devices allowing the fabrication of simple applications such as filters or sensors. The process flow is a fully screen printed technology that uses exclusively organic materials on gold laser ablated flexible substrate. Discrete passive (R, L, C) devices have been processed and characterized. This has permitted the fabrication of RLC low-band pass filters that are dedicated to RF applications, typically around 1GHz. Furthermore, based on these discrete passive components, we have developed a sensitive sensor on flexible substrate for RFID applications. We present the state of the art of our process development for RF applications using organic materials.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Theory of Photocurrent in Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The built-in potential of p-n junctions plays a critical role in charge separation, which is fundamental to the photovoltaic effect. However, the conventional classical theory of photovoltaic effect in p-n junctions typically does not account for the quantitative influence of the built-in potential. In this study, we revisit the classical theory and propose an improved analytic expression of photocurrent by applying more accurate boundary conditions. Our improved expression reveals that the photocurrent comprises of two components: the conventional photocurrent and a previously unrecognized backward photocurrent. Latter reduces the total photocurrent, yet it has not been discussed in prior literature. The essential role of the built-in potential is to suppress this backward current. Furthermore, our improved expression of photocurrent predicts that the photocurrent vanishes under certain forward bias conditions. This prediction is experimentally validated using a commercial silicon solar cell, confirming the direct impact of the built-in potential on photocurrent behavior.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High Dose-Rates, the FLASH Effect, and Hydrogen Peroxide Yields: Do Experiments and Simulations Really Disagree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation chemistry of model systems irradiated with ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR) is key to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the sparing of healthy tissue, which is called the FLASH effect. It is envisioned to be used for efficient treatment of cancer by FLASH radiotherapy. However, it seems that even the most simple model systems, water irradiated with varying dose-rates (DR), pose a challenge. This became evident, as differences within measured and predicted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) for exposure of liquid samples to conventional DR and UHDR were reported. Many of the recently reported values contradict older experiments and current Monte-Carlo simulations(MCS). In the present work, we aim to identify possible reasons of these discrepancies and propose ways to overcome this issue. Hereby a short review of recent and classical literature concerning experimental and simulational studies is performed. The studies cover different radiation sources, from gamma rays, high-energy electrons, heavy particles (protons and ions) with low and high linear energy transfer (LET), and samples of hypoxic &amp; oxygenated water, with cosolutes such as bovine-serum albumine (BSA). Results are for additional experimental parameters, such as solvent, sample container and analysis methods used to determine the respective g-values of H2O2. Similarly the parameter of the MCS by the step-by-step approach, or the independent-reaction time (IRT) method are discussed. Here, UHDR induced modification of the radical-radical interaction and dynamics, not governed by diffusion processes, may cause problems. Approaches to test these different models are highlighted to allow progress: by making the step from a purely descriptive discourse of the effects observed, towards testable models, which should clarify the reasons of how and why such a disagreement came to light in the first place.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Switching Dynamics in HZO-based FeMEMS Synapses for Neuromorphic Weight Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing demands synaptic elements that can store and update weights with high precision while being read non-destructively. Conventional ferroelectric synapses store weights in remnant polarization states and might require destructive electrical readout, limiting endurance and reliability. We demonstrate a ferroelectric MEMS (FeMEMS) based synapse in which analog weights are stored in the piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31,eff}$ of a released Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) MEMS unimorph. Partial switching of ferroelectric domains modulates $d_{31,eff}$, and a low-amplitude mechanical drive reads out the weight without read-disturb in the device yielding more than 7-bit of programming levels. The mechanical switching distribution function follows a Lorentzian distribution as a logarithmic function of partial poling voltage ($V_p$) consistent with nucleation-limited switching (NLS), and the median threshold extracted from electromechanical data obeys a Merz-type field-time law with a dimensionless exponent $\alpha = 3.62$. These relationships establish a quantitative link between mechanical weights and electrical switching kinetics. This mechanically read synapse avoids depolarization and charge-injection effects, provides bipolar weights (well suited for excitatory and inhibitory synapses), directly reveals partial domain populations, and offers a robust, energy-efficient route toward high-bit neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Towards intense single-digit attosecond pulses with a 100-mJ-class mid-infrared sub-cycle laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The duration of isolated attosecond pulses created via high-order harmonic generation is determined by the number of optical cycles in the driving laser. Achieving shorter attosecond soft X-ray pulses requires minimizing the number of cycles while maintaining a high pulse energy. Here, we demonstrate a carrier-envelope-phase-stable, 100-mJ-class sub-cycle mid-infrared laser that produces a supercontinuum coherent soft X-ray with unprecedented bandwidth. The system delivers 50-mJ, 6.7-fs (0.88-cycle) pulses at a center wavelength of 2.26 $\mu$m - over two orders of magnitude more energetic than any previous sub-cycle laser. We applied the system to high-order harmonic generation and compared the results to simulations based on the three-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify unique features of sub-cycle lasers. This work represents a decisive step toward high-energy half-cycle lasers and high-energy single-digit attosecond soft X-ray pulses that can be used to probe matter and light-matter interactions at previously inaccessible temporal resolutions.</description>

      <title>Spatial organization of biomass controls intrinsic permeability of porous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofilms in porous media critically influence hydraulic properties in environmental and engineered systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how microbial life controls permeability remains elusive. By combining microfluidics, controlled pressure gradient and time-lapse microscopy, we quantify how motile and non-motile bacteria colonize a porous landscape and alter its resistance to flow. We find that while both strains achieve nearly identical total biomass, they cause drastically different permeability reductions - 78% for motile cells versus 94% for non-motile cells. This divergence stems from motility, which limits biomass spatial accumulation, whereas non-motile cells clog the entire system. We develop a mechanistic model that accurately predicts permeability dynamics from the pore-scale biomass distribution. We conclude that the spatial organization of biomass, not its total amount, is the primary factor controlling permeability.</description>

      <title>Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered, as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and storage technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a high-performance thermochromic VO2-based coating prepared by using a three-step process, consisting of magnetron sputter depositions of SiO2 films and V-W films and their postannealing, on standard glass at a low substrate temperature of 350 {\deg}C without opening the vacuum chamber to atmosphere. It is formed by four layers of W-doped VO2 nanoparticles dispersed in SiO2 matrix. The coating exhibits a transition temperature of 33 {\deg}C with an integral luminous transmittance of 65.4% (low-temperature state) and 60.1% (high-temperature state), and a modulation of the solar energy transmittance of 15.3%. Such a combination of properties, together with the low temperature during preparation, fulfill the requirements for large-scale implementation on building glass and have not been reported yet.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Grating Couplers with Tunable Wavelength via Scaling and Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are heavily researched devices for telecommunication, biosensing, and quantum technologies. Wafer-scale fabrication and testing are crucial for reducing costs and enabling large-scale deployment. Grating couplers allow non-invasive measurements before packaging, but classical designs rely on long tapers and narrow bandwidths. In this work, we present compact, inverse-designed grating couplers with broadband transmission. We optimized and fabricated arrays of devices and characterized them with a 4f-scanning setup. The nominal design reached simulated efficiencies of 52 %, while measurements confirmed robust performance with up to 32 % efficiency at the target 1540 nm wavelength and 46 % at shifted wavelengths. Without scaling and contour biasing, the measured efficiency at the target wavelength drops to only 4.4 %. Thus, a key finding is that systematic scaling and edge biasing recover up to an eightfold improvement in efficiency. These inverse-designed grating couplers can be efficiently corrected post-design, enabling reliable performance despite fabrication deviations. This approach allows simple layout adjustments to compensate for process-induced variations, supporting wafer-scale testing, cryogenic photonic applications, and rapid design wavelength tuning.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the behaviour of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in the presence of a foam. Such a problem may be relevant, for example, to some inertial confinement fusion (ICF) scenarios such as foams within the capsule or lining the inner hohlraum wall. The foam displays 3 different phases: by order of increasing stress, it is first elastic, then plastic, and then fractures. Only the elastic and plastic phases can be subject to a linear analysis of the instability. The growth rate is analytically computed in these 2 phases, in terms of the micro-structure of the foam. In the first, elastic, phase, the RTI can be stabilized for some wavelengths. In this elastic phase, a homogenous foam model overestimates the growth because it ignores the elastic nature of the foam. Although this result is derived for a simplified foam model, it is likely valid for most of them. Besides the ICF context considered here, our results could be relevant for many fields of science.</description>

      <title>An 11.7-GHz ScAlN FBAR Filter: Case Study on Scaling Limits and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports an 11.7 GHz compact 50 ohm ladder filter based on single layer Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) with platinum (Pt) electrodes, and uses it as a quantitative case study of the limits encountered when directly scaling to higher frequencies. The measured filter achieves a 3 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than 23.1 dB, with a minimum insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB. We analyze the origin of this performance through a quantitative framework: (1) a loss decomposition study, (2) frequency shift sensitivity that explains the discrepancy between simulated and measured center frequency, (3) FBW sensitivity to series shunt separation and port impedance, and (4) stress limited aperture that constrains device size. The results establish a realistic, fabricable baseline for directly scaled single layer ScAlN FBAR filters and outline materials, electrode, and stress management directions toward lower loss mmWave acoustic filters.</description>

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; however, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be rigorously explored. This letter introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to learn the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>
