      <title>Efficient Framework for Solving Plasma Waves with Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma, which constitutes 99\% of the visible matter in the universe, is characterized by a wide range of waves and instabilities that play a pivotal role in space physics, astrophysics, laser-plasma interactions, fusion research, and laboratory experiments. The linear physics of these phenomena is described by kinetic dispersion relations (KDR). However, solving KDRs for arbitrary velocity distributions remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Maxwellian distributions frequently observed in various plasma environments. This work introduces a novel, efficient, and unified numerical framework to address this challenge. The proposed method rapidly and accurately yields all significant solutions of KDRs for nearly arbitrary velocity distributions, supporting both unstable and damped modes across all frequencies and wavevectors. The approach expands plasma species' velocity distribution functions using a series of carefully chosen orthogonal basis functions and employs a highly accurate rational approximation to transform the problem into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem, eliminating the need for initial guesses. The efficiency and versatility of this framework are demonstrated, enabling simplified studies of plasma waves with arbitrary distributions. This advancement paves the way for uncovering new physics in natural plasma environments, such as spacecraft observations in space plasmas, and applications like wave heating in fusion research.</description>

      <title>Detecting Linear Breit-Wheeler Signals with a Laser-Foil Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental QED process, linear Breit-Wheeler (LBW) pair production predicted 90 years ago has not yet been demonstrated in experiments with real photons. Here, we propose an experimentally advantageous scheme to detect the LBW signal by irradiating a foil target with a single 10 PW-level laser. Our integrated QED particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that the LBW signal can be explicitly distinguished from the Bethe-Heitler (BH) signal by comparing positron energy spectra behind the target at varying target thicknesses. The LBW positrons are created at the front of the target and subsequently experience both laser vacuum acceleration and sheath field acceleration to gain high energies, while BH positrons, originating within the target bulk, are only subjected to sheath field acceleration. As a result, the invariance of the high-energy tail of positron spectra with respect to the target thickness serves as a distinct signature of the LBW process. Notably, this scheme remains viable even when the BH yield dominates over the LBW yield.</description>

      <title>Conefield approach to identifying regions without flux surfaces for magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conefield variant of a Converse KAM method for 3D vector fields, identifying regions through which no invariant 2-tori pass transverse to a specified direction field, is tested on some helical perturbations of an axisymmetric magnetic field in toroidal geometry. This implementation computes bounds on the slopes of invariant tori of a given class and allows to apply a subsidiary criterion for the extension of the non-existence region, saving significant computation time. The method finds regions corresponding to magnetic islands and chaos for the fieldline flow.</description>

      <title>Interaction of upper hybrid waves with dust-ion-magnetoacoustic waves and stable two-dimensional solitons in dusty plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a two-dimensional nonlinear system of equations for the electrostatic potential envelope and the low-frequency magnetic field perturbation to describe the interaction of the upper hybrid wave propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic field with the dust-ion-magnetoacoustic (DIMA) wave in a magnetized dusty plasma. The equations contain both scalar and vector nonlinearities. A nonlinear dispersion relation is derived and the decay and modulation instability thresholds and growth rates are obtained. Numerical estimates show that instability thresholds can easily be exceeded in real dusty plasmas. In the static (subsonic) approximation, a two-dimensional (2D) soliton solution (ground state) is found numerically by the generalized Petviashvili relaxation method. The perturbations of the magnetic field and plasma density in the soliton are nonmonotonic in space and, along with the perturbation in the form of a well, there are also perturbation humps. Such peculiar radial soliton profiles differ significantly from previously known results on 2D solitons. The key point is that the presence of a gap in the DIMA wave dispersion due to the Rao cutoff frequency causes the nonlinearity to be nonlocal. We show that due to nonlocal nonlinearity the Hamiltonian is bounded below at fixed energy, proving the stability of the ground state.</description>

      <title>Particle-In-Cell Simulations of Quantum Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room-temperature metals and semi-metals which consist of a gas of bound electrons in a near-continuum band structure can be classified as cold quantum plasmas. This insight suggests that Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, traditionally used for modeling classical plasmas, may be adapted for the next generation of nanoscopic simulations in photonics, plasmonics, and beyond. This article introduces four key physics modules implemented in two open-source PIC codes that can be applied to condensed matter calculations. These modules include (I) the incorporation of Fermi-Dirac (FD) electrons, (II) material structure boundary conditions, (III) a bound particle model for linear dispersive materials, and (IV) the inclusion of massless Dirac carriers for simulating graphene-like materials. By integrating these modules into existing PIC frameworks, we provide a versatile and self-consistent approach for simulating condensed matter systems, opening new avenues for modeling dynamic phenomena in photonics and plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A faster than real time forecast system for solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field transients that is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms is proposed to provide a continuous nowcast of the solar corona ($&lt;0.1$AU) and 24-hours forecast of the solar wind at 1 AU by solving a full 3-D MHD model. This new model has been inspired by the concept of \textit{relativity of simultaneity} used in the theory of special relativity. It is based on time transformation between two coordinate systems: the solar rest frame and a boosted system in which the current observations of the solar magnetic field and tomorrow's measurement of the solar wind at 1 AU are simultaneous. In this paper we derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics (HD) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and present a new numerical algorithm that only modifies the conserved quantities but preserves the original HD/MHD numerical flux. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation, and thus a significantly longer forecast time than the traditional method.</description>

      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition From Turbulence To Zonal Flows In The Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition between two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence and quasi-one-dimensional zonostrophic turbulence is examined in the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system, which is considered as a minimal model of $\beta$-plane-like drift-wave turbulence with an intrinsic instability. Extensive parameter scans were performed across a wide range of values for the adiabaticity parameter $C$ describing the strength of coupling between the two equations. A sharp transition from 2D isotropic turbulence to a quasi-1D system, dominated by zonal flows, is observed using the fraction of the kinetic energy of the zonal modes as the order parameter, at $C\approx0.1$. It is shown that this transition exhibits a hysteresis loop around the transition point, where the adiabaticity parameter plays the role of the control parameter of its non-linear self-organisation. It was also observed that the radial particle flux scales with the adiabaticity parameter following two different power law dependencies in the two regimes. A simple quasi-linear saturation rule which accounts for the presence of zonal flows is proposed, and is shown to agree very well with the observed nonlinear fluxes. Motivated by the phenomenon of quasi-one dimensionalisation of the system at high $C$, a number of reduction schemes based on a limited number of modes were investigated and the results were compared to direct numerical simulations. In particular, it was observed that a minimal reduced model consisting of $2$ poloidal and $2$ radial modes was able to replicate the phase transition behaviour, while any further reduction failed to capture it.</description>

      <title>Relation between particle beam eigen-emittances and canonical vorticity flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.01218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle beams provided by accelerators occupy a finite volume of the four dimensional transverse phase space. The latter is spanned by the four degrees of freedom, i.e., horizontal/vertical position and momentum. This volume is referred to as emittance. Horizontal and vertical emittances are obtained through projections onto the two transverse sub-phase spaces. Eigen-emittances are obtained from the latter by removing all horizontal-vertical correlations through an appropriate beam optics section. Canonical vorticity flux is used for instance for modelling dynamics of tubes formed by magnetic field lines and particle currents embedded into plasmas. This report is on the relation of eigen-emittances and canonical vorticity flux. Change of beam eigen-emittances is equivalent to change of beam canonical vorticity flux.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>
