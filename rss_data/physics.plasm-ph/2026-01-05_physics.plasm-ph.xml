      <title>Generation and characterization of coherent terahertz radiation from 100-TW laser-wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally characterized terahertz (THz) radiation emitted from laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) driven at 100-TW laser power. Simultaneous measurements of the laser energy, electron-bunch charge, and THz energy reveal a quadratic dependence of the THz energy on both charge and laser energy. This behavior indicates coherent collective emission in the generation process and provides a useful scaling law for THz output. Microbolometer-based beam profiling shows a relatively large THz beam divergence (~0.2 rad). Single-shot THz interferometry further shows that the emitted THz pulse is sub-picosecond in duration and broadband. Combining the beam-profile and interferometric measurements, the THz spectrum is expected to span approximately 1-20 THz. Together, these results support coherent acceleration radiation as the dominant mechanism for THz generation in 100-TW LWFA.</description>

      <title>Transient spark dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode for dye degradation: A primary study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential application of non-thermal plasma in treating textile industrial wastewater motivates researchers to develop innovative techniques at a laboratory scale to achieve the goal of wastewater mineralization. In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples). The results suggest that the proposed dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor may offer a promising solution for treating dye effluents from the textile industry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced wakefield generation in homogeneous plasma via two co-propagating laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation deals with enhanced plasma wakefield amplitude generated using two co-propagating laser pulses in homogeneous plasma. The configuration consists of a seed pulse followed by a trailing pulse, both linearly polarized and sharing identical laser parameters. The enhancement in wakefield amplitude corresponding to fixed spatial separation is optimized for various pulse widths and intensities of the seed and trailing lasers. Analytical modelling and particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the maximum amplification in wakefield amplitude is obtained when spatial separation equals the plasma wavelength (\lambda_p). The spatial intervals between laser pulses critically influence the wakefield amplification. These findings confirm that the two co-propagating lasers scheme provides a promising route toward stronger plasma wakefield excitation, potentially important for various applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cathode Boundary and Initial Electron Swarm Width on Electron Swarm Parameter Determination with the Pulsed Townsend Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pulsed Townsend experiment enables the extraction of relevant electron transport properties in different gases such as the electron drift velocity $W$ (or equivalently the mobility $\mu$), the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$, and the effective ionization rate $R_{\mathrm{net}}$ (or equivalently the effective ionization coefficient $\alpha$). Existing analysis techniques lack an accurate representation of the experimental initial and boundary conditions. This work aims to provide an improved evaluation approach by appropriately considering both initial and boundary conditions in order to extract more accurate swarm parameters from measurement data. Simulative and experimental measurement results verify an increased evaluation accuracy. Furthermore, the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$ can now be accurately extracted from Pulsed Townsend measurements. The developed curve fitting code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Update on the design of the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the final configuration chosen to be build for the Columbia Stellarator eXperiment (CSX), a new stellartor experiment at Columbia University. In a recent publication, Baillod et al. (NF, 2025) discussed in detail the different objectives, constraints, and optimization algorithms used to find an optimal configuration for CSX. In this paper, we build upon this first publication and find a configuration that satisfies all the constraints. We describe this final configuration including discussion of the coil finite build effects, sensitivity analyses, and the plasma neoclassical physics properties using the SFINCS code. These post-processing calculations provide a confirmation that the experimental goals of CSX can be achieved with the presented configuration.</description>

      <title>Stimulation of surface ionization waves by pulsed laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of semiconducting material within a composite barrier enables the perfectly uniform propagation of surface ionization waves (SIW) in air at atmospheric pressure regardless of the polarity of the applied electric field, unlike surface discharges generated using purely dielectric barriers. We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $\mu$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $\mu$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability in partially ionized plasmas: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new two-fluid model for a partially ionized magnetoplasma under gravity, where electrons and neutrals are treated as a single fluid, and singly charged positive ions are a separate fluid. We observe that the classical result of gravitational instability (also known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability) in fully ionized plasmas is significantly modified by the influence of ion-neutral collisions (with frequency $\nu_{\rm{in}}$) and transverse wave numbers ($k_x$ and $k_y$). The instability growth rate can be enhanced or decreased depending on the values of the ratios $\kappa\equiv k_x/k_y$ and $f\equiv\nu_{\rm{in}}/\Omega_{\rm{ci}}$, where $\Omega_{\rm{ci}}$ is the ion-cyclotron frequency. We also estimate the growth rates relevant to the ionospheric E-region and solar atmosphere, noting that such growth rates can be maximized for $\kappa,~f\ll1$, or for $\kappa&gt;1$ and $f\sim0.64$, and minimized for $f\gg1$ irrespective of the value of $\kappa$. Furthermore, the timescale of instability ranges from $1$ minute to $2$ minutes in the solar atmosphere, while in the E region, it ranges from $1$ minute to $80$ minutes. The latter can be a satisfactory result for the reported lifetime of solar prominence threads.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>

      <title>Revisiting p-$^{11}$B Fusion: Updated Cross-sections, Reactivity, and Energy Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress has substantially improved the available cross-section data for the p-$^{11}$B fusion reaction, particularly in energy regions that previously lacked direct measurements. In this study, we develop a high-precision analytical parameterization of the p-$^{11}$B reaction cross-section over the 0--10 MeV energy range, incorporating the new experimental data into a continuous and numerically efficient representation. Using this parameterization, we evaluate the thermonuclear reactivity of the p-$^{11}$B reaction and examine the effects of the dominant resonance at 0.6 MeV and a newly observed resonance around 4.7 MeV. Furthermore, we assess the energy balance by analyzing the fusion power density and the electron bremsstrahlung power density. Our results indicate that p-$^{11}$B fusion is not precluded by bremsstrahlung constraints when contemporary cross-section data and self-consistent thermal modeling are employed.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Absorption of Sound Waves via the Bulk Viscosity in the Partially Ionized Solar Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity and thermodynamic variables of a hydrogen-helium cocktail: internal energy, enthalpy, pressure, their derivatives, heat capacities per constant density and pressure are obtained using temperature and density height profiles of the solar atmosphere [Avrett &amp; Loeser, ApJS Vol. 175, 229 (2008)]. The qualitative evaluation for the necessary sound wave energy flux to heat the solar chromosphere is determined to be 320 kW/m$^2$. It is concluded that the bulk viscosity creates the dominating mechanism of acoustic waves damping and it is not necessary to introduce artificial viscosity or to conclude that shear viscosity is not sufficient for chromosphere heating; the volume viscosity induced wave absorption is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Mass-loaded magnetic explosions in the context of Magnetar Giant Flares and Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events where intense high-energy emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.</description>

      <title>High-energy Emission from Turbulent Electron-ion Coronae of Accreting Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model of particle energization and emission from strongly turbulent black-hole coronae. Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Electronic-Entropy-Driven Solid-Solid Phase Transitions in Elemental Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermodynamic phase diagram of seventeen elemental metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp), face-centered cubic (fcc), and body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures using finite-temperature density functional theory. Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation.</description>

      <title>Factors Controlling the Statistics of Magnetic Reconnection in MHD Turbulence</title>

Abstract: We study the statistics of dynamical quantities associated with magnetic reconnection events embedded in a sea of strong background magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using direct numerical simulations. We focus on the relationship of the reconnection properties to the statistics of global turbulent fields. For the first time, we show that the distribution in turbulence of reconnection rates (determined by upstream fields) is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the global turbulent magnetic field at the correlation scale. The average reconnection rates, and associated dissipation rates, during turbulence are thus much larger than predicted by using turbulent magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes at the dissipation or kinetic scales. Magnetic reconnection may therefore be playing a major role in energy dissipation in astrophysical and heliospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>
