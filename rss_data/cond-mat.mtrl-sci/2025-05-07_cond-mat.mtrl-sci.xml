      <title>Electronic structure and exchange interactions in altermagnetic MnGeP$_2$ in the quasiparticle-self-consistent $GW$ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QS$GW$ method is used to study the electronic band structure, optical dielectric function, and exchange interactions in chalcopyrite, $I\bar{4}2d$, structure MnGeP$_2$. The material is found to be an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with lowest direct gap of 2.44 eV at the $\Gamma$ point and an indirect gap of 2.16 eV. The spin splittings along a low symmetry line like $PN$ are sizable, while at {\bf k}-points on the diagonal mirror planes or on the twofold symmetry axes the spin splitting is zero. The exchange interactions are calculated using a linear response approach. The antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction between nearest neighbors in the primitive unit cell is dominating and found to be slightly decreasing upon carrier doping. The transverse spin susceptibilities, which provide interatomic site exchange interactions after averaging over the muffin-tin spheres, are calculated from the $GW$ band structure and wave functions. From these exchange interactions, the spin wave spectra are obtained along the high symmetry lines and the N\'{e}el temperature is calculated using the mean-field, and Tyablikov estimations. The dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are calculated including excitonic effects using the Bethe Salpeter equation. The exchange interactions around Mn$_{\rm Ge}$ defect sites is also studied. While we find it can generate ferromagnetic interactions with neighboring spins, we did not find evidence of producing an overall ferromagnetic phase. If Mn antisites are introduced by exchanging Mn with a nearby Ge, the interactions stay largely antiferromagnetic. Adding Mn antisites leads to a metallic band structure.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced Spin Reorientation in Kagome Magnet TmMn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome-lattice compounds RMn6Sn6 (R is a rare earth element), where the Mn atoms form a kagome net in the basal plane, are currently attracting a great deal of attention as they have been shown to host complex magnetic textures and electronic topological states strongly sensitive to the choice of the R atom. Among the magnetic R atoms, TmMn6Sn6 orders with the easy-plane magnetization forming a complex magnetic spiral along the c-axis. Previous neutron studies, carried on polycrystalline, samples found that Ga doping changes the magnetic anisotropy from easy-plane to easy-axis. Here we present magnetic and magnetotransport measurements on a single crystal and first principles calculations in the doping series of TmMn6Sn6-xGax. We find that the magnetic properties are highly sensitive even to a small concentration of Ga. With minimal Ga substitution, the easy-plane anisotropy is maintained, which gradually changes to the easy-axis anisotropy with increasing Ga. We discuss these observations with respect to the effect of Ga doping on magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Tm crystal field</description>

      <title>Atom-by-atom Imaging of Moir\'e Phasons using Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted 2D materials exhibit unique vibrational modes called moir\'e phonons, which arise from the moir\'e superlattice. Here, we demonstrate atom-by-atom imaging of phasons, an ultrasoft class of moir\'e phonons in twisted bilayer WSe2. Using ultrahigh-resolution (&lt;15 pm) electron ptychography, we image the size and shape of each atom to extract time-averaged vibrational amplitudes as a function of twist angle and position. We observe several signature properties of moir\'e phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions. By correlating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show phasons dominate the thermal vibrations in low-angle twisted bilayers. These results represent a powerful route to image thermal vibrations at atomic resolution, unlocking experimental studies of a thus-far hidden branch of moir\'e phonon physics.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of the prototypical perovskite CaTiO$_3$ from second-principles effective interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a second-principles effective interatomic potential for the perovskite $\rm CaTiO_3$ (CTO), relying on a Taylor polynomial expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer energy surface around the cubic reference structure, in terms of atomic displacements and macroscopic strains. This model captures various phases of CTO, in particular successfully reproducing the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. The finite-temperature simulations suggest that the sequence of structural phase transitions over heating of CTO is: $Pbnm \ (a^-a^-c^+) \rightarrow C2/m \ (a^-b^-c^0) \rightarrow I4/mcm \ (a^-c^0c^0) \rightarrow Pm\bar{3}m \ (a^0a^0a^0)$, during which the oxygen octahedral rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish progressively. The model also provides the opportunity of investigating the properties of the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase, which is a metastable phase free of lattice instability at zero Kelvin. Our model-based simulations confirm that the $R3c$ phase remains stable below a certain finite temperature. Additionally, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations. A similar mechanism is also observed in the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state in our simulation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of atomic correlated disordering in photoinduced VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest that atomic disordering dynamics are more universal than conventional coherent processes in photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs), yet its mechanism remains unclear. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we find that, at lower photoexcitation, higher lattice temperature accelerates atomic disordering, which thereby lowers the threshold for phase transition, by thermally exciting more phonons to randomize the lattice vibrations in VO$_2$. Above this threshold, however, we observe that the transition timescale and atomic disordering become temperature-independent since thermally excited lattice vibrations induce a similar evolution of photoexcited holes. Additionally, we show that photoexcitation initially elongates the V-V dimers followed by a rotation with tangential displacements (along the z-axis) mediated by O atoms, resulting in strongly correlated motion along the z-axis. Consequently, atomic disordering is more dominant along the x direction, attributed to the relatively unrestricted motion of V-V dimers along this direction. The motion of V atoms along the z-axis is more constrained, leading to less disorder along the z-axis, which results in a "correlated disorder" phenomenon. This anisotropic disordering in VO$_2$ offers new insights into PIPTs mechanisms, guiding future studies on photoinduced disordered transitions.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Interface-Driven Spin-Orbit Coupling in Molecular Adsorbates on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts molecular orbital degeneracy, enabling bi-level electronic platforms suitable for next-generation digital devices. However, common light-atom molecular feedstocks exhibit weak SOC due to the absence of heavy elements. To enhance SOC without synthesizing new materials, we leverage interfacial interactions between molecules and transition-element-based solid-state materials. This computational study investigates SOC splitting in metal-phthalocyanine adsorbed on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using density functional theory (DFT). The enhanced SOC splitting is attributed to strong orbital hybridization at the molecule-substrate interface. Specifically, Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPC) on monolayer MoS2 achieves a notable SOC splitting of ~8 meV. Furthermore, when ZnPC forms self-assembled chains on MoS2, the splitting increases to ~20 meV, driven by the formation of hybrid bands modulated by molecular periodicity. These findings highlight the role of interfacial and intermolecular interactions in inducing and enhancing SOC in surface-adsorbed molecules, providing a new strategy for molecular spintronic materials without complex synthetic efforts.</description>

      <title>Mitigating parasitic contributions in measured piezoresponse for accurate determination of piezoelectric coefficients in Sc-alloyed-AlN thin films using piezo-response force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology to mitigate the effect of the parasitic electrostatic contribution usually present in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement for quantitative characterization of polycrystalline piezoelectric thin films using a case study on a set of Al1-xScxN thin films. It involves minimizing the voltage sensitivity of the measured piezoresponse by optimizing the optical lever sensitivity using the laser positioning of the beam-bounce system. Additionally, applying a dc-voltage offset (determined through Kelvin probe force microscopy) during PFM scans and positioning the probe over the interior or edge portion of the specimen are explored to minimize the local and non-local electrostatic tip-sample interaction. The results shows that the effective piezoelectric coefficient (d33-eff) of our c-axis oriented wurtzite (wz)-Al1.0Sc0.0N thin film is 4.9 pm per Volt. The highest enhancement in the d33-eff value occurred in the wz-Al0.58Sc0.42N thin film. Above x = 0.42, the d33-eff reduces due to phase-mixing of the wz-Al1-xScxN phase with cubic-Sc3AlN phase till the piezoelectricity finally disappear at x = 0.51</description>

      <title>Stable partial dislocation complexes in GaN as charge carrier lifetime modifiers for terahertz device applications by molecular dynamics and first-principle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite GaN is a promising material for applications in photoconductive THz radiation sources. For this purpose, the photogenerated charge carriers lifetime of the order of tenths of picoseconds is required. A controllable lifetime reduction may be considered to achieve by creating recombination active stable dislocation complexes formed by mobile basal-plane Shockley partial dislocations (PDs). In this work, formation pathways and stability of PD complexes in basal planes of wurzite GaN are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the formation of stable complexes by attractive interaction of two 30{\deg} or two 90{\deg} PDs with opposite Burgers vectors located in consecutive (0001) planes. Ones formed, these complexes change neither their positions, not the atomic configurations during simulated anneal at 1500 K up to the times of 5 ns. The MD results are used as an input for density functional theory calculations to refine the atomic structures of the complex cores and to investigate their electronic properties. The calculated band structures of GaN with 30{\deg}-30{\deg} and 90{\deg}-90{\deg} dislocation complexes indicate localized energy levels in the band gap near the top of the valence band and the conduction band bottom. The calculations of the partial electronic states density confirm the possibility of electron-hole recombination between the states localized at the PD complex cores. These recombination characteristics are distinctly reflected in the calculated absorption spectra. We conclude that creating such PD complexes in required concentration may be a tool for tailoring the recombination properties of wurtzite GaN for THz radiation generation applications.</description>

      <title>Constraints on magnetism and correlations in RuO$_2$ from lattice dynamics and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide experimental evidence for the absence of a magnetic moment in bulk RuO$_2$, a candidate altermagnetic material, by using a combination of M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, nuclear forward scattering, inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering, and density functional theory calculations. Using complementary M\"ossbauer and nuclear forward scattering we determine the $^{99}$Ru magnetic hyperfine splitting to be negligible. Inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering derived lattice dynamics of RuO$_2$ are compared to density functional theory calculations of varying flavors. Comparisons among theory with experiments indicate that electronic correlations, rather than magnetic order, are key in describing the lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell with efficiency of 18.2% enabled by a hole transport layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the thickness of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells is a key objective in order to reduce production cost and to improve sustainability. The major challenge for sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 cells is the recombination at the backside. In standard Cu(In,Ga)Se2 backside recombination is suppressed by a bandgap gradient, acting as a back surface field. This gradient is difficult to maintain in sub-micron thick absorbers. In this study, a hole transport layer passivates the back contact and enables efficient sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells without the need of a Ga gradient. The backside passivation by the hole transport layer is as effective as an optimized Ga gradient, resulting in a significant increase in open-circuit voltage by 80 mV in comparison to the reference sample without passivation. Moreover, the hole transport layer exhibits good transport properties, leading to a fill factor as high as 77%. Photoluminescence quantum yield of 0.15% and solar cell efficiency above 18% are demonstrated in sub-micron Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers.</description>

      <title>Surface Grafting of Graphene Flakes with Fluorescent Dyes: A Tailored Functionalization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controlled functionalization of graphene is critical for tuning and enhancing its properties, thereby expanding its potential applications. Covalent functionalization offers a deeper tuning of the geometric and electronic structure of graphene compared to non-covalent methods; however, the existing techniques involve side reactions and spatially uncontrolled functionalization, pushing research toward more selective and controlled methods. A promising approach is 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, successfully utilized with carbon nanotubes. In the present work, this method has been extended to graphene flakes with low defect concentration. A key innovation is the use of a custom-synthesized ylide with a protected amine group (Boc), facilitating subsequent attachment of functional molecules. Indeed, after Boc cleavage, fluorescent dyes (Atto 425, 465, and 633) were covalently linked via NHS ester derivatization. This approach represents a highly selective method of minimizing structural damage. Successful functionalization was demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy, confirming the effectiveness of the method. This novel approach offers a versatile platform, enabling its use in biological imaging, sensing, and advanced nanodevices. The method paves the way for the development of sensors and devices capable of anchoring a wide range of molecules, including quantum dots and nanoparticles. Therefore, it represents a significant advancement in graphene-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Clarification of the Spontaneous Polarization Direction in Crystals with Wurtzite Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wurtzite structure is one of the most frequently found crystal structures in modern semiconductors and its inherent spontaneous polarization is a defining materials property. Despite this significance, confusion has been rampant in the literature with respect to the orientation of the spontaneous polarization inside the unit cell of the wurtzite structure, especially for the technologically very relevant III-N compounds (AlN, GaN, InN). In particular, the spontaneous polarization has been reported to either point up or down for the same unit cell orientation, depending on the literature source - with important implications for, e.g., the carrier type and density expected at interfaces of heterostructures involving materials with wurtzite-structure. This perspective aims to resolve this ambiguity by reviewing available reports on the direction of the energetically preferred polarization direction in the presence of external electric fields, as well as atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images. While we use ferroelectric wurtzite AlScN as a key example, our conclusions are generalizable to other compounds with the same crystal structure. We demonstrate that a metal-polar unit cell must be associated with an upward polarization vector - which is contrary to long-standing conventional wisdom.</description>

      <title>Defect analysis of the $\beta$- to $\gamma$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the ion-irradiation-induced phase transition in gallium oxide (Ga2O3) from the $\beta$ to the $\gamma$ phase, the role of defects during the transformation, and the quality of the resulting crystal structure. Using a multi-method analysis approach including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode (RBS/c), Doppler broadening variable energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-VEPAS) and variable energy positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (VEPALS) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have characterized defects at all the relevant stages before, during, and after the phase transition. Reduction in backscattering yield was observed in RBS/c spectra after the transition to the $\gamma$ phase. This is corroborated by a significant decrease in the positron trapping center density due to generation of embedded vacancies intrinsic for the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 but too shallow in order to trap positrons. A comparison of the observed positron lifetime of $\gamma$-Ga2O3 with different theoretical models shows good agreement with the three-site $\gamma$ phase approach. A characteristic increase in the effective positron diffusion length and the positron lifetime at the transition point from $\beta$-Ga2O3 to $\gamma$-Ga2O3 enables visualization of the phase transition with positrons for the first time. Moreover, a subsequent reduction of these quantities with increasing irradiation fluence was observed, which we attribute to further evolution of the $\gamma$-Ga2O3 and changes in the gallium vacancy density as well as relative occupation in the crystal lattice.</description>

      <title>Crystal structural evolution of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ under pressure and its implication on possible electronic changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ru$_3$Sn$_7$, an intermetallic compound with advanced catalytic properties, exhibits a complex crystal structure and intriguing electronic properties, making it an attractive candidate for investigations under high-pressure (HP). The structural, vibrational and electronic band structure of this compound were investigated at HP up to ~ 20 GPa using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, micro-Raman, and density functional theory (DFT), respectively. Despite the local structural changes implied by a discernible reduction in the compressibility and distinct slope changes in the pressure evolution of the symmetric stretching vibrations of the Ru and Sn atoms around 8 GPa, the cubic structure is found to be stable throughout the pressure range. In support, our calculated phonon dispersion relation confirmed the stability of the cubic phase till the highest pressures. A comprehensive analysis of the Raman spectrum reveals the signatures of the pressure induced sudden strengthening of electron-phonon coupling as early as 3 GPa which is backed by a bounce in the phonon and electron density of states (DoS). Electronic structure calculations demonstrate that the metallic nature of Ru$_3$Sn$_7$ is preserved in the studied pressure range with a minor redistribution of electronic DoS across the Fermi level (EF). The band structure calculations predict intriguing changes in the electronic structure, revealing the pressure induced dp hybridization through the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone which is largely responsible for the observed reduction in the compressibility and enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling in Ru$_3$Sn$_7$.</description>

      <title>Computational assessment of non-polar and polar GaP terminations for photoelectrochemical water splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With photoelectrochemical water splitting being one of the most promising approaches for clean energy production and storage, the search for efficient photoelectrode materials is greater than ever. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a well-established semiconductor with suitable band edge positions that has already been successfully employed in photoelectrochemical solar cells. However, to utilize it as efficiently as possible, a proper understanding of its properties when interfaced with water is required, and this is currently lacking. In this work we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the properties of the aqueous interfaces of various GaP non-polar (110) and polar (001) terminations. We calculate their band alignment with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode potential and investigate their interfacial structural properties. Based on these properties we assess the capability of the various terminations to catalyze the reactions associated with water splitting and propose approaches for improving the performance of GaP for application in PECs.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Three-Dimensional Superstructures, Spinodal Decomposition, and Mechanical Response of Epitaxial Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal aluminum nitrides are a technologically important class of multifunctional ceramics. While the HfAlN system is to a large extent unexplored, we study phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical properties of rocksalt cubic (c-) phase and wurtzite-hexagonal (h-) phase Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films grown on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Single-crystal c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ films were obtained with $x &lt; 0.30$. Spinodal decomposition taking place during film deposition resulted in a three-dimensional checkerboard superstructure of AlN-rich and HfN-rich nanodomains, as opposed to a metastable cubic solid solution. Lattice-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray and electron diffraction reveals that the superstructure period is along all three &lt;100&gt; directions and scales almost linearly between 9-13 A with increasing Al content. For $x &gt; 0.41$, however, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ consisting of segregated Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a (0001) fiber texture forms. The nanoindentation hardness of these films increases sharply with x, from 26 GPa for HfNy, to 38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. The hardness drops to 22 GPa for the softer h-Hf1-xAlxNy, still remaining considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. In micropillar compression testing, c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ exhibits a linear elastic response up until strain burst, with brittle fracture occurring at a much higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$, on {110}&lt;011&gt; slip systems, which is attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits limited plasticity and a high yield stress followed by strain burst, attributed to the nanocrystalline structure.</description>

      <title>Interparticle heterostructures by spontaneous formation of Dirac nodal arc semimetal PtSn4 domains in nanoparticles produced by Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report on the spontaneous formation of highly ordered 2D layered domains of intermetallic phase PtSn4 in Sn nanoparticles of dimensions of the order of 10 nm during the gas aggregation process occurring in Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition. Phase identification is based on High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and on X-ray emission analysis coupled with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We propose that PtSn4-ordered domains precipitate inside Sn nanoparticles once the temperature drops below 520{\deg}C upon collisional cooling with room temperature Argon, while the nanoparticles persist longer in a liquid state. Sn matrix eventually solidifies upon the sudden temperature drop due to the supersonic expansion. 2D-layered PtSn4 domains create interparticle heterostructures that disrupt the spherical symmetry typical of gas aggregation processes and separate the Sn particle into distinct parts. The Dirac nodal arc semimetal character of PtSn4 makes it particularly interesting for studying the transport mechanisms in nanogranular films obtained by the soft-assembling of such nanoparticles, which feature a network of heterostructures showing sequences of alternate PtSn4 2D domains and metallic \b{eta}-Sn necks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the development of oxynitride thin films: A combinatorial investigation of the Al-Si-O-N system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxynitrides are used in a variety of applications including photocatalysts, high-k dielectrics or wear-resistant coatings and often show intriguing multi-functionality. To accelerate the co-optimization of the relevant material properties of these compositionally complex oxynitride systems, high-throughput synthesis and characterization methods are desirable. In the present work, three approaches were investigated to obtain orthogonal anion and cation gradients on the same substrate by magnetron sputtering. The different approaches included varying positions of the local reactive gas inlets and different combinations of target materials. The best performing approach was applied to screen a large two-dimensional area of the quaternary phase space within the Al-Si-O-N system. This material system is a promising candidate for transparent protective coatings with variable refractive indices. With only five depositions of combinatorial libraries, an anion composition range of 2-46% O/(N+O) and a cation composition range of 4-44% Si/(Al+Si) is covered. For lower oxygen and silicon contents, a region with hardness of up to 25 GPa is observed, where the material exhibits either wurtzite AlN or a composite microstructure. By increasing the deposition temperature to 400 {\deg}C, an extension of this region can be achieved. At higher oxygen and silicon contents, the structure of the samples is X-ray amorphous. In this structural region, an intimate correlation between hardness and refractive index is confirmed. The results of this study introduce a practical approach to perform high-throughput development of mixed anion materials, which is transferable to many materials systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging high fluence and low pressure for pulsed laser deposition of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F &gt; 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces.</description>

      <title>Large Topological Magnetic Optical Effects and Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Octupole Domains of an Altermagnet-like Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrochlore iridates have attracted significant interest due to their complex phase behavior arising from the interplay among electron correlations, quantum metric in flat bands, geometrically frustrated lattices, and topology induced by strong spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we focus on Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ thin films oriented along the (111) crystallographic direction. This quantum material, identified as an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect in transport experiments. Here we employ optical circular dichroism microscopy, to directly image ferroic octupole order and resolve all-in--all-out and all-out--all-in antiferromagnetic domains below the N\'eel temperature. Remarkably, despite the absence of a detectable net magnetic moment at zero applied magnetic field, we detected a large magnetic circular dichroism signal ($\sim 10^{-4}$) and Kerr effect ($\sim 10^{-4}$ radians) in zero magnetic field attributable to Berry curvature effects from Weyl nodes. Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is a non-collinear magnet with vanishing net moment and magnetic octupole order, similar to the recently proposed collinear d-wave altermagnets, allowing for magneto-optical responses and anomalous Hall effect. This finding likely represents the first demonstration of magnetic circular dichroism and Kerr effect in a topologically non-trivial quantum antiferromagnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Our work opens up the possibility of ultrafast domain switching in the terahertz frequency and the domain wall dynamics in the magnetic Weyl systems, which establishes the foundation for topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Nematic and Smectic Liquid Crystals with Sub-Molecular Spatial Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of highly polar three ring rod-shaped compounds with a terminal thiophene ring have been synthesized and the physical properties of a subset are reported in detail. On cooling from the isotropic fluid, they directly transition to a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal (NF) phase that shows the strongest spatial correlations corresponding to 1/3 of the molecular length (L/3). The set of thiophene compounds reported here have ferroelectric polarizations about 20% larger than that of usual ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal materials. Such large polarization values are due to the ~20% larger mass densities of these thiophene compounds compared to most of the NF materials with short terminal chains. These unusual properties are consequences of tighter molecular packing due to the lack of flexible terminal chains. Below the NF phase, compounds with a single nitro or two cyano polar groups on the terminal benzene ring exhibit a so far never observed smectic phase with periodicity ~1/3 the molecular length. Based on our experimental results, we propose a model of this phase featuring antipolar packing of the molecules within the layers.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Method for Modeling Creep-Fatigue Stress-Strain Behavior Using Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven machine learning approach for modeling one-dimensional stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading, utilizing experimental data from the nickel-based Alloy 617. The study employs uniaxial creep-fatigue test data acquired under various loading histories and compares two distinct neural network-based ODE models. The first model, known as the black-box model, comprehensively describes the strain-stress relationship using a Neural ODE equation. To interpret this black-box model, we apply the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) technique, transforming the black-box model into an equation-based model using symbolic regression. The second model, the Neural flow rule model, incorporates Hooke's Law for the linear elastic component, with the nonlinear part characterized by a Neural ODE. Both models are trained with experimental data to accurately reflect the observed stress-strain behavior. We conduct a detailed comparison with the standard Chaboche model, which includes three back stresses. Our results demonstrate that the neural network-based ODE models precisely capture the experimental creep-fatigue mechanical behavior, exceeding the standard Chaboche model's accuracy. Furthermore, an interpretable model derived from the black-box neural ODE model through symbolic regression achieves accuracy comparable to the Chaboche model, enhancing its interpretability. The results highlight the potential of neural network-based ODE models to depict complex creep-fatigue behavior, eliminating the necessity for experts to define a specific, material-focused model form.</description>

      <title>34 Examples of LLM Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry: Towards Automation, Assistants, Agents, and Accelerated Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.</description>

Abstract: It is well know that many full atomic multiplet codes are available for experimentalists to check x-ray absorption or emission spectra against known valence materials to identify effect valence configuration of transition metal ions as well as their ligands. This has grown recently with the continued development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a general tool that can characterize orbital, spin, charge, and lattice excitations in quantum materials. In this note, I show that all multiplet eigenstates for most $f^n$ configurations can be obtained analytically. I correct prior misprints in the literature and present new results for $f$-electrons. These results can serve as checks against new and developed numerical codes, and further provide experimentalists with deeper insights into the many configurations probed by advanced x-ray spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</title>

Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Quasi-bound layer breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moir\'e superlattices. Spatial modulation of interlayer distance, caused by the dislocations, generates effective potentials that promote emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer breathing modes inside perfect dislocations forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers. We show that for parallel MX$_2$ bilayers perfect dislocations host several quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above layer breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains, whereas for antiparallel bilayers only a single quasi-bound band arises near the edge dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</description>

      <title>Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</description>

      <title>Competitive Adsorption in Polymer Nanocomposites: The Molecular Weight and End-Group Effect Revealed by SANS and MD Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding polymer adsorption at interfaces is essential for designing advanced polymer-based nanomaterials with tailored interfacial properties. Although adsorption significantly influences the macroscopic properties of polymer composites and thin films, a comprehensive understanding of molecular weight (MW)-dependent adsorption remains challenging and controversial, particularly in polydisperse polymer systems, due to the limitations of experimental approaches. We investigate competitive adsorption in bidisperse poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) melts and find that shorter chains preferentially adsorb onto nanoparticle surfaces. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high density of terminal hydroxyl groups in short PEG chains strengthens hydrogen bonding at the interface, driving enthalpy-driven adsorption despite identical polymer backbones. This leads to a densely packed interfacial layer that alters the conformation of longer chains. These findings highlight the critical role of end-group functionality in interfacial polymer behavior and provide new insights for tailoring nanocomposite properties.</description>

      <title>Magnons from time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory and nonempirical Hubbard functionals</title>

Abstract: Spin excitations play a fundamental role in understanding magnetic properties of materials, and have significant technological implications for magnonic devices. However, accurately modeling these in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a fully first-principles approach for calculating spin-wave spectra based on time-dependent (TD) density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), using nonempirical Hubbard functionals. This approach is implemented in a general noncollinear formulation, enabling the study of magnons in both collinear and noncollinear magnetic systems. Unlike methods that rely on empirical Hubbard $U$ parameters to describe the ground state, and Heisenberg Hamiltonians for describing magnetic excitations, the methodology developed here probes directly the dynamical spin susceptibility (efficiently evaluated with TDDFPT throught the Liouville-Lanczos approach), and treats the linear variation of the Hubbard augmentation (in itself calculated non-empirically) in full at a self-consistent level. Furthermore, the method satisfies the Goldstone condition without requiring empirical rescaling of the exchange-correlation kernel or explicit enforcement of sum rules, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art techniques. We benchmark the novel computational scheme on prototypical transition-metal monoxides NiO and MnO, showing remarkable agreement with experiments and highlighting the fundamental role of these newly implemented Hubbard corrections. The method holds great promise for describing collective spin excitations in complex materials containing localized electronic states.</description>

      <title>Why Grain Growth is Not Curvature Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.</description>

      <title>Copper delocalization leads to ultralow thermal conductivity in chalcohalide CuBiSeCl2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</description>

      <title>In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</description>

Abstract: From nanoscale devices including sensors, electronics, or biocompatible coatings to macroscale structural, automotive or aerospace components, fundamental understanding of plasticity and fracture can guide the realization of materials that ensure safe and durable performance. Identifying the role of atomic-scale plasticity is crucial, especially for applications relying on brittle ceramics. Here, stress-intensity-controlled atomistic simulations of fracture in cubic Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N model systems demonstrate how $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$-scale plasticity - manifested as lattice distortions, phase transformation, nucleation and emission of dislocations - substantially affects the macroscale fracture toughness (K$_{Ic}$) and fracture strength (${\sigma}$$_{f}$) of brittle ceramics. The extent of plastic deformation in Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_{x}$N increases monotonically with the Al content (x), due to a corresponding decrease in cubic $\rightarrow$ hexagonal polymorph transition energies and unstable stacking fault energies. Overall, plasticity positively affects the mechanical properties, resulting in optimal combinations of strength and toughness for x~0.6. However, for x exceeding ~0.7, the benefits of plasticity diminish. The initial rise followed by a decline in K$_{Ic}$(x) and ${\sigma}$$_{f}$(x) is explained based on the interplay between phase transformation, shear-induced faulting, and tensile cleavage on the easiest fracture plane. The results highlight the impact of atomic-scale plasticity on observable properties and point to strategies for toughening ceramics through control of polymorph competition.</description>

Abstract: Ab initio based accurate simulation of phonon-assisted optical spectra of semiconductors at finite temperatures remains a formidable challenge, as it requires large supercells for phonon sampling and computationally expensive high-accuracy exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. In this work, we present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding and potential models to address this challenge with ab initio fidelity. By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude. This work establishes a pathway for high-throughput investigation of electron-phonon coupled phenomena in complex materials, overcoming traditional computational limitations arising from large supercell used with computationally expensive XC-functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powder samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. For single crystalline samples, $\epsilon$' can be sustained to remain above 10$^5$ and the dissipation factor below 10 in the temperature region of 280-340 K after a simple 'activation' process. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials. We propose a model suggesting the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.</description>

      <title>Role of seed layer in growing atomically flat TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films at the wafer scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.</description>

Abstract: Measurements are fundamental to knowledge creation in science, enabling consistent sharing of findings and serving as the foundation for scientific discovery. As machine learning systems increasingly transform scientific fields, the question of how to effectively evaluate these systems becomes crucial for ensuring reliable progress.
  In this review, we examine the current state and future directions of evaluation frameworks for machine learning in science. We organize the review around a broadly applicable framework for evaluating machine learning systems through the lens of statistical measurement theory, using materials science as our primary context for examples and case studies. We identify key challenges common across machine learning evaluation such as construct validity, data quality issues, metric design limitations, and benchmark maintenance problems that can lead to phantom progress when evaluation frameworks fail to capture real-world performance needs.
  By examining both traditional benchmarks and emerging evaluation approaches, we demonstrate how evaluation choices fundamentally shape not only our measurements but also research priorities and scientific progress. These findings reveal the critical need for transparency in evaluation design and reporting, leading us to propose evaluation cards as a structured approach to documenting measurement choices and limitations.
  Our work highlights the importance of developing a more diverse toolbox of evaluation techniques for machine learning in materials science, while offering insights that can inform evaluation practices in other scientific domains where similar challenges exist.</description>

      <title>Textured growth and electrical characterization of Zinc Sulfide on back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) compatible substrates</title>

Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450{\deg}C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400{\deg}C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism from coincident Van Hove singularities: application to $\kappa$-Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets is important for spintronics applications. Here we propose a microscopic template for stabilizing 2D altermagnetism through Van Hove singularities that are coincident in both energy and momentum. These coincident Van Hove singularities are a generic consequence of non-symmorphic symmetries in nine 2D space groups. Due to nontrivial symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian, these coincident Van Hove singularities allow new hopping interactions between the Van Hove singularities that do not appear in analogous Van Hove singularity based patch models for cuprates and graphene. We show these new interactions can give rise to various weak coupling, and BCS-based instabilities, including altermagnetism, nematicity, inter-band d-wave superconductivity, and orbital altermagnetic order. We apply our results to quasi-2D organic $\kappa$-Cl in which altermagnetism is known to appear.</description>

      <title>Recoverable strain in amorphous materials: the role of ongoing plastic events following initial elastic recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.</description>

      <title>Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</description>

      <title>Reduced Wannier representation for topological bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Electrons as intermediate charge carriers in ion transport through nanoscale channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>
