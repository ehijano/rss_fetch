      <title>MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</description>

      <title>TopoQA: a topological deep learning-based approach for protein complex structure interface quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even with the significant advances of AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-Multimer) and AlphaFold3 (AF3) in protein complex structure prediction, their accuracy is still not comparable with monomer structure prediction. Efficient quality assessment (QA) or estimation of model accuracy (EMA) models that can evaluate the quality of the predicted protein-complexes without knowing their native structures, are of key importance for protein structure generation and model selection. In this paper, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to capture the atomic-level topological information around residues and design a topological deep learning-based QA method, TopoQA, to assess the accuracy of protein complex interfaces. We integrate PH from topological data analysis into graph neural networks (GNNs) to characterize complex higher-order structures that GNNs might overlook, enhancing the learning of the relationship between the topological structure of complex interfaces and quality scores. Our TopoQA model is extensively validated based on the two most-widely used datasets, DBM55-AF2 and HAF2, along with our newly constructed ABAG-AF3 dataset to facilitate comparisons with AF3. For all three datasets, TopoQA outperforms AF-Multimer-based AF2Rank and shows an advantage over AF3 in nearly half of the targets. In particular, in the DBM55-AF2 dataset, a ranking loss of 73.6% lower than AF-Multimer-based AF2Rank is obtained. Further, other than AF-Multimer and AF3, we have also extensively compared with nearly-all the state-of-the-art models (as far as we know), it has been found that our TopoQA can achieve the highest Top 10 Hit-rate on the DBM55-AF2 dataset and the lowest ranking loss on the HAF2 dataset. Ablation experiments show that our topological features significantly improve the model performance. At the same time, our method also provides a new paradigm for protein structure representation learning.</description>

      <title>CPE-Pro: A Structure-Sensitive Deep Learning Method for Protein Representation and Origin Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structures are important for understanding their functions and interactions. Currently, many protein structure prediction methods are enriching the structure database. Discriminating the origin of structures is crucial for distinguishing between experimentally resolved and computationally predicted structures, evaluating the reliability of prediction methods, and guiding downstream biological studies. Building on works in structure prediction, We developed a structure-sensitive supervised deep learning model, Crystal vs Predicted Evaluator for Protein Structure (CPE-Pro), to represent and discriminate the origin of protein structures. CPE-Pro learns the structural information of proteins and captures inter-structural differences to achieve accurate traceability on four data classes, and is expected to be extended to more. Simultaneously, we utilized Foldseek to encode protein structures into "structure-sequences" and trained a protein Structural Sequence Language Model, SSLM. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that, compared to large-scale protein language models pre-trained on vast amounts of amino acid sequences, the "structure-sequence" enables the language model to learn more informative protein features, enhancing and optimizing structural representations. We have provided the code, model weights, and all related materials on https://github.com/GouWenrui/CPE-Pro-main.git.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the crucial biomolecules could be abiotically synthesized from geofluids in the deep interior of Earth and other planets and these formed biomolecules could potentially contribute to the early stage of the emergency of life.</description>
