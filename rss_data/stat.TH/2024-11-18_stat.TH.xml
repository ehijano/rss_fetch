      <title>To bootstrap or to rollout? An optimal and adaptive interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bootstrapping and rollout are two fundamental principles for value function estimation in reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce a novel class of Bellman operators, called subgraph Bellman operators, that interpolate between bootstrapping and rollout methods. Our estimator, derived by solving the fixed point of the empirical subgraph Bellman operator, combines the strengths of the bootstrapping-based temporal difference (TD) estimator and the rollout-based Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Specifically, the error upper bound of our estimator approaches the optimal variance achieved by TD, with an additional term depending on the exit probability of a selected subset of the state space. At the same time, the estimator exhibits the finite-sample adaptivity of MC, with sample complexity depending only on the occupancy measure of this subset. We complement the upper bound with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing that the additional term is unavoidable given a reasonable sample size. Together, these results establish subgraph Bellman estimators as an optimal and adaptive framework for reconciling TD and MC methods in policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric inference for impulse response functions using double/debiased machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimator for the impulse response function (IRF) in settings where a time series of interest is subjected to multiple discrete treatments, assigned over time, which can have a causal effect on future outcomes. The proposed estimator can rely on fully nonparametric relations between treatment and outcome variables, opening up the possibility to use flexible machine learning approaches to estimate IRFs. To this end, we extend the theory of DML from an i.i.d. to a time series setting and show that the proposed DML estimator for the IRF is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the parametric rate, allowing for semiparametric inference for dynamic effects in a time series setting. The properties of the estimator are validated numerically in finite samples by applying it to learn the IRF in the presence of serial dependence in both the confounder and observation innovation processes. We also illustrate the methodology empirically by applying it to the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic shocks.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Form based Multiple Contrast Tests for Comparison of Group Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing the mean vectors across different groups is a cornerstone in the realm of multivariate statistics, with quadratic forms commonly serving as test statistics. However, when the overall hypothesis is rejected, identifying specific vector components or determining the groups among which differences exist requires additional investigations. Conversely, employing multiple contrast tests (MCT) allows conclusions about which components or groups contribute to these differences. However, they come with a trade-off, as MCT lose some benefits inherent to quadratic forms. In this paper, we combine both approaches to get a quadratic form based multiple contrast test that leverages the advantages of both. To understand its theoretical properties, we investigate its asymptotic distribution in a semiparametric model. We thereby focus on two common quadratic forms - the Wald-type statistic and the Anova-type statistic - although our findings are applicable to any quadratic form.
  Furthermore, we employ Monte-Carlo and resampling techniques to enhance the test's performance in small sample scenarios. Through an extensive simulation study, we assess the performance of our proposed tests against existing alternatives, highlighting their advantages.</description>

      <title>Tropical combinatorics of max-linear Bayesian networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Dirichlet Forms for MCMC Optimal Scaling with Dependent Target Distributions on Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have played a significant role in statistics, physics, machine learning and others, and they are the only known general and efficient approach for some high-dimensional problems. The random walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm as the most classical MCMC algorithm, has had a great influence on the development and practice of science and engineering. The behavior of the RWM algorithm in high-dimensional problems is typically investigated through a weak convergence result of diffusion processes. In this paper, we utilize the Mosco convergence of Dirichlet forms in analyzing the RWM algorithm on large graphs, whose target distribution is the Gibbs measure that includes any probability measure satisfying a Markov property. The abstract and powerful theory of Dirichlet forms allows us to work directly and naturally on the infinite-dimensional space, and our notion of Mosco convergence allows Dirichlet forms associated with the RWM chains to lie on changing Hilbert spaces. Through the optimal scaling problem, we demonstrate the impressive strengths of the Dirichlet form approach over the standard diffusion approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Aggregation of Sample-Split Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference is often simplified by sample-splitting. This simplification comes at the cost of the introduction of randomness not native to the data. We propose a simple procedure for sequentially aggregating statistics constructed with multiple splits of the same sample. The user specifies a bound and a nominal error rate. If the procedure is implemented twice on the same data, the nominal error rate approximates the chance that the results differ by more than the bound. We illustrate the application of the procedure to several widely applied econometric methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Optimal Covariance-Adaptive Algorithms for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player selects among P actions from the power set of a set containing d base items. Adaptivity to the problem's structure is essential in order to obtain optimal regret upper bounds. As estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix can be manageable in practice, leveraging them should improve the regret. We design "optimistic" covariance-adaptive algorithms relying on online estimations of the covariance structure, called OLS-UCB-C and COS-V (only the variances for the latter). They both yields improved gap-free regret. Although COS-V can be slightly suboptimal, it improves on computational complexity by taking inspiration from ThompsonSampling approaches. It is the first sampling-based algorithm satisfying a T^1/2 gap-free regret (up to poly-logs). We also show that in some cases, our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where P &gt;&gt; d but also when P &lt;= d, which is not covered by existing analyses.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transfer Clustering: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general transfer learning framework for clustering given a main dataset and an auxiliary one about the same subjects. The two datasets may reflect similar but different latent grouping structures of the subjects. We propose an adaptive transfer clustering (ATC) algorithm that automatically leverages the commonality in the presence of unknown discrepancy, by optimizing an estimated bias-variance decomposition. It applies to a broad class of statistical models including Gaussian mixture models, stochastic block models, and latent class models. A theoretical analysis proves the optimality of ATC under the Gaussian mixture model and explicitly quantifies the benefit of transfer. Extensive simulations and real data experiments confirm our method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</description>
