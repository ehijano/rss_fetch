      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSO), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V+\lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We focus on three specific RBSOs: the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Let $\Lambda_\Psi$ denote the strength of interaction between two neighboring blocks. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\epsilon$ for a small constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, under the condition $ W^{d/4}/\Lambda_\Psi\ll\lambda\ll 1$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result proved in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously establish an Anderson localization-delocalization transition of RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies.
  Our proof is based on a nontrivial extension of the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Expected extremal area of facets of random polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extremal properties of spherical random polytopes, the convex hull of random points chosen from the unit Euclidean sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The extremal properties of interest are the expected values of the maximum and minimum surface area among facets. We determine the asymptotic growth in every fixed dimension, up to absolute constants.</description>

      <title>Optimal $W_1$ and Berry-Esseen bound between the spectral radius of large Chiral non-Hermitian random matrices and Gumbel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the chiral non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with parameters $n$ and $v$ and the non Hermiticity parameter $\tau=0$ and let $(\zeta_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be its $n$ eigenvalues with positive $x$-coordinate. Set $$X_n:=\sqrt{\log s_n}\left(\frac{2n \max_{1\le i\le n}|\zeta_i|^2-2\sqrt{n(n+v)}}{\sqrt{2n+v}}-a(s_{n})\right)$$ with $s_n=n(n+v)/(2n+v)$ and $a(s_n)=\sqrt{\log s_n}-\frac{\log(\sqrt{2\pi}\log s_n)}{\sqrt{\log s_n}}.$ It was proved in \cite{JQ} that $X_n$ converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$. In this paper, we give in further that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log s_n}{(\log\log s_n)^2}W_1\left(F_n, \Lambda\right)=\frac{1}{2}$$ and the Berry-Esseen bound $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log s_n}{(\log\log s_n)^2}\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}|F_n(x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{1}{2e}.$$
  Here, $F_n$ is the distribution (function) of $X_n.$</description>

      <title>The voter model on random regular graphs with random rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the voter model with binary opinions on a random regular graph with $n$ vertices of degree $d \geq 3$, subject to a rewiring dynamics in which pairs of edges are rewired, i.e., broken into four half-edges and subsequently reconnected at random. A parameter $\nu \in (0,\infty)$ regulates the frequency at which the rewirings take place, in such a way that any given edge is rewired exponentially at a rate $\nu$ in the limit as $n\to\infty$. We show that, under the joint law of the random rewiring dynamics and the random opinion dynamics, the fraction of vertices with either one of the two opinions converges on time scale $n$ to the Fisher-Wright diffusion with an explicit diffusion constant $\vartheta_{d,\nu}$ in the limit as $n\to\infty$. In particular, we identify $\vartheta_{d,\nu}$ in terms of a continued-fraction expansion and analyse its dependence on $d$ and $\nu$. A key role in our analysis is played by the set of discordant edges, which constitutes the boundary between the sets of vertices carrying the two opinions.</description>

      <title>The variance-gamma product distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the exact probability density function of the product of $N$ independent variance-gamma random variables with zero location parameter. We then apply this formula to derive formulas for the cumulative distribution function and the characteristic function, as well as asymptotic approximations for the probability density function, tail probabilities and the quantile function. As special cases, we obtain some key distributional properties for the product of $N$ independent asymmetric Laplace random variables and mixed products of independent Laplace and zero mean normal random variables.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Overlaps of Random Covariance Matrices and their Submatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the singular vectors of any $m \times n$ submatrix of a rectangular $M \times N$ Gaussian matrix and study their asymptotic overlaps with those of the full matrix, in the macroscopic regime where $N \,/\, M\,$, $m \,/\, M$ as well as $n \,/\, N$ converge to fixed ratios. Our method makes use of the dynamics of the singular vectors and of specific resolvents when the matrix coefficients follow Brownian trajectories. We obtain explicit forms for the limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps for right and left singular vectors in the bulk of both spectra, for any initial matrix $A\,$. When it is null, this corresponds to the Marchenko-Pastur setup for covariance matrices, and our formulas simplify into Cauchy-like functions.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and overlap concentration in optimal Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we consider models of optimal Bayesian inference of finite-rank tensor products. We add to the model a linear channel parametrized by $h$. We show that at every interior differentiable point $h$ of the free energy (associated with the model), the overlap concentrates at the gradient of the free energy and the minimum mean-square error converges to a related limit. In other words, the model is replica-symmetric at every differentiable point. At any signal-to-noise ratio, such points $h$ form a full-measure set (hence $h=0$ belongs to the closure of these points). For a sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratio, we show that every interior point is a differentiable point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a queue with the Erlang service system and whose arrivals are governed by a counting process in which there is a possibility of finitely many arrivals in an infinitesimal time interval. We call it the Erlang queue with multiple arrivals. Some of its distributional properties are obtained that includes the state-phase probabilities, the mean queue length and the distribution of busy period etc. Also, we study a time-changed variant of it by subordinating it with an independent inverse stable subordinator where we obtain its state probabilities and the mean queue length.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov exponent for the random field Ising transfer matrix, in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random $2 \times 2$ matrices appearing in the analysis of several statistical mechanical models with disorder, extending a previous treatment of the critical case (Giacomin and Greenblatt, ALEA 19 (2022), 701-728) by significantly weakening the assumptions on the disorder distribution. The argument we give completely revisits and improves the previous proof. As a key novelty we build a probability that is close to the Furstenberg probability, i.e. the invariant probability of the Markov chain corresponding to the evolution of the direction of a vector in ${\mathbb R}^2$ under the action of the random matrices, in terms of the ladder times of a centered random walk which is directly related to the random matrix sequence. We then show that sharp estimates on the ladder times (renewal) process lead to a sharp control on the probability measure we build and, in turn, to the control of its distance from the Furstenberg probability.</description>

      <title>The Berry-Esseen Bound for High-dimensional Self-normalized Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the Gaussian approximation of the coordinate-wise maximum of self-normalized statistics in high-dimensional settings. We derive an explicit Berry-Esseen bound under weak assumptions on the absolute moments. When the third absolute moment is finite, our bound scales as $\log^{5/4}(d)/n^{1/8}$ where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimension. Hence, our bound tends to zero as long as $\log(d)=o(n^{1/10})$. Our results on self-normalized statistics represent substantial advancements, as such a bound has not been previously available in the high-dimensional central limit theorem (CLT) literature.</description>

      <title>Detecting Abrupt Changes in Point Processes: Fundamental Limits and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting abrupt changes (i.e., large jump discontinuities) in the rate function of a point process. The rate function is assumed to be fully unknown, non-stationary, and may itself be a random process that depends on the history of event times. We show that abrupt changes can be accurately identified from observations of the point process, provided the changes are sharper than the "smoothness'' of the rate function before the abrupt change. This condition is also shown to be necessary from an information-theoretic point of view. We then apply our theory to several special cases of interest, including the detection of significant changes in piecewise smooth rate functions and detecting super-spreading events in epidemic models on graphs. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our methods through a detailed empirical analysis of both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Is Stochastic Gradient Descent Effective? A PDE Perspective on Machine Learning processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the behaviour of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a widely used method in supervised learning for optimizing neural network weights via a minimization of non-convex loss functions. Since the pioneering work of E, Li and Tai (2017), the underlying structure of such processes can be understood via parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, which are at the core of our analysis. Even if Fokker-Planck equations have a long history and a extensive literature, almost nothing is known when the potential is non-convex or when the diffusion matrix is degenerate, and this is the main difficulty that we face in our analysis.
  We identify two different regimes: in the initial phase of SGD, the loss function drives the weights to concentrate around the nearest local minimum. We refer to this phase as the drift regime and we provide quantitative estimates on this concentration phenomenon. Next, we introduce the diffusion regime, where stochastic fluctuations help the learning process to escape suboptimal local minima. We analyze the Mean Exit Time (MET) and prove upper and lower bounds of the MET. Finally, we address the asymptotic convergence of SGD, for a non-convex cost function and a degenerate diffusion matrix, that do not allow to use the standard approaches, and require new techniques. For this purpose, we exploit two different methods: duality and entropy methods.
  We provide new results about the dynamics and effectiveness of SGD, offering a deep connection between stochastic optimization and PDE theory, and some answers and insights to basic questions in the Machine Learning processes: How long does SGD take to escape from a bad minimum? Do neural network parameters converge using SGD? How do parameters evolve in the first stage of training with SGD?</description>

      <title>Critical Exponents on Hyperbolic Surfaces with Long Boundaries and the Asymptotic Weil-Petersson Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the critical exponent random variable $\delta_X$ on moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundary, using the normalized Weil-Petersson measures $d\mu_{WP}$ as probability measures. We use the spine graph construction of Bowditch and Epstein to compare this random variable to the corresponding critical exponent random variable $\delta_\Gamma$ on moduli spaces of metric ribbon graphs with the normalized Kontsevich measures $d\mu_K$, proving an asymptotic convergence-in-mean result in the long boundary length regime. In particular, we show that $d\mu_K$ approximately pulls back to $d\mu_{WP}$ with quantitative uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>Formulation a new SIR model with non-local mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we develop a mobility-based Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to elucidate the dynamics of pandemic propagation. While traditional SIR models within the field of epidemiology aptly characterize transitions among susceptible, infected, and recovered states, they typically neglect the inherent spatial mobility of particles. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dynamical SIR model that incorporates nonlocal spatial motion for three distinct particle types, thereby bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and real-world mobility patterns. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing the long-term behavior of this dynamic system, with specific emphasis on the computation of first and second moments. We propose a new reproduction number $R_0^m$ and compare it with the classical reproduction number $R_0$ in the traditional SIR model. Furthermore, we rigorously examine the phenomenon of intermittency within the context of this enhanced SIR model. The results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of pandemic spread dynamics, considering both the interplay between disease transmission and population mobility and the impact of spatial motion on the system's behavior over time.</description>

      <title>Connecting SPDE to SGMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) derived from the Fokker-Planck equation associated with Score-based Generative Models. We modify the standard Fokker-Planck equation to better represent practical SGMs and introduce noise to mitigate potential discretization issues. The primary goal is to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for this SPDE. This aspect requires careful consideration due to the time-dependent operator and unbounded domain. To overcome these hurdles, we employ a variational approach and introduce a novel space inspired by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators. By demonstrating that this space and its subspace satisfy the necessary assumptions, they establish the existence of a solution for the given SPDE.</description>

Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we delve deeply into the concept of multivariate total positivity, defining it in accordance with a direction. We rigorously explore numerous salient properties, shedding light on the nuances that characterize this notion. Furthermore, our research extends to establishing distinct forms of dependence among the order statistics of a sample from a distribution function. Our analysis aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the interrelationships within multivariate total positivity and its implications for statistical analysis and probability theory.</description>

      <title>$p$-Energy forms on fractals: recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we survey recent progress on self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar fractals, where $p\in(1,\infty)$. While for $p=2$ the notion of such forms coincides with that of self-similar Dirichlet forms and there have been plenty of studies on them since the late 1980s, studies on the case of $p\in(1,\infty)\setminus\{2\}$ was initiated much later in 2004 by Herman, Peirone and Strichartz [Potential Anal. 20 (2004), 125--148] and Strichartz and Wong [Nonlinearity 17 (2004), 595--616] and no essential progress on this case had been made since then until a few years ago. The recent progress by Kigami, Shimizu, Cao--Gu--Qiu and Murugan--Shimizu has established the existence of such $p$-energy forms on general post-critically finite (p.-c.f.) self-similar sets and on large classes of low-dimensional infinitely ramified self-similar sets, and the authors have proved further detailed properties of these forms and associated $p$-harmonic functions, mainly for p.-c.f. self-similar sets. This article is devoted to a review of these results, focusing on the most recent developments by the authors and illustrating them in the simplest non-trivial setting of the two-dimensional standard Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-scale dynamics of the solution to a nonlinear stochastic heat equation (SHE) in dimensions $d \geq 3$ with long-range dependence. This equation is driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise, which is white in time and coloured in space with non-integrable spatial covariance that decays at the rate of $|x|^{-\kappa}$ at infinity, where $\kappa \in (2, d)$. Inspired by recent studies on SHE and KPZ equations driven by noise with compactly supported spatial correlation, we demonstrate that the correlations persist in the large-scale limit. The fluctuations of the diffusively scaled solution converge to the solution of a stochastic heat equation with additive noise whose correlation is the Riesz kernel of degree $-\kappa$. Moreover, the fluctuations converge as a distribution-valued process in the optimal H\"older topologies.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_1,X_2, \ldots $ and $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots$ be i.i.d. random uniform points in a bounded domain $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with smooth or polygonal boundary. Given $n,m,k \in \mathbb{N}$, define the {\em two-sample $k$-coverage threshold} $R_{n,m,k}$ to be the smallest $r$ such that each point of $ \{Y_1,\ldots,Y_m\}$ is covered at least $k$ times by the disks of radius $r$ centred on $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. We obtain the limiting distribution of $R_{n,m,k}$ as $n \to \infty$ with $m= m(n) \sim \tau n$ for some constant $\tau &gt;0$, with $k $ fixed. If $A$ has unit area, then $n \pi R_{n,m(n),1}^2 - \log n$ is asymptotically Gumbel distributed with scale parameter $1$ and location parameter $\log \tau$. For $k &gt;2$, we find that $n \pi R_{n,m(n),k}^2 - \log n - (2k-3) \log \log n$ is asymptotically Gumbel with scale parameter $2$ and a more complicated location parameter involving the perimeter of $A$; boundary effects dominate when $k &gt;2$. For $k=2$ the limiting cdf is a two-component extreme value distribution with scale parameters 1 and 2. We also give analogous results for higher dimensions, where the boundary effects dominate for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Percolation games on rooted, edge-weighted random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a rooted Galton-Watson tree $T$, to each of whose edges we assign, independently, a weight that equals $+1$ with probability $p_{1}$, $0$ with probability $p_{0}$ and $-1$ with probability $p_{-1}=1-p_{1}-p_{0}$. We play a game on a realization of this tree, involving two players and a token that is allowed to be moved from where it is currently located, say a vertex $u$ of $T$, to any child $v$ of $u$. The players begin with initial capitals that amount to $i$ and $j$ units respectively, and a player wins if either she is the first to amass a capital worth $\kappa$ units, where $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ is prespecified, or she is able to move the token to a leaf vertex, from where her opponent cannot move it any farther, or her opponent's capital is the first to dwindle to $0$. This paper is concerned with analyzing the probabilities of the three possible outcomes such a game may culminate in, as well as with finding conditions under which the expected duration of the game is finite. Of particular interest to us is the exploration of criteria that guarantee the probability of draw in such a game to be $0$. The theory we develop is further supported by observations obtained via computer simulations, providing a deeper insight into how the above-mentioned probabilities behave as the underlying parameters and / or offspring distributions are allowed to vary. We include in this paper conjectures pertaining to the behaviour of the probability of draw in our game (including a phase transition phenomenon, in which the probability of draw goes from being $0$ to being strictly positive) as the parameter-pair $(p_{0},p_{1})$ is varied suitably while keeping the underlying offspring distribution of $T$ fixed.</description>

      <title>A Kaczmarz-Inspired Method for Orthogonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper asks if it is possible to orthogonalize a set of $n$ linearly independent unit vectors in $n$ dimensions by only considering random pairs of vectors at a time. In particular, at each step one accesses a random pair of vectors and can replace them with some different basis for their span. If one could instead deterministically decide which pair of vectors to access, one could run the Gram-Schmidt procedure. In our setting, however, the pair is selected at random, so the answer is less clear.
  We provide a positive answer to the question: given a pair of vectors at each iteration, replace one with its component perpendicular to the other, renormalized. This produces a sequence that almost surely converges to an orthonormal set. Quantitatively, we can measure the rate convergence in terms of the condition number $\kappa(A)$ of the square matrix $A$ formed by taking the $n$ vectors to be its columns. When the condition number is initially very large, we prove a rapidly decreasing upper bound on the expected logarithm of the condition number after $t$ iterations. The bound initially decreases by $O(1/n^2)$ each iteration, but the decrease tapers off as the condition number improves. We then show $O(n^4/\delta\varepsilon^2+n^3\log(\kappa(A))\log\log(\kappa(A)))$ iterations suffice to bring the condition number below $1+\varepsilon$ with probability $1-\delta$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-form Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include inequality measurement, the variance of a bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT, provide several cases where explicit solutions are obtained, and give general lower bounds of the optimal transport costs. For a wide class of cost functions, including the rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit square.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the two point correlation matrix $ \textbf{M}= (\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle)_{1\leq i,j\leq N} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model has the property that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $K_\epsilon&gt;0$, that is independent of $N$, such that
  \[ \mathbb{P}\big( \| \textbf{M} \|_{\text{op}} \leq K_{\epsilon}\big) \geq 1- \epsilon \] for $N$ large enough, for suitable interaction and external field parameters $(\beta,h)$ in the replica symmetric region. In other words, the operator norm of $\textbf{M}$ is of order one with high probability. Our results are in particular valid for all $ (\beta,h)\in (0,1)\times (0,\infty) $ and thus complement recently obtained results in \cite{EAG,BSXY} that imply the operator norm boundedness of $\textbf{M}$ for all $\beta&lt;1$ in the special case of vanishing external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the scope of Azadkia-Chatterjee's dependence coefficient between a scalar response $Y$ and a multivariate covariate $X$ to the case where $X$ takes values in a general metric space. Particular attention is paid to the case where $X$ is a curve. Although extending this framework at the population level is relatively straightforward, analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the estimator proves to be complex. This complexity is largely related to the nearest neighbor structure of the infinite-dimensional covariate sample, leading us to explore a topic that has not been previously addressed in the literature. The primary contribution of this paper is to provide insights into this issue and propose strategies to address it. Our findings also have significant implications for other graph-based methods facing similar challenges.</description>

Abstract: Balister, the second author, Groenland, Johnston and Scott recently showed that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{3/4}$ many unordered sequences that occur as degree sequences of graphs. Combining limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions with a new bijective connection between a class of random walk trajectories and a subset counting formula from additive number theory, we describe $C$ in terms of Walkup's number of rooted plane trees. The bijection is related to an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula. Our main result complements a result of Stanley, that ordered graphical sequences are related to quasi-forests.</description>

      <title>A variational perspective on the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the position and velocity of particles under the influence of external confinement, interaction, friction, and stochastic force. It is well-known that this equation can be formally seen as a dissipative Hamiltonian system in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In order to better understand this geometric formalism, we introduce a time-discrete variational scheme, solutions of which converge to the solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as time step vanishes; in particular, this provides a new proof of the existence of a weak solution to the equation. The variational scheme combines the symplectic Euler scheme and the (degenerate) implicit steepest descent, and updates the probability density at each iteration first in the velocity variable then in the position variable.
  The algorithm leverages the geometric structure of the equation, and has several desirable properties. Energy functionals involved in each variational problem are geodesically-convex, which implies the unique solvability of the problem. Furthermore, the correct dissipation of the Hamiltonian is observed at the discrete level up to higher order errors controlled by the second moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, connecting the number $S_n$ of score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers $N_n$ from additive number theory. Our proof utilizes the lattice path representation of score sequences by Erd\H{o}s and Moser, and remarks by Kleitman added to an article of Moser regarding cyclic shifts of such paths. The connection between $S_n$ and $N_n$ is an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory. We highlight the utility of such formulas, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture that $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$, where $C$ is described in terms of $N_n$.</description>

      <title>Erlang Model for Multi-type Data Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of information technology, requirements for data flow have become diverse. When multi-type data flow (MDF) is used, games, videos, calls, etc. are all requirements. There may be a constant switch between these requirements, and also multiple requirements at the same time. Therefore, the demands of users change over time, which makes traditional teletraffic analysis not directly applicable. This paper proposes probabilistic models for the requirement of MDF, and analyzes in three states: non-tolerance, tolerance and delay. When the requirement random variables are co-distributed with respect to time, we prove the practicability of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) from a mathematical perspective by discretizing time and error analysis. An algorithm of pre-allocating resources is given to guild the construction of base resources.</description>

      <title>Consistency of MLE in partially observed diffusion models on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic) parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the diffusion process. We show that, given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>
