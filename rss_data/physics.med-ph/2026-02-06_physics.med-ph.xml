      <title>Laterally Oscillating Trajectory for Undersampling Slices: LOTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: While spiral sampling offers SNR advantages for diffusion MRI, its acceleration with simultaneous multislice remains relatively unexplored. This study introduces Laterally Oscillating Trajectory for Undersampling Slices (LOTUS), which is a 3D spiral-like k-space trajectory that aims to minimize g-factor via controlled incoherent aliasing. To aid in validation, we also introduce a robust method to estimate g-factor for iterative non-Cartesian reconstructions.
  Methods: Simulated data sampling of a numerical phantom was performed using LOTUS and several acquisition schemes proposed by others to quantitatively compare the resulting image quality when compared to a known ground truth. Diffusion-weighted in vivo brain data from two subjects was acquired with two in-plane acceleration factors (2x and 4x), and two slice acceleration factors (2x and 4x). Estimated g-factor maps and fractional anisotropy maps were calculated to quantitatively and qualitatively compare trajectory performance. For both simulation and in vivo, reconstructions both with and without compressed sensing were utilized.
  Results: Simulations generally showed decreased g-factor (20%-31%, depending on trajectory, at highest undersampling rate) and improved reconstruction accuracy (mean-square error, structural similarity index, and entropy metrics) for LOTUS compared to the other trajectories. The in vivo acquisitions demonstrated g-factor benefits and qualitative image quality improvements that mirrored the simulation results. For both simulation and in vivo, improvements for LOTUS increased for higher numbers of simultaneous slices.
  Conclusion: By enabling higher rates of slice acceleration, LOTUS shows promise for decreasing scan time, which is especially beneficial for diffusion MRI.</description>

      <title>Towards Segmenting the Invisible: An End-to-End Registration and Segmentation Framework for Weakly Supervised Tumour Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liver tumour ablation presents a significant clinical challenge: whilst tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI, they are often effectively invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue. This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the "domain gap" and "feature absence" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: I. Spatio-Temporal Imaging of Wave Packets in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.</description>

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: III. Tailoring Complex Spatio-Temporal Focusing Laws To Overcome Reverberations in Reflection Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. In complex media, a fundamental limit is the multiple scattering phenomenon that completely blurs the imaging process in depth. Matrix imaging can provide a relevant framework for solving this problem. As it proved to be an adequate tool for probing reverberations in speckle [E. Giraudat et al., Part I], we will show how it can be used to tailor complex spatio-temporal focusing laws to monitor the interference between the multiply-reflected paths and the ballistic component of the wave-field. To do so, we extend the distortion matrix concept to the frequency domain. An iterative phase reversal process operated from the space-time Fourier space is then used to compensate for reverberations and optimize both the axial and transverse resolution of the confocal image. Here, we first present an experimental proof-of-concept consisting in imaging a tissue-mimicking phantom through a reverberating plate before outlining the potential and the limits of this strategy for transcranial ultrasound and beyond.</description>

      <title>Self-Portrait of the Focusing Process in Speckle: II. Gouy Phase Shift for Defocus Correction and Pixel Depth Reassignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13901</link>

Abstract: This is the second article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for aberration correction and reverberation compensation in reflection imaging. When probing heterogeneous media with waves, we have to cope with multi-scale fluctuations of the wave velocity. On the one hand, short-scale heterogeneities induce back-scattered echoes whose random interference generate a speckle pattern on the beamformed image. On the other hand, large-scale fluctuations of the wave-velocity can distort the focused wave-fronts, resulting in aberrations on the same image. In this paper, we show how the self-portrait of the wave evolves as a function of the speed-of-sound model. Strikingly, a Gouy phase shift is observed when the speed-of-sound model is optimal. This particularly sensitive feature enables: (i) an optimization of the speed-of-sound model for each pixel of the image; (ii) a local and fine compensation of defocus across the field-of-view, thereby compensating for most aberrations in the image. Experiment in a tissue-mimicking phantom and numerical simulations are first presented to validate our method. It is then applied to in-vivo liver data of a difficult-to-image patient. The speed-of-sound optimization allows an axial compensation of aberrations and a depth-reassignment of each singly-scattered echo to the actual position of the associated scatterer. As distance measurement is often critical for diagnosis, such a wave speed optimization can be crucial for ultrasound but also for any other imaging methods based on the principle of echo-location.</description>
