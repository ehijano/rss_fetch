      <title>Gravity potential determination based on China Space Station Dual-frequency microwave links frequency transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station (CSS) is currently in orbit and carries the high-precision optical atomic clock with stability of approximately $2.0 \times 10^{-15} / \sqrt{\tau}$ in its experiment module. We have developed a model to determine the gravity potential (GP) based on the gravity frequency shift equation and have created both one-way and dual-frequency transfer models up to $c^{-4}$. These models consider effects from the troposphere, ionosphere, and solid Earth tides. The proposed model is suitable for measurements at the magnitude of $10^{-19}$. Based on the CSS mission, we conducted the simulation experiments. The results indicate that when processing the simulation frequency signal using the proposed model, we can obtain the GP with the accuracies of $ (1.13\pm0.71)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $ (0.09\pm0.89)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, and $(0.66\pm1.18)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$ for cutoff elevation angles of $5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$ and $15^{\circ}$, respectively. With the high-precision optical atomic clock onboard the CSS, the proposed model enables us to measure the GP differences in the magnitude of centimeter-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning Weather Models from Data with WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>

      <title>LASSE: Learning Active Sampling for Storm Tide Extremes in Non-Stationary Climate Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they ``generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate a 100% precision retrieving the rare destructive storms training using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19{\deg} E05{\deg}). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of {\pounds} -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19{\deg}.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24{\deg}. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|{\deg} for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10{\deg}. 0|--|19{\deg}. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17{\deg}. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.{\deg}2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25{\deg}.1 \pm 0{\deg}.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27{\deg}.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.</description>

      <title>Thermal Induced Structural Competitiveness and Metastability of Body-centered Cubic Iron under Non-Equilibrium Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and stability of iron near melting at multi-megabar pressures are of significant interest in high pressure physics and earth and planetary sciences. While the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase is generally recognized as unstable at lower temperatures, its stability relative to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at high temperatures (approximately 0.5 eV) in the Earth's inner core (IC) remains a topic of ongoing theoretical and experimental debate. Our ab initio calculations show a significant drop in energy, the emergence of a plateau and a local minimum in the potential energy surface, and stabilization of all phonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (&gt;1-1.5 eV). These effects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and the face-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of the BCC structure. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of BCC iron is enhanced by its substantial lattice vibration entropy. This thermally induced structural competitiveness and metastability under non-equilibrium conditions provide a clear theoretical framework for understanding iron phase relations and solidification processes, both experimentally and in the IC.</description>

      <title>Integral equations for flexural-gravity waves: analysis and numerical methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a fast and accurate method for the scattering of flexural-gravity waves by a thin plate of varying thickness overlying a fluid of infinite depth. This problem commonly arises in the study of sea ice and ice shelves, which can have complicated heterogeneities that include ridges and rolls. With certain natural assumptions on the thickness, we present an integral equation formulation for solving this class of problems and analyze its mathematical properties. The integral equation is then discretized and solved using a high-order-accurate, FFT-accelerated algorithm. The speed, accuracy, and scalability of this approach are demonstrated through a variety of illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>A Novel Diffusion Model for Pairwise Geoscience Data Generation with Unbalanced Training Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the advent of generative AI technologies has made transformational impacts on our daily lives, yet its application in scientific applications remains in its early stages. Data scarcity is a major, well-known barrier in data-driven scientific computing, so physics-guided generative AI holds significant promise. In scientific computing, most tasks study the conversion of multiple data modalities to describe physical phenomena, for example, spatial and waveform in seismic imaging, time and frequency in signal processing, and temporal and spectral in climate modeling; as such, multi-modal pairwise data generation is highly required instead of single-modal data generation, which is usually used in natural images (e.g., faces, scenery). Moreover, in real-world applications, the unbalance of available data in terms of modalities commonly exists; for example, the spatial data (i.e., velocity maps) in seismic imaging can be easily simulated, but real-world seismic waveform is largely lacking. While the most recent efforts enable the powerful diffusion model to generate multi-modal data, how to leverage the unbalanced available data is still unclear. In this work, we use seismic imaging in subsurface geophysics as a vehicle to present ``UB-Diff'', a novel diffusion model for multi-modal paired scientific data generation. One major innovation is a one-in-two-out encoder-decoder network structure, which can ensure pairwise data is obtained from a co-latent representation. Then, the co-latent representation will be used by the diffusion process for pairwise data generation. Experimental results on the OpenFWI dataset show that UB-Diff significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) score and pairwise evaluation, indicating the generation of reliable and useful multi-modal pairwise data.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Hybrid Neural Network Architecture for Porous Media: Integrating Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Improved Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Porous media is widely distributed in nature, found in environments such as soil, rock formations, and plant tissues, and is crucial in applications like subsurface oil and gas extraction, medical drug delivery, and filtration systems. Understanding the properties of porous media, such as the permeability and formation factor, is crucial for comprehending the physics of fluid flow within them. We present a novel fusion model that significantly enhances memory efficiency compared to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Although the CNNs have been employed to estimate these properties from high-resolution, three-dimensional images of porous media, they often suffer from high memory consumption when processing large-dimensional inputs. Our model integrates a simplified CNN with a graph neural network (GNN), which efficiently consolidates clusters of pixels into graph nodes and edges that represent pores and throats, respectively. This graph-based approach aligns naturally with the porous medium structure, enabling large-scale simulations that are challenging with traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the GNN Grad-CAM technology to provide new interpretability and insights into fluid dynamics in porous media. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of the fusion model in predicting porous medium properties is superior to that of the standalone CNN, while its total parameter count is nearly two orders of magnitude lower. This innovative approach highlights the transformative potential of hybrid neural network architectures in advancing research on fluid flow in porous media.</description>

      <title>A machine learning algorithm for predicting naturalized flow duration curves at human influenced sites and multiple catchment scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regional flow duration curves (FDCs) often reflect streamflow influenced by human activities. We propose a new machine learning algorithm to predict naturalized FDCs at human influenced sites and multiple catchment scales. Separate Meta models are developed to predict probable flow at discrete exceedance probabilities across catchments spanning multiple stream orders. Discrete exceedance flows reflect the stacking of k-fold cross-validated predictions from trained base ensemble machine learning models with and without hyperparameter tuning. The quality of individual base models reflects random stratified shuffling of spilt catchment records for training and testing. A Meta model is formed by retraining minimum variance base models that are bias corrected and used to predict final flows at selected percentiles that quantify uncertainty. Separate Meta models are developed and used to predict naturalised stochastic flows at other discrete exceedance probabilities along the duration curve. Efficacy of the new method is demonstrated for predicting naturalized stochastic FDCs at human influenced gauged catchments and ungauged stream reaches of unknown influences across Otago New Zealand. Important findings are twofold. First, independent observations of naturalised Median flows compare within few percent of the 50th percentile predictions from the FDC models. Second, the naturalised Meta models predict FDCs that outperform the calibrated SWAT model FDCs at gauge sites in the Taieri Freshwater Management Unit: Taieri at Tiroiti, Taieri at Sutton Creek, and Taieri River at Outram. Departures in the naturalised reference state are interpreted as flow regime changes across the duration curves. We believe these Meta models will be useful in predicting naturalised catchment FDCs across other New Zealand regions using physical catchment features available from the national data base.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial (TPP) and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. These algorithms have very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using Gaussian quadrature, and the tendencies of prognostic variables are obtained by integration all the source terms and the fluxes across the cell boundaries. This shallow water dynamic core exhibits outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly double precision round-off error even on coarse grids. Furthermore, HOPE maintains the Rossby-Haurwitz wave over 100 days without collapse. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case, the WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>
