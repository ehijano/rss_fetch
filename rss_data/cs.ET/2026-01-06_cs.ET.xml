      <title>Analog Weight Update Rule in Ferroelectric Hafnia, using pico-Joule Programming Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to compete with the brain's efficiency at processing information, neuromorphic hardware combines artificial synapses and neurons using mixed-signal circuits and emerging memories. In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $\mu$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</description>

      <title>Bridging Language Gaps: Utilizing Interactive Robots to Teach Cantonese in Real-Life Contexts for Newly-Arrived Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong Kong's education system is notably multicultural, including local, non-Chinese-speaking, and newly arrived students (NAS) (Mandarine Chinese-speaking). NAS can guess the meaning of vocabulary but cannot speak out, presenting unique challenges for them, particularly language barriers and cultural differences. These challenges hinder their academic success and social integration, leading to feelings of isolation and demotivation. Current resources often fail to address the emotional well-being of these students and predominantly focus on English language acquisition, leaving a gap in support for learning Cantonese and navigating the local cultural landscape. This study explores the effectiveness of an interactive robot, Boon Boon, in teaching Cantonese through real-life contexts to enhance NAS children learning engagement and motivation. The research questions are: (1) How does interactive robot-empowered scenario learning influence the learning engagement and motivation of NAS in learning Cantonese? and (2) What is the impact of a robot-empowered scenario learning system on the Cantonese language proficiency of NAS? Fourteen children are invited to participate in a four-day learning program with Boon Boon. The preliminary result indicated that Boon Boon drove students' attention to learning and academic achievement. Future research will focus on long-term assessments of robot-empowered learning's effectiveness and explore the scalability of this approach across diverse educational settings and cultural backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Tuning of the Unscented Kalman Filter using Particle Swarm Optimization for Inertial-GPS Sensor Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vehicle positioning requires effective IMU-GPS fusion, yet prior methods-EKF, UKF, ML, GA, and DE-suffer from nonlinearity, instability, or high computational cost. This study introduces a PSO-based adaptive tuning framework for optimizing UKF parameters ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, \k{appa}, Q, R), evaluated in CARLA 0.9.14 using a Tesla Model 3 under diverse maneuvers and environmental conditions. Within defined parameter bounds, convergence stabilized within 15 generations, achieving an 82.14% accuracy improvement over manual tuning and reducing IMU drift by up to 21,606.59m. Multi-trial statistical validation confirmed consistent gains with low confidence intervals. With update times remaining below the 10 ms real-time threshold, the PSO-tuned UKF demonstrates practical localization performance for dynamic, GPS-challenged conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Recurrent Back-Projection Network for Tunnel Propagation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of radio wave propagation in railway tunnels is is critical for ensuring reliable communication-based train control (CBTC) systems. Fine-grid parabolic wave equation (PWE) solvers provide high-fidelity field predictions but are computationally expensive for large-scale tunnels, whereas coarse-grid models lose essential modal and geometric details. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed recurrent back-projection propagation network (PRBPN) that reconstructs fine-resolution received-signal-strength (RSS) fields from coarse PWE slices. The network integrates multi-slice temporal fusion with an iterative projection/back-projection mechanism that enforces physical consistency and avoids any pre-upsampling stage, resulting in strong data efficiency and improved generalization. Simulations across four tunnel cross-section geometries and four frequencies show that the proposed PRBPN closely tracks fine-mesh PWE references. Engineering-level validation on the Massif Central tunnel in France further confirms robustness in data-scarce scenarios, trained with only a few paired coarse/fine RSS. These results indicate that the proposed PRBPN can substantially reduce reliance on computationally intensive fine-grid solvers while maintaining high-fidelity tunnel propagation predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spatial Proximity on Drone Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the peer-to-peer impact of drones flying in close proximity. Understanding these impacts is crucial for planning efficient drone delivery services. In this regard, we conducted a set of experiments using drones at varying positions in a 3D space under different wind conditions. We collected data on drone energy consumption traveling in a skyway segment. We developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that plots drone trajectories within a segment. The GUI facilitates analyzing the peer-to-peer influence of drones on their energy consumption. The analysis includes drones' positions, distance of separation, and wind impact.</description>

      <title>Modeling Inter-drone Interference as a Service in Skyway Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel investigation into the impact of inter-drone interference on delivery efficiencies within multi-drone skyway networks. We conduct controlled experiments to analyze the behavior of drones in an indoor testbed environment. Our study compares performance between solo flights and concurrent multi-drone operations along predefined routes. This analysis captures interference occurring during both flight and at charging stations, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its effects on overall network performance. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments across diverse scenarios to systematically understand and model the dynamics of inter-drone interference. Key metrics, such as power consumption and delivery times, are considered. This generates a comprehensive dataset for in-depth analysis of interference at both the node and segment levels. These findings are then formalized into a predictive model. The results validate the effectiveness of the developed model, demonstrating its potential to accurately forecast inter-drone interferences.</description>

      <title>Device-Native Autonomous Agents for Privacy-Preserving Negotiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Orchestration of Multi-LLM Agents for Cost-Aware Sequential Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous decision agents in settings with asymmetric error costs: hiring (missed talent vs wasted interviews), medical triage (missed emergencies vs unnecessary escalation), and fraud detection (approved fraud vs declined legitimate payments). The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds "confidence," and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points). Ablations attribute 51 percent of savings to multi-LLM aggregation, 43 percent to sequential updating, and 20 percent to disagreement-triggered information gathering, consistent with the theoretical benefits of correct probabilistic foundations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Interface between Error and Erasure Correction in Wireless Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern 5G communication systems implement a combination of error correction and feedback-based erasure correction (HARQ/ARQ) as reliability mechanisms, which can introduce substantial delay and resource inefficiency. We propose forward erasure correction using network coding as a more delay-efficient alternative. We present a mathematical characterization of network delay for existing reliability mechanisms and network coding. Through simulations in a network slicing environment, we demonstrate that network coding not only improves the in-order delivery delay and goodput for the applications utilizing the slice, but also benefits other applications sharing the network by reducing resource utilization for the coded slice. Our analysis and characterization point towards ideas that require attention in the 6G standardization process. These findings highlight the need for greater modularity in protocol stack design that enables the integration of novel technologies in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Object Detection with Privileged Information: A Model-Agnostic Teacher-Student Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>PauliEngine: High-Performant Symbolic Arithmetic for Quantum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is inherently hybrid, and fast classical manipulation of qubit operators is necessary to ensure scalability in quantum software. We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations.</description>
