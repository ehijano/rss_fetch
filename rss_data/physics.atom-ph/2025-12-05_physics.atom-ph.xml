      <title>Continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity with Rydberg state wave-function engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending optical nonlinearity into the extremely weak light regime is at the heart of quantum optics, since it enables the efficient generation of photonic entanglement and implementation of photonic quantum logic gate. Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to ~ 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>QED nuclear recoil effect in helium isotope shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the leading-order $m\alpha^5$ QED correction with inclusion of the finite-nuclear-mass effects. Previously, this correction had been calculated within an expansion in the electron-nucleus mass ratio $m/M$ up to the first order. In this work, we derive formulas for the $m\alpha^5$ QED contribution that are valid up to the second order in $m/M$, and perform its calculation for the $^3$He$-$$^4$He isotope shift, leading to an improved determination of the nuclear charge-radius difference.</description>

      <title>The Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) for H(3s) Ionization in the First-Born Approximation by Electron and Positron Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical study was conducted on the impact of electron and positron impact ionization of excited hydrogen atoms that were in the 3s state; this study was conducted within the First-Born Approximation (FBA), which provides an analytical expression for the transition matrix in terms of the Bethe-Lewis Integral Formalism. This formalism utilized both Coulomb continuum and confluent hypergeometric functions to describe the scattering states involved. Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model. The results of this work can be used as benchmarking for the development of more complex distorted wave and multi-scattering theories in excited state ionization processes.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shift Mitigation in a Chip-Scale Atomic Beam Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-scale microwave atomic systems based on thermal atomic beams offer a promising approach to realize low-power and low-drift clocks for timing holdover applications. Miniature beam clocks are expected to suppress many of the shifts that commonly limit existing chip-scale atomic clocks based on coherent population trapping, including collisional shifts and some light shifts. However, the beam geometry can amplify some challenges such as Doppler shifts, which generate a strong sensitivity to laser frequency variation. Using a cm-scale 87Rb atom beam clock, we identify a surprisingly strong competition between Doppler shifts and resonant light shifts arising from asym- metric decay in the clock spectroscopy {\Lambda}-system. Leveraging this competition between Doppler and resonant light shifts, we demonstrate clock operation at specific, convenient experimental pa- rameters consistent with zero sensitivity to laser frequency variation and white-noise-limited clock frequency averaging for 1000 s of integration.</description>

      <title>First observation and measurement of the ${}^{198}\text{Hg}$ bosonic transition in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of the magnetic-field-induced (5d10 6s2)1S0-(5d10 6s6p)3P0 transition in a bosonic isotope of mercury, 198Hg, realized in an optical lattice clock. We characterize this new isotope, determining key features such as the quadratic Zeeman shift, the probe light shift, and the magic frequency. We also report a first comparison between the 198Hg optical lattice clock and 87Sr. In this comparison, the 198Hg clock has a relative frequency stability of 6x10-16/sqrt(tau/s) and a total relative systematic uncertainty of 6.9x10-16. This comparison yields the first direct determination of the 198Hg/87Sr optical frequency ratio: 198Hg/87Sr = 2.629 315 734 684 118 1, with the same relative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Exploring vibronic dynamics near a sloped conical intersection with trapped Rydberg ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin-phonon coupled dynamics in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection created by laser coupling the electronic (spin) and vibrational degrees of freedom of a pair of trapped Rydberg ions. We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle pulse control of holographic and non-holographic electron interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of sub-cycle laser pulses on holographic and non-holographic intracycle interferences by analyzing the photoelectron momentum distributions of helium using TDSE simulations supported by classical trajectory calculations. The results show that the forward-scattering holographic (FSH), backward-scattering holographic (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) structures are found to be highly sensitive to the pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope in the sub-cycle regime. Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times. These results demonstrate that sub-cycle pulses enable precise temporal control of holographic interference, offering new opportunities for probing and manipulating attosecond electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>A Platform for Evanescently Trapping Rb-87 Using Silicon Nitride Strip Waveguides Buried in Silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>

      <title>Shell formation and two-dimensional nanofriction in three-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organized three-dimensional (3D) ion Coulomb crystals in linear Paul traps naturally form concentric shells that provide a curved, atomically resolved interface for studying two-dimensional (2D) nanofriction. Building on prior work that used 2D ion crystals to investigate one-dimensional (1D) nanofriction and orientational melting, we leverage this foundation to extend friction studies from linear ion chains and planar rings to 3D shell structures. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we first map shell formation as a function of ion number $N$ and the trapping aspect ratio, yielding a simple relation that can aid ion-number estimation in experiments. We compute a Peierls--Nabarro-type energy landscape for the rotation of the outer shell against the inner core, showing drastic changes in the effective energy barrier up to a factor of about 60 with only small changes in $N$. Using dynamical simulations, we apply rotational torques to the outer shell of selected systems and show that small changes in $N$ impact the commensurability between shells and can, in some cases, induce a hysteretic response due to torque-induced metastable states. We find that spatially varying coupling to the inner-core corrugation can create coexisting fast and slow moving domains within the rotating outer shell, realizing multidimensional friction where intra-shell shear and inter-shell nanofriction act simultaneously. Our results have implications for stabilizing many-body systems and for the development of ultra-low-friction nanomechanical devices such as ion-based nanorotors and torque sensors.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Beam Dynamics Simulation of the RF Photoinjector Test Bench at JINR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at JINR, aimed at producing high-quality electron beams and enabling future generation of relativistic vortex electrons. Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun under the presently available RF gradient of ~45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge forces are weak, and the transverse emittance is dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode-region solenoid yields a robust emittance-stabilization regime with a final normalized emittance of ~3.2 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating structured electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading and preserves the wave-packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>
