      <title>Efficient ensemble uncertainty estimation in Gaussian Processes Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty measures are required when using data based machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for atomistic simulations. In this work, we propose for sparse Gaussian Process Regression type MLIP a stochastic uncertainty measure akin to the query-by-committee approach often used in conjunction with neural network based MLIPs. The uncertainty measure is coined \textit{"label noise"} ensemble uncertainty as it emerges from adding noise to the energy labels in the training data. We find that this method of calculating an ensemble uncertainty is as well calibrated as the one obtained from the closed-form expression for the posterior variance when the sparse GPR is treated as a projected process. Comparing the two methods, our proposed ensemble uncertainty is, however, faster to evaluate than the closed-form expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty measure acts better to support a Bayesian search for optimal structure of Au$_{20}$ clusters.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional gas-fueled nuclear reactor with thermal feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a simplified one-dimensional subchannel of a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor operating with a gaseous core in steady-state conditions, reproducing a neutronic-thermal-fluid-dynamics coupled problem with thermal feedback. The fuel gas, consisting of a homogeneous mixture of uranium hexfluoride (\ce{UF_6}) and helium, is assumed to be ideal, with simplifications made to its thermodynamic state. Due to the high thermal expansion of the fuel, a possible interesting strong coupling is anticipated. The discrete ordinates' method is used to compute the one group scalar flux, the effective multiplication factor and the power released by the core. Six groups of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) are used to take into account the fuel motion drift. Compressible Euler equations are solved with a monolithic approach and the two-physics problem is treated with Picard iterations. As expected, the effective multiplication factor of a subchannel is shown to increase with the inlet pressure. The critical pressure, representing the threshold at which the system achieves criticality, changes as the fuel mixture changes. High thermal feedback coefficients are observed due to the high thermal expansion of the fuel. The amount of helium in the mixture greatly affects the temperature at core outlet in critical configurations. This study shows that a gaseous fuel reactor can be brought to criticality varying the inlet pressure. The thermal feedback is strong and should be taken into account in the design of the system.</description>

      <title>Multi evolutional deep neural networks (Multi-EDNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutional deep neural networks (EDNN) solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by marching the network representation of the solution fields, using the governing equations. Use of a single network to solve coupled PDEs on large domains requires a large number of network parameters and incurs a significant computational cost. We introduce coupled EDNN (C-EDNN) to solve systems of PDEs by using independent networks for each state variable, which are only coupled through the governing equations. We also introduce distributed EDNN (D-EDNN) by spatially partitioning the global domain into several elements and assigning individual EDNNs to each element to solve the local evolution of the PDE. The networks then exchange the solution and fluxes at their interfaces, similar to flux-reconstruction methods, and ensure that the PDE dynamics are accurately preserved between neighboring elements. Together C-EDNN and D-EDNN form the general class of Multi-EDNN methods. We demonstrate these methods with aid of canonical problems including linear advection, the heat equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in Couette and Taylor-Green flows.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of the Navier-slip boundary condition to arbitrary directions: Application to 3D oblique geodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although boundary conditions are mandatory to solve partial differential equations, they also represent a transfer of information between the domain being modelled and its surroundings. In the case of isolated or closed systems, these can be formulated using free- or no-slip conditions. However, for open systems, the information transferred through the boundaries is essential to the dynamics of the system and can have a first order impact on its evolution. This work addresses regional geodynamic modelling simulating the evolution of an Earth's piece over millions of years by solving non-linear Stokes flow. In this open system, we introduce a new approach to impose oblique boundary conditions generalising the Navier-slip boundary conditions to arbitrary directions in 3D. The method requires defining both slip and stress constraints. The stress constraint is imposed utilising a coordinate transformation to redefine the stress tensor along the boundaries according to the arbitrary direction chosen while for the slip constraint we utilise Nitsche's method in the context of the finite element method, resulting in a symmetrised and penalised weak form. We validate our approach through a series of numerical experiments of increasing complexity, starting with 2D and 3D linear models. Then, we apply those boundary conditions to a 3D non-linear geodynamic model of oblique extension that we compare with a standard model utilising Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our results show that using Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly influences the evolution of the system and generates artefacts near and along the boundaries. In comparison, the model using the generalised Navier-slip boundary conditions behaves closely to a model with an unbounded domain, providing a physically interpretable solution near and along the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary migration of a self-rewetting droplet on an inclined surface: A phase-field simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the thermocapillary migration of a self-rewetting droplet on an inclined surface using a phase field based lattice Boltzmann method. Unlike the normal fluid whose surface tension decreases linearly with temperature, the self-rewetting fluid consider in the current work has a quadratic temperature dependence of surface tension with a well-defined minimum. we first explored the influence of the Marangoni number on droplet migration, and found that the droplet hardly deforms and migrates slowly when the Marangoni number is small. However, as the Marangoni number increases, the droplet begins to deform and elongate, and its migration speed increases. Subsequently, we studied the effect of surface wettability on droplet migration. The results show that the droplet migrate towards regions of higher surface energy on hydrophilic surfaces and in the opposite direction on hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, by varying the viscosity ratio and the inclination angle of the plate, we found that the droplet's migration speed decreases with an increase in the viscosity ratio. In particular, two vortices appear inside the droplet at a high viscosity ratio, whereas only one vortex is present at a low viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete solitons in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the quasi-Riesz derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate a fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (FDNLS) equation based on an appropriately modified definition of the Riesz fractional derivative, which is characterized by its L\'{e}vy index (LI). This FDNLS equation represents a novel discrete system, in which the nearest-neighbor coupling is combined with long-range interactions, that decay as the inverse square of the separation between lattice sites. The system may be realized as an array of parallel quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of atoms or small molecules carrying, respectively, a permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment. The dispersion relation (DR) for lattice waves and the corresponding propagation band in the system's linear spectrum are found in an exact form for all values of LI. The DR is consistent with the continuum limit, differing in the range of wavenumbers. Formation of single-site and two-site discrete solitons is explored, starting from the anti-continuum limit and continuing the analysis in the numerical form up to the existence boundary of the discrete solitons. Stability of the solitons is identified in terms of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Mobility of the discrete solitons is considered too, by means of an estimate of the system's Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier, and with the help of direct simulations. Collisions between persistently moving discrete solitons are also studied.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reaction Barriers with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable states in complex systems correspond to local minima on the associated potential energy surface. Transitions between these local minima govern the dynamics of such systems. Precisely determining the transition pathways in complex and high-dimensional systems is challenging because these transitions are rare events, and isolating the relevant species in experiments is difficult. Most of the time, the system remains near a local minimum, with rare, large fluctuations leading to transitions between minima. The probability of such transitions decreases exponentially with the height of the energy barrier, making the system's dynamics highly sensitive to the calculated energy barriers. This work aims to formulate the problem of finding the minimum energy barrier between two stable states in the system's state space as a cost-minimization problem. We propose solving this problem using reinforcement learning algorithms. The exploratory nature of reinforcement learning agents enables efficient sampling and determination of the minimum energy barrier for transitions.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. The ray effect stands as a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests displaying the ray effect, we observe low regularity in velocity within the solution. To address this issue, we propose a random ordinate method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared with other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational cost is comparable to DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing code based on DOM; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. Analytical results are presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias, and numerical tests demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <title>Particle transport and deposition in wall-sheared thermal turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the transport and deposition behavior of point particles in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cells subjected to Couette-type wall shear. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for Rayleigh number (Ra) in the range \(10^7 \leq Ra \leq 10^9\) with a fixed Prandtl number \(Pr = 0.71\), while the wall-shear Reynolds number (\(Re_w\)) is in the range \(0 \leq Re_w \leq 12000\). With the increase of \(Re_w\), the large-scale rolls expanded horizontally, evolving into zonal flow in two-dimensional simulations or streamwise-oriented rolls in three-dimensional simulations. We observed that for particles with a small Stokes number St, they either circulated within the large-scale rolls when buoyancy dominated or drifted near the walls when shear dominated. For medium St particles, pronounced spatial inhomogeneity and preferential concentration were observed regardless of the prevailing flow state. For large St particles, the turbulent flow structure had a minor influence on particles' motion; although clustering still occurred, wall shear had a negligible influence compared to that for medium St particles. We then presented the settling curves to quantify the particle deposition ratio on the walls. Our DNS results aligned well with previous theoretical predictions, which state that small St particles settle with an exponential deposition ratio and large St particles settle with a linear deposition ratio. For medium St particles, where complex particles-turbulence interaction emerges, we developed a new model describing the settling process with an initial linear stage followed by a non-linear stage. Unknown parameters in our model can be determined either by fitting the settling curves or using empirical relations. Compared with DNS results, our model also accurately predicts the average residence time across a wide range of St for various \(Re_w\).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The software project kdotpy provides a Python application for simulating electronic band structures of semiconductor devices with $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory on a lattice. The application implements the widely used Kane model, capable of reliable predictions of transport and optical properties for a large variety of topological and non-topological materials with a zincblende crystal structure. The application automates the tedious steps of simulating band structures. The user inputs the relevant physical parameters on the command line, for example materials and dimensions of the device, magnetic field, and temperature. The program constructs the appropriate matrix Hamiltonian on a discretized lattice of spatial coordinates and diagonalizes it. The physical observables are extracted from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and saved as output. The program is highly customizable with a large set of configuration options and material parameters.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>
