      <title>Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Designing Planar Multilayer Photonic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are emerging tools in the design of functional materials due to their powerful solution space search capability. How to balance the high price of quantum computing resources and the growing computing needs has become an urgent problem to be solved. We propose a novel optimization strategy based on an active learning scheme that combines the improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with machine learning surrogate model regression. Using Random Forests as the surrogate model circumvents the time-consuming physical modeling or experiments, thereby improving the optimization efficiency. QGA, a genetic algorithm embedded with quantum mechanics, combines the advantages of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, enabling faster and more robust convergence to the optimum. Using the design of planar multilayer photonic structures for transparent radiative cooling as a testbed, we show superiority of our algorithm over the classical genetic algorithm (CGA). Additionally, we show the precision advantage of the RF model as a flexible surrogate model, which relaxes the constraints on the type of surrogate model that can be used in other quantum computing optimization algorithms (e.g., quantum annealing needs Ising model as a surrogate).</description>

      <title>Absolute zeta functions and periodicity of quantum walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, absolute zeta functions can be considered as zeta functions over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This study presents a connection between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions. In this paper, we focus on Hadamard walks and $3$-state Grover walks on cycle graphs. The Hadamard walks and the Grover walks are typical models of the quantum walks. We consider the periods and zeta functions of such quantum walks. Moreover, we derive the explicit forms of the absolute zeta functions of corresponding zeta functions. Also, it is shown that our zeta functions of quantum walks are absolute automorphic forms.</description>

      <title>Robust shallow shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust shadow estimation protocol for wide classes of shallow measurement circuits that mitigates noise as long as the effective measurement map is locally unitarily invariant. This is in practice an excellent approximation, encompassing for instance the case of ideal single-qubit Clifford gates composing the first circuit layer of an otherwise arbitrary circuit architecture and even non-Markovian, gate-dependent noise in the rest of the circuit. We argue that for approximately local noise the measurement channel has an efficient matrix-product (tensor-train) representation, and show how to estimate this directly from experimental data using tensor-network tools, eliminating the need for analytical or numeric calculations. We illustrate the relevance of our method with both numerics and proof-of-principle experiments on an IBM Q device. Numerically, we show that, while unmitigated shallow shadows with noisy circuits become more biased as the depth increases, robust ones become more accurate for relevant parameter regimes. Experimentally, we observe major bias reductions in two simple fidelity estimation tasks using 5-qubit circuits with up to 2 layers of entangling gates using the mitigated variant, of close to an order of magnitude for $10^4$ measurement shots, e.g. Under the practical constraints of current and near-term noisy quantum devices, our method maximally realizes the potential of shadow estimation with global rotations.</description>

      <title>Photonic quantum generative adversarial networks for classical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) first emerged, they marked a breakthrough in the field of classical machine learning. Researchers have since designed quantum versions of the algorithm, both for the generation of classical and quantum data, but most work so far has focused on qubit-based architectures. In this article, we focus on photonic quantum computing and present a quantum GAN based on linear optical circuits and Fock-space encoding for the generation of classical data. We explore the trainability and the performance of the model in a proof-of-concept image generation scenario. We then conduct an experiment where we train our quantum GAN on Quandela's photonic quantum processor Ascella.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining tensor network methods with the stabilizer formalism to address the challenges of simulating many-body quantum systems. By integrating these techniques, we enhance our ability to accurately model unitary dynamics while mitigating the exponential growth of entanglement encountered in classical simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through applications to random Clifford T-doped circuits and Random Clifford Floquet Dynamics. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and accelerating progress in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>Estimating Non-Stabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Iterative Clifford Circuit Renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to efficiently handle the dynamics of non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using an approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study a magic purification circuit, where a measurement-induced transition is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies-Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker-Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron's speed. Thermal radiation from the mirror reveals a zero-jerk condition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Secure Anonymous Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) enable Internet browsing in a way that prevents the accessed content from being traced back to the user. This allows a high level of privacy, protecting individuals from being tracked by advertisers or governments, for example. The Tor network, a prominent example of such a network, uses a layered encryption scheme to encapsulate data packets, using Tor nodes to obscure the routing process before the packets enter the public Internet. While Tor is capable of providing substantial privacy, its encryption relies on schemes, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman for distributing symmetric keys, which are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks and are currently in the process of being phased out.
  To overcome the threat, we propose a quantum-resistant alternative to RSA and Diffie-Hellman for distributing symmetric keys, namely, quantum key distribution (QKD). Standard QKD networks depend on trusted nodes to relay keys across long distances, however, reliance on trusted nodes in the quantum network does not meet the criteria necessary for establishing a Tor circuit in the ACN. We address this issue by developing a protocol and network architecture that integrates QKD without the need for trusted nodes, thus meeting the requirements of the Tor network and creating a quantum-secure anonymous communication network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every $m$-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an $m$-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Strong Dipole-Dipole Interactions via Enhanced Light-Matter Coupling in Composite Nanofiber Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of emitters with a composite waveguide formed from two parallel optical nanofibers in currently unexplored regimes of experimental importance for atomic gases or solid-state emitters. Using the exact dyadic Green's function we comprehensively investigate the coupling efficiency and the fiber-induced Lamb shift accounting for variations in emitter positions and fiber configurations. This reveals coupling efficiencies and Purcell factors that are enhanced considerably beyond those using a single fiber waveguide, and robustness in the figures of merit. We finally investigate resonant dipole-dipole interactions and the generation of entanglement between two emitters mediated through the composite waveguide under excitation. We show that the concurrence can be enhanced for two fiber systems, such that entanglement may be present even in cases where it is zero for a single fiber. All-fiber systems are simple in construction and benefit from a wealth of existing telecommunications technologies, whilst enjoying strong couplings to emitters and offering novel light-matter functionalities specific to slot waveguides.</description>

      <title>Arctic: A Field Programmable Quantum Array Scheduling Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in neutral atom quantum computers have positioned them as a valuable framework for quantum computing, largely due to their prolonged coherence times and capacity for high-fidelity gate operations. Recently, neutral atom computers have enabled coherent atom shuttling to facilitate long-range connectivity as a high-fidelity alternative to traditional gate-based methods. However, these inherent advantages are accompanied by novel constraints, making it challenging to create optimal movement schedules.
  In this study I present, to the best of my knowledge, the first compiler pass designed to optimize reconfigurable coupling in zoned neutral atom architectures, while adhering to the reconfigurability constraints of these systems. I approach qubit mapping and movement scheduling as a max-cut and layered cross-minimization problem while enhancing support for spatially complex algorithms through a novel "stacking" feature that balances the qubit array's spatial dimensions with algorithmic parallelism.
  I compare the method across various algorithms sourced from Supermarq and Qasmbench where the compiler pass represents the first exclusively movement-based technique to achieve compilation times consistently within seconds. Results also demonstrate that the approach reduces pulse counts by up to 5x and increases fidelity by up to 7x compared to existing methods on currently available technology.</description>

      <title>Holonomic swap and controlled-swap gates of neutral atoms via selective Rydberg pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holonomic quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for quantum computation due to its error resistance and the ability to perform universal quantum computations. Here, we propose a scheme for the rapid implementation of a holonomic swap gate in neutral atomic systems, based on the selective Rydberg pumping mechanism. By employing time-dependent soft control, we effectively mitigate the impact of off-resonant terms even at higher driving intensities compared to time-independent driving. This approach accelerates the synthesis of logic gates and passively reduces the decoherence effects. Furthermore, by introducing an additional atom and applying the appropriate driving field, our scheme can be directly extended to implement a three-qubit controlled-swap gate. This advancement makes it a valuable tool for quantum state preparation, quantum switches, and a variational quantum algorithm in neutral atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, quantum channels have been widely concerned, and many ways to quantify quantum channels have been proposed, which has led to the generation of many resource theories for quantum channels. We add strong monotonicity and convexity to the requirement of imaginarity measure of quantum channels to make the measure proper. We also introduce an alternative framework to simplify the process of verifying whether a quantifier is a proper measure. We present three imaginarity measures of quantum channels via on the robustness, the trace norm and entropy, respectively. Some properties are also given.</description>

      <title>Entanglement sharing across a damping-dephasing channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a fundamental information processing task whose implementation is key to quantum communication and modular quantum computing. Noise experienced by such communication and computing platforms occurs not only in the form of Pauli noise such as dephasing (sometimes called $T_2$) but also non-Pauli noise such as amplitude damping (sometimes called $T_1$). We initiate a study of practical and asymptotic distillation over what we call the joint damping-dephasing noise channel. In the practical setting, we propose a distillation scheme that completely isolates away the damping noise. In the asymptotic setting we derive lower bounds on the entanglement sharing capacities including the coherent and reverse coherent information. Like the protocol achieving the reverse coherent information, our scheme uses only backward classical communication. However, for realistic damping noise ($T_1 \neq 2T_2$) our strategy can exceed the reverse coherent strategy, which is the best known for pure damping. In the forward communication setting we numerically exceed the single-letter coherent information strategy by observing the channel displays non-additivity at the two-letter level. The work shows non-additivity can also be found in realistic noise models with magnitudes of non-additivity similar to those found in more idealized noise channels.</description>

      <title>Sharing Asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering with Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, both global and local classical randomness-assisted projective measurement protocols have been employed to share Bell nonlocality of an entangled state among multiple sequential parties. Unlike Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering exhibits distinct asymmetric characteristics and serves as the necessary quantum resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information tasks. In this work, we propose a projective measurement protocol and investigate the shareability of EPR steering with steering radius criterion theoretically and experimentally. Our results reveal that arbitrarily many independent parties can share one-way steerability using projective measurements, even when no shared randomness is available. Furthermore, by leveraging only local randomness, asymmetric two-way steerability can also be shared. Our work not only deepens the understanding of the role of projective measurements in sharing quantum correlations but also opens up a new avenue for reutilizing asymmetric quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>A novel gas sensing principle based on quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of a novel measurement scheme to detect small amounts of a gas species via the ground-state fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (dispersion forces) depending on the entire spectral properties of all objects.
  Here, we describe an experimental setup of optically trapped nanoparticles in a hollow-core fibre. We calculate the effects of the gases on the thermal motion of the nanoparticles and present a neural network-based method for reconstructing the gas concentrations. We present an example of one possible setup capable of detecting concentrations of CO2 down to 0.01 volume per cent with an accuracy of 1 ppm.
  Reliable detection of small concentrations of specific molecules in a gas is essential for numerous applications such as security and environmental monitoring, medical tests, and production processes. Unlike other measurement schemes, such as surface plasmons or functionalised surfaces, this allows for fast, continuous monitoring and using small sample quantities, without influencing the probe or the sensor system.</description>

      <title>Static Quantum Errors and Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State preparation that initializes quantum systems in a fiducial state and measurements to read outcomes after the evolution of quantum states, both essential elements in quantum information processing in general, may contain noise from which errors, in particular, referred to as static errors, may appear even with noise-free evolution. In this work, we consider noisy resources such as faulty manufacturing and improper maintenance of systems by which static errors in state preparation and measurement are inevitable. We show how to suppress static errors and purify noiseless SPAM by repeatedly applying noisy resources. We present the purification protocol for noisy initialization and noisy measurements and verify that a few qubits are immediately cost-effective to suppress error rates up to $10^{-3}$. We also demonstrate the purification protocol in a realistic scenario. The results are readily feasible with current quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Laser-assisted radiative recombination beyond the dipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive theoretical approach to describe the electron-ion radiative recombination in the presence of intense, short laser pulses, which accounts for nondipole corrections is presented. It is based on the relativistic Coulomb-Volkov solution describing an electron in a combined Coulomb potential and a laser field, which is systematically expanded in powers of $1/c$. Thus, it allows us to trace the origin of nondipole effects observed in the spectrum of emitted radiation. Hence, as we demonstrate for high-frequency pulses assisting the process, a significant extension of the cutoff and asymmetry in angular distributions of the emitted radiation can be attributed to the electron recoil off the laser pulse. In addition, we investigate a possibility of enhancing the efficiency of the generated high-energy radiation by chirping the pulse.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence of stochastic and Bohmian arrival times in time-of-flight experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent prediction [Com. Phys., 6, 195 (2023)] that time-of-flight experiments with ultracold atoms could test different interpretations of quantum mechanics, this work investigates the arrival times predicted by the stochastic interpretation, whereby quantum particles follow definite but non-deterministic and non-differentiable trajectories. The distribution of arrival times is obtained from a Fokker-Planck equation, and confirmed by direct simulation of trajectories. It is found to be in general different from the distribution predicted by the Bohmian interpretation, in which quantum particles follow definite deterministic and differentiable trajectories. This result suggests that trajectory-based interpretations of quantum mechanics could be experimentally discriminated.</description>

      <title>On solving Schroedingers equation with integrals over classical paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Schroedinger equation of quantum physics can be solved using the classical Hamilton-Jacobi action dynamics, extending a key result of Feynman applicable only to quadratic Lagrangians. This is made possible by two developments. The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical least action problem, in effect replacing in part the probabilistic setting by the non-uniqueness of solutions of the constrained problem. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create Dirac constraint forces, which lead to multiple path solutions. The second development is a spatial rescaling of clocks, specifically designed to achieve a general equivalence between Schroedinger and Hamilton-Jacobi representations. These developments leave the results of associated Feynman path integrals unchanged, but they can greatly simplify their computation as only classical paths need to be included in the integrals, and time-slicing is avoided altogether. They also suggest a smooth transition between physics across scales.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bell sampling: stabilizer state learning and quantum pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful measurement primitive that has recently attracted a lot of attention, and has proven to be a valuable tool in studying stabiliser states. Unfortunately, however, it is known that Bell sampling fails when used on qu\emph{d}its of dimension $d&gt;2$. In this paper, we explore and quantify the limitations of Bell sampling on qudits, and propose new quantum algorithms to circumvent the use of Bell sampling in solving two important problems: learning stabiliser states and providing pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits. More specifically, as our first result, we characterise the output distribution corresponding to Bell sampling on copies of a stabiliser state and show that the output can be uniformly random, and hence reveal no information. As our second result, for $d=p$ prime we devise a quantum algorithm to identify an unknown stabiliser state in $(\mathbb{C}^p)^{\otimes n}$ that uses $O(n)$ copies of the input state and runs in time $O(n^4)$. As our third result, we provide a quantum algorithm that efficiently distinguishes a Haar-random state from a state with non-negligible stabiliser fidelity. As a corollary, any Clifford circuit on qudits of dimension $d$ using $O(\log{n}/\log{d})$ auxiliary non-Clifford single-qudit gates cannot prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states.</description>

      <title>Madelung Mechanics and Superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single-particle Madelung mechanics, the single-particle quantum state $\Psi(\vec{x},t) = R(\vec{x},t) e^{iS(\vec{x},t)/\hbar}$ is interpreted as comprising an entire conserved fluid of classical point particles, with local density $R(\vec{x},t)^2$ and local momentum $\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{x},t)$ (where $R$ and $S$ are real). The Schr\"{o}dinger equation gives rise to the continuity equation for the fluid, and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for particles of the fluid, which includes a new density-dependent quantum potential energy term $Q(\vec{x},t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\vec{\nabla}R(\vec{x},t)}{R(\vec{x},t)}$, which is all that makes the fluid behavior nonclassical. In particular, the quantum potential can become negative and create a nonclassical boost in the kinetic energy. This boost is related to superoscillations in the wavefunction, where the local frequency of $\Psi$ exceeds its global band limit. Berry showed that for states of definite energy $E$, the regions of superoscillation are exactly the regions where $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$. For energy superposition states with band-limit $E_+$, the situation is slightly more complicated, and the bound is no longer $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$. However, the fluid model provides a definite local energy for each fluid particle which allows us to define a local band limit for superoscillation, and with this definition, all regions of superoscillation are again regions where $Q(\vec{x},t)&lt;0$ for general superpositions. Detailed examples are given which illustrate the role of the quantum potential and superoscillations in a range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Krylov-Subspace Method Based Linear Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the successful enhancement to the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm by Childs et al., who introduced the Fourier approach leveraging linear combinations of unitary operators, our research has identified non-trivial redundancies within this method. This finding points to a considerable potential for refinement. In this paper, we propose the quantum Krylov-subspace method (QKSM), which is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm, to mitigate such redundancies. By integrating QKSM as a subroutine, we introduce the quantum Krylov-subspace method based linear solver that not only reduces computational redundancy but also enhances efficiency and accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments, conducted on systems with dimensions up to $2^{10} \times 2^{10}$, have demonstrated a significant reduction in computational resources and have led to more precise approximations.</description>

      <title>Control of the von Neumann Entropy for an Open Two-Qubit System Using Coherent and Incoherent Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to developing an approach for manipulating the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho(t))$ of an open two-qubit system with coherent control and incoherent control inducing time-dependent decoherence rates. The following goals are considered: (a) minimizing or maximizing the final entropy $S(\rho(T))$; (b) steering $S(\rho(T))$ to a given target value; (c) steering $S(\rho(T))$ to a target value and satisfying the pointwise state constraint $S(\rho(t)) \leq \overline{S}$ for a given $\overline{S}$; (d) keeping $S(\rho(t))$ constant at a given time interval. Under the Markovian dynamics determined by a Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad type master equation, which contains coherent and incoherent controls, one- and two-step gradient projection methods and genetic algorithm have been adapted, taking into account the specifics of the objective functionals. The corresponding numerical results are provided and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics and its quantum counterpart are traditionally described with statistical ensembles. Canonical typicality has related statistical mechanics for a system to ensembles of global energy eigen- states of system and its environment analyzing their cardinality. We show that the canonical density for a system emerges from a maximally entangled global state of system and environment through relational complex time evolution between system and environment without the need to maximize the entropy or to count states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential for disruptive change in many sectors of industry, especially in materials science and optimization. In this paper, we describe how the Turbine Balancing Problem can be solved with quantum computing, which is the NP-hard optimization problem of analytically balancing rotor blades in a single plane as found in turbine assembly. Small yet relevant instances occur in industry, which makes the problem interesting for early quantum computing benchmarks. We model it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem and compare the performance of a classical rule-based heuristic and D-Wave Systems' Quantum Annealer Advantage_system4.1. In this case study, we use real-world as well as synthetic datasets and observe that the quantum hardware significantly improves an actively used heuristic's solution for small-scale problem instances with bare disk imbalance in terms of solution quality. Motivated by this performance gain, we subsequently design a quantum-inspired classical heuristic based on simulated annealing that achieves extremely good results on all given problem instances, essentially solving the optimization problem sufficiently well for all considered datasets, according to industrial requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Cabbolet argues that the PBR theorem is nonreal since in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics the entangled measurement used in the derivation of the PBR theorem is nonexisting. However, Cabbolet (1) doesn't provide any argument for the nonexistence of entangled measurements beyond the incompatibility of the existence of entangled measurements and the existence of $\psi$-epistemic models which we already know from the PBR theorem; and (2) he doesn't show why it is more reasonable to abandon entangled measurements instead of $\psi$-epistemic models. Hence, the PBR theorem remains intact.</description>

      <title>Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-platform verification is the task of comparing the output states produced by different physical platforms using solely local quantum operations and classical communication. While protocols have previously been suggested for this task, their exponential sample complexity renders them unpractical even for intermediate-scale quantum systems. In this work, we propose a novel protocol for this task based on Pauli sampling, a subroutine which generates Paulis distributed according to their weight in the expansion of a quantum state in the Pauli basis. We show that our protocols for both Pauli sampling and cross-platform verification are efficient for quantum states with low magic and entanglement (i.e., of the order $O(\log n)$). Conversely, we show super-polynomial lower bounds on the complexity of both tasks for states with $\omega(\log n)$ magic and entanglement. Interestingly, when considering states with real amplitudes the requirements of our protocol for cross-platform verification can be significantly weakened.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of Quantum Entanglement for Enhancing Precision in Frequency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strategies for reaching the ultimate limit on the precision of frequency estimation when the number of probes used in each run of the experiment is fixed. That limit is set by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB), which predicts that the use of maximally entangled probes enhances the estimation precision, when compared with the use of independent probes. However, the bound is only achievable if the statistical model used in the estimation remains identifiable throughout the procedure. This in turn sets different limits on the maximal sensing time used in each run of the estimation procedure, when entangled and independent probes are used. When those constraints are taken into account, one can show that, when the total number of probes and the total duration of the estimation process are counted as fixed resources, the use of entangled probes is, in fact, disadvantageous when compared with the use of independent probes. In order to counteract the limitations imposed on the sensing time by the requirement of identifiability of the statistical model, we propose a time-adaptive strategy, in which the sensing time is adequately increased at each step of the estimation process, calculate an attainable error bound for the strategy and discuss how to optimally choose its parameters in order to minimize that bound. We show that the proposed strategy leads to much better scaling of the estimation uncertainty with the total number of probes and the total sensing time than the traditional fixed-sensing-time strategy. We also show that, when the total number of probes and the total sensing time are counted as resources, independent probes and maximally entangled ones have now the same performance, in contrast to the non-adaptive strategy, where the use of independent is more advantageous than the use of maximally entangled ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states of light play a key role in modern quantum science, but creating hybrid quantum light-matter states remains a challenge. A promising basis for the creation of hybrid states is the interaction of free electrons with photons, which has so far been largely implemented without taking into account electron quantum recoil effects. We provide an analytical quantum electrodynamics-based framework for quantum optics with recoiled electrons and introduce a single recoil parameter $\sigma$. With this framework, we show how to generate photon and electron-photon Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and NOON states, coherent states, squeezed vacuum (including bright squeezed vacuum) and twin beams. We analyze the transition between these states and predict a new class of photon and electron-photon quantum states shaped with the photon recoil effect (recoil-induced shaping). These results have wide potential applications including quantum computing and communication with photons and free electrons, and open up a novel avenue for ultrafast electron microscopy and next-generation free-electron sources.</description>

      <title>Generation of multi-photon Fock states at telecommunication wavelength using picosecond pulsed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon Fock states have diverse applications such as optical quantum information processing. For the implementation of quantum information processing, it is desirable that Fock states be generated within the telecommunication wavelength band, particularly in the C-band (1530-1565 nm). This is because mature optical communication technologies can be leveraged for the transmission, manipulation, and detection. Additionally, to achieve high-speed quantum information processing, it is desirable for Fock states to be generated in short optical pulses, as this allows embedding lots of information in the time domain. In this paper, we report the first generation of picosecond pulsed multi-photon Fock states (single-photon and two-photon states) in the C-band with Wigner negativities, which are verified by pulsed homodyne tomography. In our experimental setup, we utilize a single-pixel superconducting nanostrip photon-number-resolving detector (SNSPD), which is expected to facilitate the high-rate generation of various quantum states. This capability stems from the high temporal resolution of SNSPDs (50 ps in our case) allowing us to increase the repetition frequency of pulsed light from the conventional MHz range to the GHz range, although in this experiment the repetition frequency is limited to 10 MHz due to the bandwidth of the homodyne detector. Consequently, our experimental setup is anticipated to serve as a prototype of a high-speed optical quantum state generator for ultrafast quantum information processing at telecommunication wavelength.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable Quantum Boltzmann Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-variable quantum Boltzmann machine (CVQBM) using a powerful energy-based neural network. It can be realized experimentally on a continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computer. We used a CV quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to prepare the essential thermal state and then designed the CVQBM to proficiently generate continuous probability distributions. We applied our method to both classical and quantum data. Using real-world classical data, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we generated probability distributions. For quantum data, we used the output of CV quantum circuits. We obtained high fidelity and low Kuller-Leibler (KL) divergence showing that our CVQBM learns distributions from given data well and generates data sampling from that distribution efficiently. We also discussed the experimental feasibility of our proposed CVQBM. Our method can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems by choosing an appropriate target distribution (corresponding to, e.g., SAR images, medical images, and risk management in finance). Moreover, our CVQBM is versatile and could be programmed to perform tasks beyond generation, such as anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Sensing force gradients with cavity optomechanics while evading backaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study force gradient sensing by a coherently driven mechanical resonator with phase-sensitive detection of motion via the two-tone backaction evading measurement of cavity optomechanics. The response of the cavity to two coherent pumps is solved by numerical integration of the classical equations of motion, showing an extended region of monotonic response. We use Floquet theory to model the fluctuations, which rise only slightly above that of the usual backaction evading measurement in the presence of the mechanical drive. Our analysis indicates that this sensing technique is advantageous for applications such as Atomic Force Microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of particles in dense matter using quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Faster entanglement production driven by quantum resonance in many-body rotors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resonance in the paradigmatic kicked rotor model is a purely quantum effect that ignores the state of underlying classical chaos. In this work, the effect of quantum resonance on entanglement generation in the $N$-interacting kicked rotors is studied. We show a compelling feature: entanglement growth is superlinear in time until the timescale $t^*$, beyond which the entanglement production slows down to a logarithmic profile with superimposed oscillations. Notably, we find that at resonance, the entanglement dynamics is independent of the kick strength of rotors, but depends solely on the interaction strength. By mapping positional interaction to momentum space and analytically calculating the linear entropy, we elucidate the underlying mechanism driving these distinct growth profiles. The analytical findings are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations performed for two- and three-interacting kicked rotors. Our results are amenable to an experimental realization on ultracold atom setup.</description>

Abstract: We construct the primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 108-element $\Sigma(36\times3)$ group. This is the first time a nonabelian crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ has been constructed for quantum simulation. The gauge link registers and necessary primitives -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the $\Sigma(36\times3)$ Fourier transform -- are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are sub-wavelength patterned layers for controlling waves in physical systems. In optics, meta-surfaces are created by materials with different dielectric constants and are capable of unconventional functionalities. We develop a deep-learning framework for Dirac-material metasurface design for controlling electronic waves. The metasurface is a configuration of circular graphene quantum dots, each created by an electric potential. Employing deep convolutional neural networks, we show that the original scattering wave can be reconstructed with fidelity over 95$\%$, suggesting the feasibility of Dirac electron holography. Additional applications such as plane wave generation, designing broadband, and multi-functionality graphene metasurface systems are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Power-law entanglement and Hilbert space fragmentation in non-reciprocal quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits utilizing measurement to evolve a quantum wave function offer a new and rich playground to engineer unconventional entanglement dynamics. Here we introduce a hybrid, non-reciprocal setup featuring a quantum circuit, whose updates are conditioned on the state of a classical dynamical agent. In our example the circuit is represented by a Majorana quantum chain controlled by a classical $N$-state Potts chain undergoing pair-flips. The local orientation of the classical spins controls whether randomly drawn local measurements on the quantum chain are allowed or not. This imposes a dynamical kinetic constraint on the entanglement growth, described by the transfer matrix of an $N$-colored loop model. It yields an equivalent description of the circuit by an $SU(N)$-symmetric Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian or by a kinetically constrained surface growth model for an $N$-component height field. For $N=2$, we find a diffusive growth of the half-chain entanglement towards a stationary profile $S(L)\sim L^{1/2}$ for $L$ sites. For $N\ge3$, the kinetic constraints impose Hilbert space fragmentation, yielding subdiffusive growth towards $S(L)\sim L^{0.57}$. This showcases how the control by a classical dynamical agent can enrich the entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits, paving a route toward novel entanglement dynamics in non-reciprocal hybrid circuit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in semiconductor quantum dot systems modeled by extended Hubbard model, focusing on the impact of potential energy variations and electron interactions within a four-site quantum dot spin chain. Our study explores local and pairwise entanglement across configurations with electron counts N=4 and N=6, under different potential energy settings. By adjusting the potential energy in specific dots and examining the entanglement across various interaction regimes, we identify significant variations in the ground states of quantum dots. Our results reveal that local potential modifications lead to notable redistributions of electron configurations, significantly affecting the entanglement properties. These changes are depicted in phase diagrams that show entanglement dependencies on interaction strengths and potential energy adjustments, highlighting complex entanglement dynamics and phase transitions triggered by inter-dot interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note expands on the recent proof \cite{ABKT} that the extremal domains for analytic content in two dimensions can only be disks and annuli. This result's unexpected implication for theoretical physics is that, for extremal domains, the analytic content is a measure of non-commutativity of the (multiplicative) adjoint operators $T, T^{\dag}$, where $T^{\dag} = \bar z$, and therefore of the quantum deformation parameter (``Planck's constant"). The annular solution (which includes the disk as a special case) is, in fact, a continuous family of solutions, corresponding to all possible positive values of the deformation parameter, consistent with the physical requirement that conformal invariance in two dimensions forbids the existence of a special length scale.</description>

      <title>QSpace - An open-source tensor library for Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the documentation for the tensor library QSpace (v4.0), a toolbox to exploit `quantum symmetry spaces' in tensor network states in the quantum many-body context. QSpace permits arbitrary combinations of symmetries including the abelian symmetries $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $U(1)$, as well as all non-abelian symmetries based on the semisimple classical Lie algebras: $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, or respectively, the special unitary group SU($n$), the odd orthogonal group SO($2n+1$), the symplectic group Sp($2n$), and the even orthogonal group SO($2n$). The code (C++ embedded via the MEX interface into Matlab) is available open source as of QSpace v4.0 at https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/ under the Apache 2.0 license.
  QSpace is designed as a bottom-up approach for non-abelian symmetries. It starts from the defining representation and the respective Lie algebra. By explicitly computing and tabulating generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors, QSpace is versatile in the type of operations that it can perform across all symmetries. At the level of an application, much of the symmetry-related details are hidden within the QSpace C++ core libraries. Hence when developing tensor network algorithms with QSpace, these can be coded (nearly) as if there are no symmetries at all, despite being able to fully exploit general non-abelian symmetries.</description>

      <title>Does quantum mechanics require "conspiracy"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states containing records of incompatible outcomes of quantum measurements are valid states in the tensor-product Hilbert space. Since they contain false records, they conflict with the Born rule and with our observations. I show that excluding them requires a fine-tuning to an extremely restricted subspace of the Hilbert space that seems "conspiratorial", in the sense that (1) it seems to depend on future events that involve records (including measurement settings) and on the dynamical law (normally thought to be independent of the initial conditions), and (2) it violates Statistical Independence, even when it is valid in the context of Bell's theorem. To solve the puzzle, I build a model in which, by changing the dynamical law, the same initial conditions can lead to different histories in which the validity of records is relative to the new dynamical law. This relative validity of the records may restore causality, but the initial conditions still must depend, at least partially, on the dynamical law. While violations of Statistical Independence are often seen as non-scientific, they turn out to be needed to ensure the validity of records and our own memories and, by this, of science itself. A Past Hypothesis is needed to ensure the existence of records and turns out to require violations of Statistical Independence. It is not excluded that its explanation, still unknown, ensures such violations in the way needed by local interpretations of quantum mechanics. I suggest that an as-yet unknown law or superselection rule may restrict the full tensor-product Hilbert space to the very special subspace required by the validity of records and the Past Hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Recently, handling of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS) sets, in higher dimensions has been given an increasing attention, both theoretically and experimentally. However, methods of their generation are diverse, not generally applicable in every dimension, and of exponential complexity. Therefore, we design a dimensional upscaling method, whose complexity does not scale with dimension. As a proof of principle we generate manageable-sized KS master sets in up to 27 dimensional spaces and show that well over 32 dimensions can be reached. From these master sets we obtain an ample number of smaller KS sets. We discuss three kinds of applications that work with KS sets in higher dimensions. We anticipate other applications of KS sets for quantum information processing that make use of large families of nonisomorphic KS sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have applied a machine learning algorithm to predict the emergence of environment-induced spontaneous synchronization between two qubits in an open system setting. In particular, we have considered three different models, encompassing global and local dissipation regimes, to describe the open system dynamics of the qubits. We have utilized the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm to estimate the long time synchronization behavior of the qubits only using the early time expectation values of qubit observables in these three distinct models. Our findings clearly demonstrate the possibility of determining the occurrence of different synchronization phenomena with high precision even at the early stages of the dynamics using a machine learning-based approach. Moreover, we show the robustness of our approach against potential measurement errors in experiments by considering random errors in qubit expectation values. We believe that the presented results can prove to be useful in experimental studies on the determination of quantum synchronization.</description>

Abstract: The surface code is a two-dimensional topological code with code parameters that scale optimally with the number of physical qubits, under the constraint of two-dimensional locality. In three spatial dimensions an analogous simple yet optimal code was not previously known. Here, we introduce a construction that takes as input a stabilizer code and produces as output a three-dimensional topological code with related code parameters. The output codes have the special structure of being topological defect networks formed by layers of surface code joined along one-dimensional junctions, with a maximum stabilizer check weight of six. When the input is a family of good low-density parity-check codes, the output is a three-dimensional topological code with optimal scaling code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier.</description>

Abstract: Junctions are fundamental elements that support qubit locomotion in two-dimensional ion trap arrays and enhance connectivity in emerging trapped-ion quantum computers. In surface ion traps they have typically been implemented by shaping radio frequency (RF) electrodes in a single plane to minimize the disturbance to the pseudopotential. However, this method introduces issues related to RF lead routing that can increase power dissipation and the likelihood of voltage breakdown. Here, we propose and simulate a novel two-layer junction design incorporating two perpendicularly rotoreflected (rotated, then reflected) linear ion traps. The traps are vertically separated, and create a trapping potential between their respective planes. The orthogonal orientation of the RF electrodes of each trap relative to the other provides perpendicular axes of confinement that can be used to realize transport in two dimensions. While this design introduces manufacturing and operating challenges, as now two separate structures have to be precisely positioned relative to each other in the vertical direction and optical access from the top is obscured, it obviates the need to route RF leads below the top surface of the trap and eliminates the pseudopotential bumps that occur in typical junctions. In this paper the stability of idealized ion transfer in the new configuration is demonstrated, both by solving the Mathieu equation analytically to identify the stable regions and by numerically modeling ion dynamics. Our novel junction layout has the potential to enhance the flexibility of microfabricated ion trap control to enable large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a variational manifold of simple tensor network states for the study of a family of constrained models that describe spin-1/2 systems as realized by Rydberg atom arrays. Our manifold permits analytical calculation via perturbative expansion of one- and two-point functions in arbitrary spatial dimensions and allows for efficient computation of the matrix elements required for variational energy minimization and variational time evolution in up to three dimensions. We apply this framework to the PXP model on the hypercubic lattice in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and show that, in each case, it exhibits quantum phase transitions breaking the sub-lattice symmetry in equilibrium, and hosts quantum many body scars out of equilibrium. We demonstrate that our variational ansatz qualitatively captures all these phenomena and predicts key quantities with an accuracy that increases with the dimensionality of the lattice, and conclude that our method can be interpreted as a generalization of mean-field theory to constrained spin models.</description>

      <title>Improving Continuous-variable Quantum Channels with Unitary Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant hurdle for quantum information and processing using bosonic systems is stochastic phase errors which occur as the photons propagate through a channel. These errors will reduce the purity of states passing through the channel and so reducing the channels capacity. We present a scheme of passive linear optical unitary averaging for protecting unknown Gaussian states transmitted through an optical channel. The scheme reduces the effect of phase noise on purity, squeezing and entanglement, thereby enhancing the channel via probabilistic error correcting protocol. The scheme is robust to loss and typically succeeds with high probability. We provide both numerical simulations and analytical approximations tailored for relevant parameters with the improvement of practical and current technology. We also show the asymptotic nature of the protocol, highlighting both current and future relevance.</description>

      <title>Reducing classical communication costs in multiplexed quantum repeaters using hardware-aware quasi-local policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will have nodes equipped with multiple quantum memories, allowing for multiplexing and entanglement distillation strategies in order to increase fidelities and reduce waiting times for end-to-end entanglement distribution. In this work, we introduce \textit{quasi-local} policies for multiplexed quantum repeater chains. In fully-local policies, nodes make decisions based only on knowledge of their own states. In our quasi-local policies, nodes have increased knowledge of the state of the repeater chain, but not necessarily full, global knowledge. Our policies exploit the observation that for most decisions the nodes have to make, they only need to have information about the connected region of the chain they belong to, and not the entire chain. In this way, we not only obtain improved performance over local policies, but we reduce the classical communication (CC) costs inherent to global-knowledge policies. Our policies also outperform the well-known and widely studied nested purification and doubling swapping policy in practically relevant parameter regimes. We also carefully examine the role of entanglement distillation. Via analytical and numerical results, we identify the parameter regimes in which distillation makes sense and is useful. In these regimes, we also address the question: "Should we distill before swapping, or vice versa?" Finally, to provide further practical guidance, we propose an experimental implementation of a multiplexing-based repeater chain, and experimentally demonstrate the key element, a high-dimensional biphoton frequency comb. We then evaluate the anticipated performance of our multiplexing-based policies in such a real-world network through simulation results for two concrete memory platforms, namely rare-earth ions and diamond vacancies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing key rates of QKD protocol by Coincidence Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) provides unconditional security; however, its practical implementations are susceptible to exploitable vulnerabilities. This investigation tackles the constraints in practical QKD implementations using weak coherent pulses. We improve on the conventional approach of using decoy pulses by integrating it with the coincidence detection (CD) protocol. Additionally, we introduce an easy-to-implement algorithm to compute asymptotic key rates for the protocol. Furthermore, we have carried out an experimental implementation of the protocol, where we demonstrate that monitoring coincidences in the decoy state protocol leads to enhanced key rates under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature detection of quantum critical points via internal quantum teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the teleportation protocol can be efficiently used to detect quantum critical points using finite temperature data even if all resources needed to its implementation lie within the system under investigation. Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here, we use a pair of nearest neighbor spins from an infinite spin-1/2 chain in equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as the input state to be teleported. For several spin chain models subjected to an external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a clear indication of a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum to Classical Neural Network Transfer Learning Applied to Drug Toxicity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toxicity is a roadblock that prevents an inordinate number of drugs from being used in potentially life-saving applications. Deep learning provides a promising solution to finding ideal drug candidates; however, the vastness of chemical space coupled with the underlying $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ matrix multiplication means these efforts quickly become computationally demanding. To remedy this, we present a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for predicting drug toxicity, utilizing a quantum circuit design that mimics classical neural behavior by explicitly calculating matrix products with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Leveraging the Hadamard test for efficient inner product estimation rather than the conventionally used swap test, we reduce the number qubits by half and remove the need for quantum phase estimation. Directly computing matrix products quantum mechanically allows for learnable weights to be transferred from a quantum to a classical device for further training. We apply our framework to the Tox21 dataset and show that it achieves commensurate predictive accuracy to the model's fully classical $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ analog. Additionally, we demonstrate the model continues to learn, without disruption, once transferred to a fully classical architecture. We believe combining the quantum advantage of reduced complexity and the classical advantage of noise-free calculation will pave the way to more scalable machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a deterministic search algorithm on complete bipartite graphs. Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. We address the most general case of multiple marked states, so there is a problem of estimating the number of marked states. To this end, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model. We achieve simulation in constant time, that is, the complexity of the quantum circuit does not scale with the evolution time.</description>

      <title>A resource-efficient variational quantum algorithm for mRNA codon optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the mRNA codon has an essential impact on gene expression for a specific target protein. It is an NP-hard problem; thus, exact solutions to such optimization problems become computationally intractable for realistic problem sizes on both classical and quantum computers. However, approximate solutions via heuristics can substantially impact the application they enable. Quantum approximate optimization is an alternative computation paradigm promising for tackling such problems. Recently, there has been some research in quantum algorithms for bioinformatics, specifically for mRNA codon optimization. This research presents a denser way to encode codons for implementing mRNA codon optimization via the variational quantum eigensolver algorithms on a gate-based quantum computer. This reduces the qubit requirement by half compared to the existing quantum approach, thus allowing longer sequences to be executed on existing quantum processors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results to exact solutions, showing well-matching results.</description>

      <title>Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries and serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi entropy accumulation theorem and generalized quantum probability estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of R\'enyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-R\'enyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or $f$-weighted R\'enyi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig- Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional NHSE or NHSE at both edges and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-time dynamics of quantum systems, typically, but not always, results in a thermal steady state. The microscopic processes that lead to or circumvent this fate are of interest, since everyday experience tells us that not all spatial regions of a system heat up or cool down uniformly. This motivates the question: under what conditions can one slow down or completely arrest thermalization locally? Is it possible to construct realistic Hamiltonians and initial states such that a local region is effectively insulated from the rest, or acts like a barrier between two or more regions? We answer this in the affirmative by outlining the conditions that govern the flow of energy and entropy between subsystems. Using these ideas we provide a representative example for how simple few-body states can be used to engineer a ``thermal switch" between interacting regions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a protocol for the scalable quantum simulation of SU($N$)$\times$U(1) lattice gauge theories with alkaline-earth like atoms in optical lattices in both one- and two-dimensional systems. The protocol exploits the combination of naturally occurring SU($N$) pseudo-spin symmetry and strong inter-orbital interactions that is unique to such atomic species. A detailed ab initio study of the microscopic dynamics shows how gauge invariance emerges in an accessible parameter regime, and allows us to identify the main challenges in the simulation of such theories. We provide quantitative results about the requirements in terms of experimental stability in relation to observing gauge invariant dynamics, a key element for a deeper analysis on the functioning of such class of theories in both quantum simulators and computers.</description>

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider's high luminosity era presents major computational challenges in the analysis of collision events. Large amounts of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation will be required to constrain the statistical uncertainties of the simulated datasets below these of the experimental data.

      <description>arXiv:2312.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct proportionality, is associated with the gravitational wave memory effect under the conventional settings of interferometer parameters. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background (SGWMB), contributes not only to the classical red noise spectrum but also to a quantum red noise spectrum through this new mechanism. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers, which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic objects and gravitation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Chiral Symmetry and Symmetry-Class Conversion in Floquet Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$ quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: ETH and Equilibration in a Free Fermion Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the derivation of irreversibility in classical systems mostly relies on certain randomness. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the justification of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) in the large-deviation form.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase of Higher Dimensional Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of generating Floquet-time crystals in higher dimensions ($d\geq 2$) through the time-periodic driving of integrable free-fermionic models. The realization leads to rigid time-crystal phases that are ideally resistant to thermalization and decoherence. By utilizing spin-orbit coupling, we are able to realize a robust time-crystal phase that can be detected using novel techniques. Moreover, we discuss the significance of studying the highly persistent subharmonic responses and their implementation in a Kitaev spin liquid, which contributes to our understanding of time translational symmetry breaking and its practical implications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>An Imprecise Maxwell's Demon with Feedback Delay: An Exactly Solvable Information Engine Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite cycle time information engine based on a two-level system in contact with a thermal reservoir is studied analytically. The model for the engine incorporates an error in measuring the system's state and time delay between the measurement and the feedback process. The efficiency and power of the engine in steady state are derived as a function of level spacing, feedback delay time, engine cycle time, and measurement error. For a fixed value of level spacing and feedback delay, there is an upper bound on measurement error such that the engine can extract positive work. This threshold value of error is found to be independent of the cycle time. For a range of values of level spacing and feedback delay time, efficiency has a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement error, implying that there is an optimal measurement error for the information engine to operate efficiently. At high temperatures and with precise measurement, the engine's ability to extract positive work is extended over a larger range of feedback delay time.</description>
