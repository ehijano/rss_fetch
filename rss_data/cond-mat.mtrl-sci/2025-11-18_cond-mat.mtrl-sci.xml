      <title>Transition from MOS to Ideal Capacitor Behavior Triggered by Tunneling in the Inversion Population Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical solution to the nonlinear Poisson equation governing the inversion layer in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has recently been obtained, resolving a fundamental challenge in semiconductor theory first identified in 1955. This breakthrough enables the derivation of explicit expressions for relevant physical quantities, such as the inversion-layer width, electric potential, and charge distribution, as functions of gate voltage $V_G$, distance from oxide-semiconductor interface and impurity concentration. These quantities exhibit rapid variation during early-stage inversion but saturate once the gate voltage exceeds the threshold voltage by a few tenths of a volt signaling a transition in the MOS response to $V_G$. The onset of tunneling through the Esaki barrier leads to increased charge accumulation near the interface, reshaping the charge distribution into a two-dimensional profile and shifting the potential drop from the semiconductor to the oxide layer. This reconfiguration resembles the behavior of an ideal parallel-plate capacitor, with charge confined at the interface and the voltage drop localized across the oxide. We analyze this mechanism in detail and demonstrate, through explicit calculations, that the tunneling current through the Esaki-like barrier formed during inversion becomes dominant, effectively superseding classical inversion behavior. These results offer a new analytical foundation for quantum-aware device modeling and inform the design of next-generation MOSFET and tunneling FET architectures.</description>

      <title>Edwards Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.</description>

      <title>Layer breathing Raman mode in two-dimensional van der Waals material $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials have emerged as key materials for next-generation magneto-electric and spintronic devices, where understanding the relationship between layer number, lattice dynamics, and magnetic interactions is very important. In this work, we report the observation of the layer breathing mode (LBM) in few-layer $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with thickness dependent electronic, magnetic and optical properties, using Raman spectroscopy, which serves as a direct fingerprint of interlayer coupling and lattice symmetry. Group-theoretical symmetry analysis confirms that the CGT falls under the non-polar category of layered material. The evolution of the LBM-frequency with increasing layer number (N) reveals a distinct softening trend, characteristic of weakening restoring forces in thicker flakes. By fitting the experimental Raman data using the Linear Chain Model (LCM), we quantitatively extract the interlayer force constant ($\mathrm{K_c}$), providing a measure of the vdW coupling strength between layers.</description>

      <title>Effects of Yttrium Doping on Oxygen Conductivity in Ba(Fe, Co, Zr, Y)O_{3-\delta} Cathode Materials for Proton Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) achieve high efficiency at reduced operating temperatures, but their performance is often limited by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. The BaCoFeZrY (BCFZY) perovskite family is a promising triple-conducting air-electrode material, yet the role of Y dopants in governing oxygen transport remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of Y content on oxygen conductivity in three compositions: BCFZ, BCFZY0.1, and BCFY. Oxygen conductivity was evaluated from the product of oxygen tracer diffusivity and oxygen defect concentration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine tracer diffusivity and migration energies, while defect concentrations were estimated from reference data. Y doping slightly decreases oxygen conductivity from BCFZ to BCFZY0.1, from 337 to 203 mS/cm at 500 C, with activation energies of 0.155 and 0.172 eV. BCFY shows much lower conductivity (99 mS/cm) and a higher activation energy of 0.261 eV. Computed conductivities are higher and more Arrhenius-like than experimental values, suggesting that microstructural features such as grain boundaries strongly limit oxygen transport in real materials. A series-circuit model combining bulk conductivity and fitted grain-boundary parameters provides semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. These results clarify the role of Y doping in oxygen transport and provide insight for optimizing cathode performance in PCFCs.</description>

      <title>Ionic Interdiffusion at Cathode-Solid-Electrolyte Interface: A Machine Learning-Assisted Multiscale Investigation and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future lithium-based batteries are expected to use solid electrolytes to achieve higher energy density and fast charge capabilities. The majority of solid electrolytes are thermodynamically unstable against layered oxide cathodes. Here, the stability of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode with Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) solid electrolyte is investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD). The propensity of ionic interdiffusion, formation of a passivation layer, and corresponding decay in cell performance is addressed using a continuum model. The large-scale MLMD simulations confirm that the LCO|LGPS interface permits interdiffusion of Co and other ionic species, leading to the formation and growth of a resistive interphase and dramatic capacity fade even in the first cycle. We then examine the literature evidence that incorporating a thin layer of LiNb0.5Ta0.5O3 (LNTO) between LCO and LGPS prevents the interdiffusion of ions. Atomistic simulations suggest that the substitution of Li in LNTO with Co is not thermodynamically favorable, which helps to minimize the ionic interdiffusion process. The stable Nb/Ta5+ states form a rigid metal-oxide framework, which consequently also prevents the substitution of Nb/Ta. However, continuum level analysis suggests that due to the higher mechanical stiffness of LNTO, interfacial delamination between the LCO and LNTO is possible, which can minimize the effectiveness of the protective layer. This paper suggests the need for the development of novel interlayers that balance low interdiffusion with low stiffness.</description>

      <title>Ba-substitution induced evolution of structural and magnetic properties of La2-xBaxCoIrO6 double perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Iridium-based oxides are the subject of great recent interest due to the non-conventional physics that may emerge from the strong spin-orbit coupling present in 5d ions. Here, we explore the coupling between Ir and Co in the La2-xBaxCoIrO6 perovskites (x = 0, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0), where the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the series are investigated by means of x-ray powder diffraction and magnetometry. The system's crystal structure evolves from the monoclinic P2_1/n to the triclinic I-1 space group as the Ba concentration increases. Measurements of magnetization revealed ferrimagnetic behavior in x = 0, 0.5 and 0.75 compounds, possibly resulting from antiferromagnetic coupling between Co2+/3+ and Ir4+. In contrast, for x = 1.0 a clear collinear antiferromagnetic character is observed for the Co2+ ions, resulting from the quenching of the Ir5+ magnetic moment. The evolution of the magnetic properties of the series is discussed in terms of the structural and electronic changes, as well as the spin-orbit coupling in Ir.</description>

      <title>Rapid Machine Learning-Driven Detection of Pesticides and Dyes Using Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensive use of pesticides and synthetic dyes poses critical threats to food safety, human health, and environmental sustainability, necessitating rapid and reliable detection methods. Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Atomic and Lattice Modeling Using Geometric Deep Learning for Crystal Structure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure optimization, which yields the relaxed structure (minimum-energy state), is essential for reliable materials property calculations, yet traditional ab initio approaches such as density-functional theory (DFT) are computationally intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged to alleviate this bottleneck but suffers from two major limitations: (i) existing models operate mainly on atoms, leaving lattice vectors implicit despite their critical role in structural optimization; and (ii) they often rely on multi-stage, non-end-to-end workflows that are prone to error accumulation. Here, we present E3Relax, an end-to-end equivariant graph neural network that maps an unrelaxed crystal directly to its relaxed structure. E3Relax promotes both atoms and lattice vectors to graph nodes endowed with dual scalar-vector features, enabling unified and symmetry-preserving modeling of atomic displacements and lattice deformations. A layer-wise supervision strategy forces every network depth to make a physically meaningful refinement, mimicking the incremental convergence of DFT while preserving a fully end-to-end pipeline. We evaluate E3Relax on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency. Through DFT validations, we show that the structures predicted by E3Relax are energetically favorable, making them suitable as high-quality initial configurations to accelerate DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Chemical Ordering in Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry and Phase Control in K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ via Self-Flux Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered delafossite-type magnetic materials, such as KCrSe$_2$, are promising platforms for studying magnetic systems and potential frustration on triangular lattices. Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the N\'{e}el temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.</description>

      <title>Chemical-space completeness: a new strategy for crystalline materials exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning has brought the long-standing goal of comprehensively understanding and exploring crystalline materials closer to reality. Yet, universal exploration across all elements remains hindered by the combinatorial explosion of possible chemical environments, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, within any finite set of elements, the diversity of short-range bonding types and local geometric motifs is inherently limited. Guided by this chemical intuition, we propose a chemical-system-centric strategy for crystalline materials exploration. In this framework, generative models are coupled with machine-learned force fields as fast energy evaluators, and both are iteratively refined in a closed-loop cycle of generation, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Using the Li-P-S ternary system as a case study, we show that this approach captures the diversity of local environments with minimal additional first-principles data while maintaining structural creativity, achieving closed-loop convergence toward chemical completeness within a bounded chemical space. We further demonstrate downstream applications, including phase-diagram construction, ionic-diffusivity screening, and electronic-structure prediction. Together, this strategy provides a systematic and data-efficient framework for modeling both atomistic and electronic structures within defined chemical spaces, bridging accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven discovery of crystalline materials with human-level creativity and first-principles fidelity.</description>

      <title>An Active Learning Interatomic Potential For Defect-Engineered CoCrFeMnNi High-Entropy Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional properties arising from a combination of thermodynamic, kinetic and structural factors and have found applications in numerous fields such as aerospace, energy, chemical industries, hydrogen storage, and ocean engineering. However, a large compositional space remains to be explored. Unlike conventional approaches, computational methods have shown accelerated discovery of novel alloys in a short time. However, the lack of interatomic potentials have posed a challenge in discovering new alloy compositions and property measurements. In the present work, we have developed a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained by Machine Learning based approach using the BFGS unconstrained optimization algorithm for the CoCrFeMnNi High-entropy alloy. Our training set consists of various defects induced configurations such as vacancies, dislocations and stacking-faults. An active learning scheme to re-train the potential was undertaken to dynamically to add training data upon encountering extrapolative configurations during non-equilibrium simulations. A thorough investigation of the error metrics, equation of state, uniaxial tensile deformation, nano-indentation and solid-liquid interface stability for this alloy was carried out, and it is seen that the MTP potential outperforms the popular Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential on physical properties prediction. The accuracy and high computational speed are discussed using scaling performance. The potential is prepared for public use by embedding it into the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) code.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Surface Stability and Chemical Reactivity of Aza-Triphenylene Monolayer under O$_2$ and H$_2$O Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental oxidation has a great impact in tuning the physical, chemical and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers which can affect their practical applications in nanoscale engineering devices under ambient conditions. aza-triphenylene is a recently synthesized 2D materials whose practcal applications have not been systematically studied yet. In this study, we report for the first time, the adsorption and dissociation of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules on the surface of 2D aza-triphenylene monolayer through first principles calculations in combination with climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method. The results indicates that both the O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules weakly interact over the monolayer surface with an adsorption energy -0.16 eV and -0.37 eV respectively. In contrast, both the molecules exhibit resistance for dissociation due to the formation of energy barriers. The transition path indicates that molecular oxygen experience two energy barriers (0.16 ev and 1.22 eV) before getting dissociated atomic oxygen. However, the dissociation of H$_2$O requires larger energy barrier (2.3 eV and 0.86 eV) due to breaking of covalent bonds and transfer of hydrogen. The strong chemical adsorption of atomic oxygen and H$^+$/OH$^-$ ions is due to the significant charge transfer from monolayer to the adsorbate as evidenced from the charge density difference and Bader charge analysis. Moreover, the dissociated configuration exhibit a larger band gap as compared to the pristine aza-triphenylene due to the strong hybridization between the p states of carbon and oxygen. our work predicts the robustness of azatriphylene monolayer against oxygen/water exposer thus ensuring their stability for device applications using these materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice Thermal Transport Beyond the Quasiparticle Approximation: Nontrivial Spectral Competition between Three- and Four-Phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation (QPA) for phonons in strongly anharmonic materials necessitates advanced first-principles frameworks for accurate lattice dynamics and thermal transport predictions. We develop a comprehensive beyond-quasiparticle approximation (BQPA) approach incorporating both three- (3ph) and four-phonon (4ph) interactions and apply it to investigate lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) in MgO, PbTe, and AgCl -- materials that span a broad spectrum of anharmonicity, from weak to severe anharmonic regimes with overdamped phonons. We reveal that while BQPA consistently increases $\kappa_{\rm L}$ relative to QPA due to phonon softening when considering only 3ph interactions, the inclusion of additional 4ph interactions hardens the phonon spectrum and suppresses this enhancement, bringing BQPA and QPA predictions into close agreement via subtle spectral competition effects across all three compounds. These findings highlight that accurate modeling of $\kappa_{\rm L}$ in strongly anharmonic materials requires treating both full phonon spectral function and higher-order anharmonicity on equal footing. Our work establishes a systematic framework for modeling thermal transport in systems with overdamped phonons and provides critical insights for materials design beyond the limits of conventional phonon transport theory.</description>

      <title>XPS Analysis of Surface Chemical Transformations in ZBLAN Glass under Thermal and Vibrational Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZBLAN glass is highly sensitive to thermal and mechanical stimuli, yet the associated surface chemical changes remain poorly understood. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing the dynamic responses of Pb under shock loading based on DFT-accuracy machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data \textcolor{black}{obtained} from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler \textcolor{black}{compounds} and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Variationally Consistent Framework for Finite-Strain Microelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Local indirect magnetoelectric coupling at twin walls in CaMnO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelastic twin walls in centrosymmetric perovskites can host emergent polar and magnetic properties forbidden in the bulk. We use density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and magnetic properties of ferroelastic domain walls in orthorhombic CaMnO$_3$, which belongs to the most common perovskite space group, $Pnma$. At the wall, the inherent inversion symmetry-breaking induces local polar distortions dependent on the wall geometry, which couple to the magnetic order through the octahedral distortions. Noncollinear calculations reveal enhanced out-of-plane magnetic moments on the Mn atoms and a local, finite magnetization confined to the wall. Strain fields across twin walls thus give rise to coexistence of polarization and magnetization as well as magnetoelectric response that is absent and symmetry-forbidden in bulk CaMnO$_3$. We propose that magnetoelectric coupling and coexisting polarization and magnetization can emerge at twin walls in bulk centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>First Principles study of Photocatalytic Water Splitting in BO Monolayer: Effect of Strain and Surface Functionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light element based two dimensional (2D) materials are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Boron oxide (BO) is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer which has yet to be thoroughly explored for its potential applications. In this article, using first principles calculations, we report, for the first time, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of a BO monolayer for water splitting under mechanical strain and surface modification with single- and double-atom decorations (C, N, Si, Ge, P, As). The pristine BO monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.8 eV with band edges spanning the water redox potentials, but its optical absorption lies in the UV region (~ 4.5 eV). Strain engineering tunes the band gap and band alignment with a minimal shifting in the optical absorption (~0.5 eV). Single atom decoration produces a metallic state for elements like N, P, As, and an insulating state for single C, Si, Ge with a partial shifting in optical absorption. In contrast, double atom decoration produces substantial band gap reduction, improved band alignment, a pronounced red-shift in optical absorption into the visible range (1.6 to 3.2 eV) thus satisfying the criteria for water splitting. The stability of all the adsorbed configurations was confirmed by negative formation energy and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest BO monolayer functionalization can improve photocatalytic efficiency, providing hydrogen generation insights.</description>

Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.</description>

      <title>Omics-scale polymer computational database transferable to real-world artificial intelligence applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.</description>

      <title>Predicting Grain Growth in Polycrystalline Materials Using Deep Learning Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking GNNs for OOD Materials Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MatUQ, a benchmark framework for evaluating graph neural networks (GNNs) on out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction with uncertainty quantification (UQ). MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties. These results provide practical insights for selecting reliable models under distribution shifts in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Optimization in Nominally Identical Manufacturing and Measuring Systems for High-Throughput Parallel Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a two-day workshop held in Washington, D.C. in May, 2025 that convened researchers, industry representatives, and government stakeholders to examine the current state and future directions of quantum diamond technologies. The workshop's goals were to assess the most promising use cases, to identify the key technical and structural challenges limiting adoption, and to chart potential pathways for aligning application needs with diamond material and device development. Through a series of technical presentations and open discussions, participants explored both near-term demonstrations and long-term infrastructure needs, highlighting the critical role of coordination between material suppliers, device engineers, and end users. The goal of this report is to distill those insights into a coherent set of cross-cutting themes, challenges, and strategic actions that can guide government, industry, and academic efforts to accelerate the maturation and commercialization of quantum diamond technologies.</description>

      <title>Preference Learning from Physics-Based Feedback: Tuning Language Models to Design BCC/B2 Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic qubits stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as platforms for qubits and quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching of Perpendicular Ferromagnets by Higher-order Spin-orbit Torque in Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets is a central challenge for spintronics applications, typically requiring explicit symmetry breaking. Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Direct Photochemical Patterning of Lithium Niobate Thin Films for Scalable Nonlinear Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate is one of the most sought-after materials for nanophotonic devices, including frequency converters, modulators, and quantum light sources. Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity at Quantum-Critical KTaO3 Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity at oxide interfaces has intrigued researchers for decades, yet the underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric quantum critical point dramatically enhances interfacial superconductivity in KTaO3. By precisely tuning KTaO3 to its quantum critical composition through 0.8% niobium doping, we achieve a near-doubling of the superconducting transition temperature, reaching 2.9 K. Remarkably, a dome-shaped carrier density dependence emerges exclusively at the quantum critical point, contrasting sharply with the linear scaling observed in undoped interfaces. Our findings establish ferroelectric quantum criticality as a powerful mechanism for enhancing superconductivity and provide compelling evidence for soft-phonon-mediated pairing in these systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs toward a realization of a solid-state Thorium-229 nuclear clock, we review the technology, basic physics motivation, and limitations of the present generation of atomic clocks. We then discuss prospects for a new generation of clocks based on an anomalous low-energy 8.4 eV nuclear transition in Th-229, with an extremely long lifetime of 641 seconds when doped into CaF crystals. To realize such solid-state nuclear clocks one must confront basic nuclear, AMO, and solid state physics questions. Key challenges are understanding and minimizing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening, associated with strains and electric field gradients due to both the Th dopants and intrinsic crystal defects.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbon embedded in h-BN lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-P\'erot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 {\Omega}, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Attosecond Control of Solid-State Harmonics by Optical Waveforms and Quantum Geometry Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>

      <title>Bilayer B80 Structure: High Stability and Experimental Support for Existence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental characterization of B80- via photoelectron spectroscopy stimulated renewed interest in exploring B80 clusters. Here, a D3h-symmetric B80 bilayer structure has been proposed using density functional theory calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the bilayer structure maintain its structural integrity up to 1400 K, indicating superior thermodynamic stability compared to previously known B80 configurations, including the B80 buckyball and volleyball-like structures. Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV. These findings support the potential existence of this bilayer configuration, and enrich the structural diversity of boron clusters, offering promising prospects for applications in nanoscale electronics.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial flat bands and quantum Hall crossovers in square-octagon lattice materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $\alpha$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in LaP2 with graphenelike phosphorus layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with graphene-like layers attract tremendous attention due to their electronic structures and superconducting properties. In this study, we synthesized LaP2 polycrystalline and observed a superconducting transition around 30 GPa. The critical temperature Tc increases monotonically with pressure, which is nearing saturation and reaches 7.8 K at 78 GPa. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Growth of Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films on Optical Fiber End Facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit significant advantages for active optical components such as light emitting diodes, solar cells and photodetectors due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Their nonlinear optical effects and other characteristics also make them suitable for integration into waveguide components, such as optical fibers, for applications like optical modulation. Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.</description>

      <title>Broad-band ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of YAlO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broad band (THz to UV) ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of the orthorhombic perovskite YAlO3. The ellipsometric measurements have been performed on YAlO3 crystals with three different surface cuts and for six high symmetry configurations of the crystal axes with respect to the plane of incidence of the photons. The obtained data are presented in terms of the Mueller Matrix elements N, C, and S and their features are analyzed and discussed with respect to the anisotropy of the dielectric response tensor. In particular, in the infrared range we have identified all 25 infrared active phonon modes that have been predicted from theoretical studies. We also discuss a negative refraction effect that naturally occurs in the vicinity of an anisotropic longitudinal-optical phonon. Moreover, we have determined the temperature dependence of the phonon parameters between 10 and 330 K. The dielectric response above the phonon range, from about 0.1 to 6.5 eV, is shown to be featureless and characteristic of an insulator with a large band gap above 6.5 eV and is well described by anisotropic Cauchy model.</description>

      <title>First-principles-inspired thermodynamic framework linking the condensed ground state to displacive ferroelectric phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by treating the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of various displacive ferroelectrics. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework offers a tractable and parameter-free quantitative basis for understanding and predicting phase transitions in a broad range of ferroelectric systems under diverse thermodynamic and external conditions, bridging microscopic modeling and device-level design.</description>

      <title>Physical scaling laws in dislocation microstructures and avalanches from dislocation dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanche-like plastic bursts in crystalline materials follow power law statistics, but the scaling exponents and cutoff parameters vary widely in the literature ($\alpha$ ranging from -1 to -2.2), hindering predictive modeling. Since distributions do not follow Gaussian behavior, the average of plastic kinetics is not correctly defined. Larger-scale models that rely on average behavior are therefore fundamentally flawed. We performed extensive 3D Dislocation Dynamics simulations of FCC Cu deformation across three orders of magnitude in dislocation density ($\rho = 5 \ 10^{10} \ \text{\`a} \ 2 \ 10^{12} \ \text{m}^{-2}$) under constant strain rates. Our results demonstrate that the power law exponent ($\alpha \approx $ -1.6 to -1.7 ) is invariant to both dislocation density and loading direction, resolving previous inconsistencies. However, dislocation density strongly controls the power law truncation scaling ($\Delta \gamma_{max} \propto \ b/\sqrt{\rho}$) and the distribution of avalanche triggering stresses. We quantify correlations between slip system activities and show how individual system contributions evolve with avalanche size. These findings reconcile experimental scatter in avalanche statistics and provide quantitative scaling laws for mesoscale-to-continuum plasticity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of excitonic Mott phases in the presence of a periodic potential and a non-local exciton-exciton interaction. The non-local interaction is treated in a mean-field approximation, while the local repulsion of the excitons is treated in a hopping expansion. The convergence of the latter is the criterion for the stability of the Mott phase with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations. This hybrid approach enables us to establish a phase diagram for a bosonic Mott to superfluid transition. Our results could be useful to interpret recent experiments on electron-hole crystals in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Highly polar groups and supramolecular order enable charge injection and long-range conductivity in organic materials without extended {\pi}-systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Both semiconductive and metallic behavior is observed in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials and is applied in a wide range of commercial devices. Despite their large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended {\pi}-system, formed by a double-digit number of conjugated sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended {\pi}-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on thin-film devices shows that the resulting transport band only becomes energetically accessible for charge injection from the contacts thanks to interfacial dipoles that shift the relevant molecular orbital levels by up to 2 eV. Long-range order in the form of fibrillar supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. While current densities are moderate, this work provides a compelling explanation for the existing body of knowledge on non-{\pi}-conjugated conductivity and suggests a new way to endow organic materials with conductivity.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic physical properties of flexible van der Waals semiconductor InSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Ab-Initio Based Tight-Binding Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic structure of solids can routinely be calculated by standard methods like density functional theory. However, in complicated situations like interfaces, grain boundaries or contact geometries one needs to resort to more simplified models of the electronic structure. Tight-binding models are using a reduced set of orbitals and aim to approximate the electronic structure by short range hopping processes. For example, maximally localized Wannier functions are often used for that purpose. However, their accuracy is limited by the need to disentangle the electronic bands. Here, we develop and investigate a different procedure to obtain tight-binding models inspired by machine-learning techniques. The model parameters are optimized in such a way as to reproduce ab-initio band structure data as accurately as possible using an as small as possible number of model parameters. The procedure is shown to result in models with smaller ranges and fewer orbitals than maximally localized Wannier functions but same or even better accuracy. We argue that such a procedure is more useful for automated construction of tight-binding models particularly for large-scale materials calculations.</description>

      <title>A route to fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal: electric-field annihilation of the bilayer bandgap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully-compensated ferrimagnet has garnered widespread attention due to its zero-net total magnetic moment and non-relativistic global spin splitting. In general, for a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, at least one spin channel should be gapped to ensure a zero-net total magnetic moment, which would lead to a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) semiconductor or half-metal, and appears to limit the existence of an FC-FIM metal. Here we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be achieved by electrically closing the gap of a bilayer system. Using two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor as building block, we examine both FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer couplings and distinguish unipolar magnetic semiconductor (UMS) and bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) monolayers. It is concluded that an electric field can annihilate the bilayer gap and realize the FC-FIM metal only when the interlayer coupling is AFM and the building block is a UMS. Our scheme for realizing an FC-FIM metal can be generalized to electrically tuned 2D spin-degenerate metal with spin-layer locking. Using first-principles calculations, we have validated our proposal by taking bilayer MnOF, bilayer $\mathrm{ScI_2}$ and monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ as examples. Our work offers an alternative route to realize the originally forbidden FC-FIM metal, paving the way for further exploration of FC-FIM metal.</description>

Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Oxidation and Scale Evolution of a Wrought Co/Ni-based Superalloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how protective oxide scales evolve over time is necessary for improving the long term resistance of superalloys. This work investigates the time-dependent oxidation behavior of an ingot-processable Co/Ni-based superalloy oxidized in air at $800~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20$, $100$, and $1000~\mathrm{h}$ . Mass-gain and white-light interferometry measurements quantified oxidation kinetics, surface roughness, and spallation, while high-resolution STEM-EDX characterized oxide morphology and nanoscale elemental partitioning. Atom probe tomography captured the key transition regions between the chromia and alumina scales, and X-ray diffraction was used to identify a gradual transition from NiO and (Ni,Co)-spinel phases to a compact, dual phase chromia and alumina-rich scale. The oxidation rate evolved from near-linear to parabolic behavior with time, consistent with diffusion-controlled growth once a continuous Cr$_2$O$_3$/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scale formed. These observations help link kinetics, structure and chemistry, showing how an originally porous spinel layer transforms into a dense, adherent chromia + alumina scale that provides long-term protection in wrought Co/Ni-based superalloys.</description>

      <title>Structural Relaxation in Simple Yield Stress Materials Influences Their Rheology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the internal structure of the material, and therefore the rheology, should not change over time. We explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and show that gradual structural relaxation of the material results in a small yet significant reduction in the dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings show that the yield stress is not merely a static material property but may be a function of the internal structure of the material.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen liquid-liquid transition from first principles and machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular-to-atomic liquid-liquid transition (LLT) in high-pressure hydrogen is a fundamental topic touching domains from planetary science to materials modeling. Yet, the nature of the LLT is still under debate. To resolve it, numerical simulations must cover length and time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. We overcome these size and time limitations by constructing a fast and accurate machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) built on the MACE neural network architecture. The MLIP is trained on Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional calculations and uses a modified loss function correcting for an energy bias in the molecular phase. Classical and path-integral molecular dynamics driven by this MLIP show that the LLT is always supercritical above the melting temperature. The position of the corresponding Widom line agrees with previous ab initio PBE calculations, which in contrast predicted a first-order LLT. According to our calculations, the crossover line becomes a first-order transition only inside the molecular crystal region. These results call for a reconsideration of the LLT picture previously drawn.</description>

Abstract: We review recent studies on quantum materials where transition-metal atoms give rise to $d$-bands typical of kagome metals. Using examples from several material families - AV$_3$Sb$_5$, FeGe, RV$_6$Sn$_6$, and LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ - we argue that $p$-bands contributed by elements beyond the kagome network also play a crucial role in the electronic instabilities, including the charge-density-waves and superconductivity in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime, and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. We predict experimentally accessible axion mass regimes where such triply resonant transitions can be realized with standard dielectric resonators. We propose an experiment for probing such interactions named DARK-ROSE.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiple defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing defects, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing defects, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing defects. We find that not only the excitation energy but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific defects, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Neutron Reflectometry by Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</description>
