      <title>On reconstruction from imaginary part for radiation solutions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^2$. We show that $\psi$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $Im(\psi)$ on an interval of a line $L$ lying in the exterior region. This result has holographic prototype in the recent work [Nair, Novikov, arXiv:2408.08326]. Some other curves for measurements instead of the lines $L$ are also considered. Applications to the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem and passive imaging are also indicated.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates for the linearized relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary and an ideal gas equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will provide a result on the relativistic Euler equations for an ideal gas equation of state and a physical vacuum boundary. More specifically, we will prove a priori estimates for the linearized system in weighted Sobolev spaces. Our focus will be on choosing the correct thermodynamic variables, developing a weighted book-keeping scheme, and then proving energy estimates for the linearized system.</description>

      <title>Convergence/divergence phenomena in the vanishing discount limit of Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of an equation of the form \begin{equation}\label{abs}\tag{*} G\big(x, D_x u,\lambda u(x)\big) = c_0\qquad\hbox{in $M$} \end{equation} on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$, where $G\in C(T^*M\times\mathbb{R})$ is convex and superlinear in the gradient variable, is globally Lipschitz but not monotone in the last argument, and $c_0$ is the critical constant associated with the Hamiltonian $H:=G(\cdot,\cdot,0)$. By assuming that $\partial_u G(\cdot,\cdot,0)$ satisfies a positivity condition of integral type on the Mather set of $H$, we prove that any equi-bounded family of solutions of \eqref{abs} uniformly converges to a distinguished critical solution $u_0$ as $\lambda \to 0^+$. We furthermore show that any other possible family of solutions uniformly diverges to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. We then look into the linear case $G(x,p,u):=a(x)u + H(x,p)$ and prove that the family $(u_\lambda)_{\lambda \in (0,\lambda_0)}$ of maximal solutions to \eqref{abs} is well defined and equi-bounded for $\lambda_0&gt;0$ small enough. When $a$ changes sign and enjoys a stronger localized positivity assumption, we show that equation \eqref{abs} does admit other solutions too, and that they all uniformly diverge to $-\infty$ as $\lambda \to 0^+$. This is the first time that converging and diverging families of solutions are shown to coexist in such a generality.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic speeds of spreading for the Lotka-Volterra system with strong competition in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic spreading behavior of solutions of the Lotka-Volterra system with strong competition in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Two types of initial conditions are proposed: (C1) two species initially occupy bounded domains; (C2) two species initially occupy the whole space separately. The spreading dynamics for (C1) (C2) is strongly depending on the speeds of traveling fronts of the scalar equations with no competition and the system. We give the asymptotic speeds of spreading for both (C1) (C2).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of small data solutions to the screened Vlasov Poisson(i.e. Vlasov-Yukawa) equation on ${\mathbb R}\times{\mathbb R}$ near vacuum. We show that for initial data small in Gevrey-2 regularity, the derivative of the density of order $n$ decays like $(t+1)^{-n-1}$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Regularity, Bifurcations, and Turbulence in Fluid Dynamics via Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for the study of regularity, bifurcations, and turbulence in fluid dynamics, leveraging the power of Sobolev and Besov function spaces. We delve into the detailed definitions, properties, and notations of these spaces, illustrating their relevance in the context of partial differential equations governing fluid flow. The work emphasizes the intricate connections between Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, highlighting their interplay in the analysis of fluid systems. We propose new regularity criteria for solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, based on the interaction of low and high-frequency modes in turbulent regimes. These criteria offer a novel perspective on the conditions under which singularities may form, providing critical insights into the structure of turbulent flows. The article further explores the applications of these function spaces to the analysis of bifurcations in fluid systems, offering a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that lead to complex flow phenomena such as turbulence. Through the development of rigorous theorems and proofs, the paper aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theory and practical fluid dynamics. In particular, the results contribute to ongoing efforts in solving the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem, a key challenge in the field, and have potential implications for the Millennium Prize Problem. The conclusion underscores the significance of these findings, offering a pathway for future research in the analysis of fluid behavior at both small and large scales.</description>

      <title>On the double critical Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on (no)existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions for the double critical Maxwell equation involving with the Hardy, Hardy-Sobolev, Sobolev critical exponents. The existence and noexistence of solutions completely depend on the power exponents and coefficients of equation. On one hand, based on the concentration-compactness ideas, applying the Nehari manifold and the mountain pass theorem, we prove the existence of the ground state solutions for the critical Maxwell equation for three different scenarios. On the other hand, for the case $\lambda&lt;0$ and $0\leq s_2&lt;s_1&lt;2$, which is a type open problem raised by Li and Lin. Draw support from a changed version of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality, we find that there exists a constant $\lambda^*$ which is a negative number having explicit expression, such that the problem has no nontrivial solution as the coefficient $\lambda&lt;\lambda^*$. Moreover, there exists a constant $\lambda^*&lt;\lambda^{**}&lt;0$ such that, as $\lambda^{**}&lt;\lambda&lt;0$, the equation has a nontrivial solution using truncation methods. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic behavior of solutions of equation as coefficient converges to zero for the all cases above.</description>

      <title>A blow up solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with a critical force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A forced solution $v$ of the Navier-Stokes equation in any open domain with no slip boundary condition is constructed. The scaling factor of the forcing term is the critical order $-2$. The velocity, which is smooth until its final blow up moment, is in the energy space through out. Since most physical forces from a point source in nature are regarded as order $-2$, such as Coulomb force, Yukawa force, this result indicates possible singularity formation under these kind of forces. The result also holds for some log subcritical forces or some forces in the standard critical space $L^\infty_t L^{3/2}_x$.</description>

      <title>Continuum of coupled Wasserstein gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of drift-diffusion PDEs for a potentially infinite number of incompressible phases, subject to a joint pointwise volume constraint. Our analysis is based on the interpretation as a collection of coupled Wasserstein gradient flows or, equivalently, as a gradient flow in the space of couplings under a `fibered' Wasserstein distance. We prove existence of weak solutions, long-time asymptotics, and stability with respect to the mass distribution of the phases, including the discrete to continuous limit. A key step is to establish convergence of the product of pressure gradient and density, jointly over the infinite number of phases. The underlying energy functional is the objective of entropy regularized optimal transport, which allows us to interpret the model as the relaxation of the classical Angenent-Haker-Tannenbaum (AHT) scheme to the entropic setting. However, in contrast to the AHT scheme's lack of convergence guarantees, the relaxed scheme is unconditionally convergent. We conclude with numerical illustrations of the main results.</description>

      <title>Second derivatives of solutions to the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new controls for the Leray solutions $u$ of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we estimate $u$, $\nabla u$, and $\nabla^2 u$ in suitable Lebesgue spaces $L^{\tilde r}_TL^r$, $r &lt;+ \infty$ with some constraints on $\tilde r&gt;0$. Our method is based on a Duhamel formula around a perturbed heat equation, allowing to thoroughly exploit the well-known energy estimates which balances the potential singularities. We also perform a new Bihari-LaSalle argument in this context. Eventually, we adapt our strategy to prove that $\sup_{t \in [0,T]} \int_{0}^t (t-s)^{-\theta} \|\nabla^k u(s,\cdot)\|_{L^r} ds&lt;+ \infty$, for all $\theta&lt; \frac{3-kr}{2r}$, $k \in [0,2]$, and $1&lt;r&lt;\frac{3}{k}$.</description>

      <title>Prandtl Equations and Related Boundary Layer Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book aims to present some recent results on Prandtl equations and MHD boundary layer equations.
  This book is essentially divided into two parts. Chapter 1 as the first part systematically surveys the results till 2020 on Prandtl equations and MHD boundary layer equations. Chapter 2 to 6 are the main part of the book, which presents the local and the global well-posedness of solutions to the Prandtl equations and MHD boundary layer equations. In detail, Chapter 2 is concerned with global well-posedness of solutions to the 2D Prandtl-Hartmann equations in an analytic framework. Chapter 3 investigates the local existence of solutions to the 2D Prandtl equations in a weighted Sobolev space. Chapter 4 studies the local well-posedness of solutions to the 2D mixed Prandtl equations in a Sobolev space without monotonicity and lower bound. Chapter 5 is concerned with global existence of solutions to the 2D magnetic Prandtl equations in the Prandtl-Hartmann regime. Chapter 6 proves the local existence of solutions to the 3D Prandtl equations with a special structure.
  Mathematicians and physicists who are interested in fluid dynamics will find this book helpful.</description>

      <title>Existence and Non-existence for Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange-driven growth (EDG) model describes the evolution of clusters through the exchange of single monomers between pairs of interacting clusters. The dynamics of this process are primarily influenced by the interaction kernel $K_{j,k}$. In this paper, the global existence of classical solutions to the EDG equations is established for non-negative, symmetric interaction kernels satisfying $K_{j,k} \leq C(j^{\mu}k^{\nu} + j^{\nu}k^{\mu}) $, where $\mu, \nu \leq 2$, $\mu + \nu \leq 3$, and $C&gt;0$, with a broader class of initial data. This result extends the previous existence results obtained by Esenturk [10], Schlichting [23], and Eichenberg \&amp; Schlichting [7].
  Furthermore, the local existence of classical solutions to the EDG equations is demonstrated for symmetric interaction kernels that satisfy $K_{j,k} \leq C j^{2} k^{2}$ with $C &gt; 0$, considering a broader class of initial data. In the intermediate regime $3 &lt; \mu + \nu \leq 4$, the occurrence of finite-time gelation is established for symmetric interaction kernels satisfying $C_{1}\left(j^{2}k^{\alpha}+j^{\alpha}k^{2}\right)\leq K_{j,k}\leq Cj^{2}k^{2}$, where $1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$, $C&gt;0$, and $C_{1} &gt; 0$, as conjectured in [10]. In this case, the non-existence of the global solutions is ensured by the occurrence of finite-time gelation. Finally, the occurrence of instantaneous gelation of the solutions to EDG equations for symmetric interaction kernels satisfying $K_{j,k}\geq C\left(j^{\beta}+k^{\beta}\right)$ ($\beta&gt;2, C&gt;0)$ is shown, which also implies the non-existence of solutions in this case.</description>

      <title>Nodal sets and continuity of eigenfunctions of Kre\u{\i}-Feller operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a compactly supported positive finite Borel measure on $\R^{d}$. Let $0&lt;\lambda_{1}\leq\lambda_{2}\leq\ldots$ be eigenvalues of the Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator $\Delta_{\mu}$. We prove that, on a bounded domain, the nodal set of a continuous $\lambda_{n}$-eigenfunction of a Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator divides the domain into at least 2 and at most $n+r-1$ subdomains, where $r$ is the multiplicity of $\lambda_{n}$. This work generalizes the nodal set theorem of the classical Laplace operator to Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operators on bounded domains. We also prove that on bounded domains on which the classical Green function exists, the eigenfunctions of a Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator are continuous.</description>

We prove the existence of a weak solution in $W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,p}(\Omega)$ and its behavior near $\partial \Omega$ which consequently gives the optimal Sobolev regularity. Moreover, we establish several H\"older and gradient H\"older regularity results for a more general class of quasilinear operators involving singular as well as regular nonlinearities. As an application, we obtain H\"older regularity of weak solutions to the singular problem up to the boundary, of course with different exponents depending on $\beta+\delta$. Further, we include uniqueness and non-existence results for weak solutions to the problem. We also include an a priori boundedness and H\"older regularity result for the singular equation with critical exponent perturbation.</description>

      <title>Duality for Evolutionary Equations with Applications to Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study evolutionary equations in exponentially weighted $\mathrm{L}^{2}$-spaces as introduced by Picard in 2009. First, for a given evolutionary equation, we explicitly describe the $\nu$-adjoint system, which turns out to describe a system backwards in time. We prove well-posedness for the $\nu$-adjoint system. We then apply the thus obtained duality to introduce and study notions of null-controllability for evolutionary equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a weak and mild solution of the following nonlinear parabolic problem involving the porous $p$-fractional Laplacian:
  \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \partial_t u+(-\Delta)^s_p(|u|^{m-1}u)=h(t,x,|u|^{m-1}u) &amp; \text{in} \; (0,T)\times \Omega,\\ u=0 &amp; \text{in} \; (0,T) \times \mathbb{R}^d\backslash \Omega, \\ u(0,\cdot)=u_0 &amp; \text{in} \; \Omega . \end{cases}\ \end{equation*} We also study further the the homogeneous case $h(u)=|u|^{q-1}u$ with $q&gt;0$. In particular we investigate global time existence, uniqueness, global behaviour of weak solutions and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space, which is an extension of the previous works \cite{fournier2014propagation,jabin2018quantitative}. We improve our previous results in \cite{feng2023quantitative} to the more general case that the vorticity may change sign, allowing the circulations to be in different orientations. We also extend the results of \cite{wang2024sharp} to the whole space to obtain the sharp local propagation of chaos in the high viscosity regime. Both results of convergence rates are global-in-time on any finite time horizon and optimal among existing literature, thanks to the careful estimates using the Grigor'yan parabolic maximum principle and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic nonassociative plasticity at finite strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-strain elastoplastic evolution in the nonassociative setting. The constitutive material model is formulated in variational terms and coupled with the quasistatic equilibrium system. We introduce measure-valued energetic solutions and prove their existence via a time discretization approach. The existence theory hinges on a suitable regularization of the dissipation term via a space-time mollification. Eventually, we discuss the possibility of solving the problem in the setting of functions, instead of measures.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Dean-Kawasaki Models of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems of interacting particles which are described by a second order Langevin equation, i.e., particles experiencing inertia. We introduce an associated equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics, which can be interpreted as stochastic version of a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. We show that this stochastic partial differential equation exhibits the same dichotomy as the corresponding first order (inertial-free) equation, the so-called Dean-Kawasaki equation: Solutions exist only for suitable atomic initial data, but not for smooth initial data. The class of systems covered includes several models of active matter.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the minimal surface system with large singular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lawson and Osserman proved that the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system is not always solvable in the class of Lipschitz maps. However, it is known that minimizing sequences (for area) of Lipschitz graphs converge to objects called Cartesian currents. Essentially nothing is known about these limits. We show that such limits can have surprisingly large interior vertical and non-minimal portions. This demonstrates a striking discrepancy between the parametric and non-parametric area minimization problems in higher codimension. Moreover, our construction has the smallest possible dimension ($n = 3$) and codimension $(m = 2)$.</description>

      <title>Characterising exchange of stability in scalar reaction-diffusion equations via geometric blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exchange of stability in scalar reaction-diffusion equations which feature a slow passage through transcritical and pitchfork type singularities in the reaction term, using a novel adaptation of the geometric blow-up method. Our results are consistent with known results on bounded spatial domains which were obtained by Butuzov, Nefedov &amp; Schneider using comparison principles like upper and lower solutions in [7], however, from a methodological point of view, the approach is motivated by the analysis of closely related ODE problems using geometric blow-up presented by Krupa &amp; Szmolyan in [34]. After applying the blow-up transformation, we obtain a system of PDEs which can be studied in local coordinate charts. Importantly, the blow-up procedure resolves a spectral degeneracy in which continuous spectrum along the entire negative real axis is 'pushed back' so as to create a spectral gap in the linearisation about particular steady states which arise within the so-called entry and exit charts. This makes it possible to extend slow-type invariant manifolds into and out of a neighbourhood of the singular point using center manifold theory, in a manner which is conceptually analogous to the established approach in the ODE setting. We expect that the approach can be adapted and applied to the study of dynamic bifurcations in PDEs in a wide variety of different contexts.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary dispersion and potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.</description>

Abstract: In harmonic analysis, studies of inequalities of Riesz potential in various function spaces have a very important place. Variable exponent Morrey type spaces and the examines of the boundedness of such operators on these spaces have an important place in harmonic analysis and have become an interesting field. In this work, we obtain the boundedness of Riesz potential on homogeneous variable exponent Herz-Morrey-Hardy spaces under some conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the Laplace-Beltrami operator with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces and study the Carleson's problem of pointwise convergence of the solution to its initial data along general curves that satisfy certain H\"older conditions and bilipschitz conditions in the distance from the identity. We obtain a sufficient condition on the regularity of the initial data for the above pointwise convergence to hold, which is sharp upto the endpoint. Certain Euclidean analogues are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film where electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being $300$ times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external electric fields, such as those induced by local defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several theoretical and numerical questions concerning the null controllability problems for linear parabolic equations and systems for several dimensions. The control is distributed and acts on a small subset of the domain. The main goal is to compute numerically a control that drives a numerical approximation of the state from prescribed initial data exactly to zero. We introduce a methodology for solving numerical controllability problems that is new in some sense. The main idea is to apply classical Lagrangian and Augmented Lagrangian techniques to suitable constrained extremal formulations that involve unbounded weights in time that make global Carleman inequalities possible. The theoretical results are validated by satisfactory numerical experiments for spatially 2D and 3D problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a closed, oriented ambient manifold $(M^n,g)$ we consider the problem of finding $\mathbb{S}^1$-valued harmonic maps with prescribed singular set. We show that the boundary of any oriented $(n-1)$-submanifold can be realised as the singular set of an $\mathbb{S}^1$-valued map, which is classically harmonic away from the singularity and distributionally harmonic across. If the singular set $\Gamma$ is also embedded and $C^{1,1}$, we consider three variational relaxations of the same problem and show that the energy of minimisers converges, after renormalisation, to the volume $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(\Gamma)$ plus a lower-order "renormalised energy" -- common to all relaxations -- describing an energetic interaction between different components of the singular set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new curvature condition for high-codimension submanifolds of a Riemannian ambient space, called quasi-parallel mean curvature (QPMC). The class of submanifolds with QPMC includes all CMC hypersurfaces and submanifolds with parallel mean curvature. We use our notion of QPMC to prove that certain kinds of high-curvature regions which appear in geometric flows, called bubblesheets, can be placed in a suitable normal form. This follows from a more general result asserting that the manifold $\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{S}^{n-k}$, equipped with any metric which is sufficiently close to the standard one, admits a canonical foliation by embedded $(n-k)$-spheres with QPMC.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the sampling observability for the heat equations with memory in the lower-order term, where the observation is conducted at a finite number of time instants and on a small open subset at each time instant. We present a two-sided sampling observability inequality and give a sharp sufficient condition to ensure the aforementioned inequality. We also provide a method to select the time instants and then to design the observation regions, based on a given memory kernel, such that the above-mentioned inequality holds for these time instants and observation regions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the positions of these time instants depend significantly on the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Poisson-Dirichlet problem with interior data in $L^{p'}$-Carleson spaces and its applications to the $L^{p}$-regularity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $L^{p'}$-solvability of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for an elliptic operator $L=-\operatorname{div}A\nabla$ with real and merely bounded coefficients is equivalent to the $L^{p'}$-solvability of the Poisson Dirichlet problem $Lw=H-\operatorname{div} F$, which is defined in terms of an $L^{p'}$ estimate on the non-tangential maximal function, assuming that $\operatorname{dist}(\cdot, \partial \Omega) H$ and $F$ lie in certain $L^{p'}$-Carleson-type spaces, and that the domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$, $n\geq2$, satisfies the corkscrew condition and has $n$-Ahlfors regular boundary. In turn, we use this result to show that, in a bounded domain with uniformly $n$-rectifiable boundary that satisfies the corkscrew condition, $L^{p'}$-solvability of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for an operator $L=-\operatorname{div} A\nabla$ satisfying the Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher condition (of arbitrarily large constant) implies solvability of the $L^p$-regularity problem for the adjoint operator $L^*=-\operatorname{div} A^T \nabla$, where $1/p+1/p'=1$ and $A^T$ is the transpose matrix of $A$. This result for Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher operators is new even if $\Omega$ is the unit ball, despite the fact that the $L^{p'}$-solvability of the Dirichlet problem for these operators in Lipschitz domains has been known since 2001.
  Further novel applications include i) new local estimates for the Green's function and its gradient in rough domains, ii) a local $T1$-type theorem for the $L^{p}$-solvability of the ``Poisson-Regularity problem'', itself equivalent to the $L^{p'}$-solvability of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem, in terms of certain gradient estimates for local landscape functions, and iii) new $L^p$ estimates for the eigenfunctions (and their gradients) of symmetric operators $L$ on bounded rough domains.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Minimization Problem In The Lowest Landau Level And Related Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a minimization problem related to the cubic Lowest Landau level equation, which is used in the study of Bose-Einstein condensation. We provide an optimal condition for the Gaussian to be the unique global minimizer. This extends previous results from P. G{\'e}rard, P. Germain and L. Thomann. We then provide another condition so that the second special Hermite function is a global minimizer.</description>

      <title>Singular Trudinger--Moser inequality involving $L^{p}$ norm in bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the method of blow-up analysis and capacity estimate to derive the singular Trudinger--Moser inequality involving $N$-Finsler--Laplacian and $L^{p}$ norm, precisely, for any $p&gt;1$, $0\leq\gamma&lt;\gamma_{1}:= \inf\limits_{u\in W^{1, N}_{0}(\Omega)\backslash \{0\}}\frac{\int_{\Omega}F^{N}(\nabla u)dx}{\| u\|_p^N}$ and $0\leq\beta&lt;N$, we have \begin{align} \sup_{u\in W_{0}^{1,N}(\Omega),\;\int_{\Omega}F^{N}(\nabla u)dx-\gamma\| u\|_p^N\leq1}\int_{\Omega}\frac{e^{\lambda_{N}(1-\frac{\beta}{N})\lvert u\rvert^{\frac{N}{N-1}}}}{F^{o}(x)^{\beta}}\;\mathrm{d}x&lt;+\infty\notag, \end{align} where $\lambda_{N}=N^{\frac{N}{N-1}} \kappa_{N}^{\frac{1}{N-1}}$ and $\kappa_{N}$ is the volume of a unit Wulff ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$, moreover, extremal functions for the inequality are also obtained. When $F=\lvert\cdot\rvert$ and $p=N$, we can obtain the singular version of Tintarev type inequality by the obove inequality, namely, for any $0\leq\alpha&lt;\alpha_{1}(\Omega):=\inf\limits_{u\in W^{1, N}_{0}(\Omega)\backslash \{0\}}\frac{\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^Ndx}{\| u\|_N^N}$ and $0\leq\beta&lt;N$, it holds $$ \sup_{u\in W_{0}^{1,N}(\Omega),\;\int_{\Omega}\lvert\nabla u\rvert^{N}\;\mathrm{d}x-\alpha\|u\|_{N}^{N}\leq1}\int_{\Omega}\frac{e^{\alpha_{N}(1-\frac{\beta}{N})\lvert u\rvert^{\frac{N}{N-1}}}}{\lvert x\rvert^{\beta}}\;\mathrm{d}x&lt;+\infty, $$ where $\alpha_{N}:=N^{\frac{N}{N-1}}\omega_{N}^{\frac{1}{N-1}}$ and $ \omega_{N}$ is the volume of unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Our results extend many well-known Trudinger--Moser type inequalities to more general setting.</description>

      <title>The sticky particle dynamics of the 1D pressureless Euler-alignment system as a gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the sticky dynamics for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler-alignment system can be obtained as an $L^2$-gradient flow of a convex functional. This is analogous to the Lagrangian evolution introduced by Natile and Savar\'{e} for the pressureless Euler system, and by Brenier et al. for the corresponding system with a self-interacting force field. Our Lagrangian evolution can be seen as the limit of sticky particle Cucker-Smale dynamics, similar to the solutions obtained by Leslie and Tan from a corresponding scalar balance law, and provides us with a uniquely determined distributional solution of the original system in the space of probability measures with quadratic moments and corresponding square-integrable velocities. Moreover, we show that the gradient flow also provides an entropy solution to the balance law of Leslie and Tan, and how their results on cluster formation follow naturally from (non-)monotonicity properties of the so-called natural velocity of the flow.</description>

      <title>Periodic gravity-capillary roll wave solutions to the inclined viscous shallow water equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study periodic, two-dimensional, gravity-capillary traveling wave solutions to a viscous shallow water system posed on an inclined plane. While thinking of the Reynolds and Bond numbers as fixed and finite, we vary the speed of the traveling frame and the degree of the incline and identify a set of the latter two parameters that classifies from which combinations nontrivial and small amplitude solution curves originate. Our principal technical tools are a combination of the implicit function theorem and a local multiparameter bifurcation theorem. To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper constitutes the first construction and mathematical study of properly two dimensional examples of viscous roll waves.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layers for Stokes Systems in Periodic Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotics of boundary layers in periodic homogenization. The analysis is focused on a Stokes system with periodic coefficients and periodic Dirichlet data posed in the half-space $\{y\in \mathbb{R}^d: y\cdot n -s&gt;0\}$. In particular, we establish the convergence of the velocity as $y\cdot n \rightarrow \infty$. We obtain this convergence for arbitrary normals $n\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Moreover, we build an asymptotic expansion of Poisson's kernel for the periodically oscillating Stokes operator in the half-space. The presence of the pressure and the incompressibility condition impose certain innovations. In particular, we provide a framework for the analysis of the boundary layers in homogenization that relies only on physical space techniques and not on techniques that rely on the quasiperiodic structure of the problem.</description>

Abstract: For $n \geq 2$, consider $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a lattice graph. We explore a generalized Chern-Simons equation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing the method of exhaustion, we prove that there exists a global solution that also qualifies as a topological solution. Our results extend those of Hua et al. [arXiv:2310.13905] and complement the findings of Chao and Hou [J. Math. Anal. Appl. $\bf{519}$(1), 126787(2023)], as well as those of Hou and Qiao [J. Math.

Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equations in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations $\nabla v = B \nabla u$ in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A\,{\rm grad}\, u = 0$ with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of their solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Strichartz estimates on rescaled waveguides with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the bilinear Strichartz estimates for free solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on rescaled waveguides $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda^n$, $\mathbb{T}_\lambda^n=(\lambda\mathbb{T})^n$ with $n\geq 1$ and their applications. First, we utilize a decoupling-type estimate originally from Fan-Staffilani-Wang-Wilson [Anal. PDE 11 (2018)] to establish a global-in-time bilinear Strichartz estimate with a `$N_2^\epsilon$' loss on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^n_\lambda$ when $n\geq1$, which generalize the local-in time estimate in Zhao-Zheng [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2021)] and fills a gap left by the unresolved case in Deng et al. [J. Func. Anal. 287 (2024)]. Second, we prove the local-in-time angularly refined bilinear Strichartz estimates on the 2d rescaled waveguide $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda$, which generalize the estimate obtained by Takaoka [J. Differ. Equa. 394 (2024)] with $\lambda=1$. As applications, we show the local well-posedness and small data scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with algebraic nonlinearities in the critical space on $\mathbb R^m\times\mathbb{T}^n$ and the global well-posedness for cubic NLS on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ in the lower regularity space $H^s$ with $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we identify a sharp ill-posedness/well-posedness threshold for kinetic wave equations (KWE) derived from quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger models. We show well-posedness using a collisional averaging estimate proved in our earlier work \cite{AmLe}. Ill-posedness manifests as instantaneous loss of smoothness for well-chosen initial data. We also prove that both the gain-only and full equation share the same well-posedness threhold, thus legitimizing a gain-only approach to solving 4-wave kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>Effective upper bounds on the number of resonance in potential scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the number of resonances and eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators $-\Delta+V$ with complex-valued potentials, where $d\geq 3$ is odd. The novel feature of our upper bounds is that they are \emph{effective}, in the sense that they only depend on an exponentially weighted norm of V. Our main focus is on potentials in the Lorentz space $L^{(d+1)/2,1/2}$, but we also obtain new results for compactly supported or pointwise decaying potentials. The main technical innovation, possibly of independent interest, are singular value estimates for Fourier-extension type operators. The obtained upper bounds not only recover several known results in a unified way, they also provide new bounds for potentials which are not amenable to previous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a $B$-continuous viscosity solution for a class of infinite dimensional semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) using probabilistic methods. Our approach also yields a stochastic representation formula for the solution in terms of a scalar-valued backward stochastic differential equation. The uniqueness is proved under additional assumptions using a comparison theorem for viscosity solutions. Our results constitute the first nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula using the notion of $B$-continuous viscosity solutions and thus introduces a framework allowing for generalizations to the case of fully nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Landau-de Gennes Q-tensor model of liquid crystals subjected to an electric field and develop a fully discrete numerical scheme for its solution. The scheme uses a convex splitting of the bulk potential, and we introduce a truncation operator for the Q-tensors to ensure well-posedness of the problem. We prove the stability and well-posedness of the scheme. Finally, making a restriction on the admissible parameters of the scheme, we show that up to a subsequence, solutions to the fully discrete scheme converge to weak solutions of the Q-tensor model as the time step and mesh are refined. We then present numerical results computed by the numerical scheme, among which we show that it is possible to simulate the Fr\'eedericksz transition with this scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of dilute polymers. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we survey some results on Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data. Among other things, we give a non-exhaustive list of various weak initial data which can be evolved with the Ricci flow. We also survey results which show that various curvature lower bounds will, possibly up to a constant, be preserved, if we start with such possibly non-smooth initial data.
