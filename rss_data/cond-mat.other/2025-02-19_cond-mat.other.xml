      <title>Ultrasound measurement technique for the single-turn-coil magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound is a powerful means to study numerous phenomena of condensed-matter physics as acoustic waves couple strongly to structural, magnetic, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present such technique combined with single-turn coils (STC) which generate magnetic fields beyond 100 T with the typical pulse duration of 6 us. As a benchmark of this technique, the ultrasound results for MnCr2S4, Cu6[Si6O18]6H2O, and liquid oxygen are shown. The resolution for the relative sound-velocity change in the STC is estimated as Delta v/v~10^-3, which is sufficient to study various field-induced phase transitions and critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Analytical Diagonalization of Fermi Gas-like Hamiltonians using the Sommerfeld-Watson Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sommerfeld-Watson transformation is a powerful mathematical technique widely used in physics to simplify summations over discrete quantum numbers by converting them into contour integrals in the complex plane. This method has applications in scattering theory, high-energy physics, quantum field theory, and electrostatics. A lesser-known but significant use is in the analytical diagonalization of specific Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, such as the Fermi gas Hamiltonian and the single-impurity Anderson model with vanishing Coulomb repulsion. These models are used to describe important phenomena like conductance in metals, x-ray photoemission, and aspects of the Kondo problem. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the Sommerfeld-Watson transformation and its application in diagonalization procedures for these models, using modern notation to enhance clarity for new students. The analytical results were validated against the numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement. Furthermore, we extend the presented method to a more generalized non-interacting single-impurity Anderson model with variable couplings and arbitrary band dispersion. The procedure presented here successfully achieved the analytical diagonalization of this more complex model, providing a unified solution that encompasses simpler cases. To our knowledge, this general solution has not been previously reported.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic clustering through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>
