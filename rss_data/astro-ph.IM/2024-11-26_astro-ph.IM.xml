      <title>Continuous Design and Reprogramming of Totimorphic Structures for Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a class of mechanical lattices with reconfigurable, zero-stiffness structures has been proposed, called Totimorphic structures. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that allows continuous reprogramming of a Totimorphic lattice's effective properties, such as mechanical and optical properties, via continuous geometric changes alone. Our approach is differentiable and guarantees valid Totimorphic lattice configurations throughout the optimisation process, thus providing not only specific configurations with desired properties but also trajectories through configuration space connecting them. It enables re-programmable structures where actuators are controlled via automatic differentiation on an objective-dependent cost function, altering the lattice structure at all times to achieve a given objective - which is interchangeable to achieve different functionalities. Our main interest lies in deep space applications where harsh, extreme, and resource-constrained environments demand solutions that offer flexibility, resource efficiency, and autonomy. We illustrate our framework through two proofs of concept: a re-programmable metamaterial as well as a space telescope mirror with adjustable focal length, both made from Totimorphic structures. The introduced framework is easily adjustable to a variety of Totimorphic designs and objectives, providing a light-weight model for endowing physical prototypes of Totimorphic structures with autonomous self-configuration and self-repair capabilities.</description>

      <title>tonalli: an asexual genetic code to characterise APOGEE-2 stellar spectra. I. Validation with synthetic and solar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present tonalli, a spectroscopic analysis python code that efficiently predicts effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, metallicity, $\alpha$-element abundance, and rotational and radial velocities for stars with effective temperatures between 3200 and 6250 K, observed with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2). tonalli implements an asexual genetic algorithm to optimise the finding of the best comparison between a target spectrum and the continuum-normalised synthetic spectra library from the Model Atmospheres with a Radiative and Convective Scheme (MARCS), which is interpolated in each generation. Using simulated observed spectra and the APOGEE-2 solar spectrum of Vesta, we study the performance, limitations, accuracy and precision of our tool. Finally, a Monte Carlo realisation was implemented to estimate the uncertainties of each derived stellar parameter. The ad hoc continuum-normalised library is publicly available on Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.12736546).</description>

      <title>A 400Gbit Ethernet core enabling High Data Rate Streaming from FPGAs to Servers and GPUs in Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased bandwidth coupled with the large numbers of antennas of several new radio telescope arrays has resulted in an exponential increase in the amount of data that needs to be recorded and processed. In many cases, it is necessary to process this data in real time, as the raw data volumes are too high to be recorded and stored. Due to the ability of graphics processing units (GPUs) to process data in parallel, GPUs are increasingly used for data-intensive tasks. In most radio astronomy digital instrumentation (e.g. correlators for spectral imaging, beamforming, pulsar, fast radio burst and SETI searching), the processing power of modern GPUs is limited by the input/output data rate, not by the GPU's computation ability. Techniques for streaming ultra-high-rate data to GPUs, such as those described in this paper, reduce the number of GPUs and servers needed, and make significant reductions in the cost, power consumption, size, and complexity of GPU based radio astronomy backends. In this research, we developed and tested several different techniques to stream data from network interface cards (NICs) to GPUs. We also developed an open-source UDP/IPv4 400GbE wrapper for the AMD/Xilinx IP demonstrating high-speed data stream transfer from a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to GPU.</description>

      <title>Distribution models of antennas in radio astronomy: Efficiency comparison of the golden spiral interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work compares the performance of different antenna configurations in radio astronomy interferometry, including the golden spiral, a grid, a random arrangement, and the "Y" configuration similar to the Very Large Array. One hundred antennas are simulated in each configuration, and the resulting UV coverage and image quality are analyzed. The results show that the golden spiral provides more uniform UV coverage without significant gaps, which improves image quality by reducing sidelobes and artifacts. In comparison, the grid exhibits periodic structures in the UV coverage that can degrade image quality due to gaps and artifacts. The random arrangement offers more natural coverage but is less efficient in terms of resolution and sidelobe control. The "Y" configuration proves effective in achieving high resolution along its arms but lacks complete coverage in certain directions, which can negatively affect image quality at those angles. The self-similar nature of the golden spiral allows for efficient capture of both large and small structures in observed sources, maximizing the spatial information obtained. We conclude that, for applications where resolution and sensitivity are critical, the golden spiral represents the optimal configuration, followed by the "Y" configuration, with the grid being the least suitable.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles necessitates addressing dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile that is closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide assistance for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5&lt;!PCT!&gt; for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be envisaged that the optimal indicator can provide insights into the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <title>You only thermoelastically deform once: Point Absorber Detection in LIGO Test Masses with YOLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future gravitational-wave observatories rely on large-scale, precision interferometers to detect the gravitational-wave signals. However, microscopic imperfections on the test masses, known as point absorbers, cause problematic heating of the optic via absorption of the high-power laser beam, which results in diminished sensitivity, lock loss, or even permanent damage. Consistent monitoring of the test masses is crucial for detecting, characterizing, and ultimately removing point absorbers. We present a machine-learning algorithm for detecting point absorbers based on the object-detection algorithm You Only Look Once (YOLO). The algorithm can perform this task in situ while the detector is in operation. We validate our algorithm by comparing it with past reports of point absorbers identified by humans at LIGO. The algorithm confidently identifies the same point absorbers as humans with minimal false positives. It also identifies some point absorbers previously not identified by humans, which we confirm with human follow-up. We highlight the potential of machine learning in commissioning efforts.</description>

      <title>The perfomance of generalized Davies-Cotton optical systems with infinitesimal mirror facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Taylor expansions for the imaging and timing characteristics of spherical optical systems with infinitesimal mirror facets, sometimes referred to as ''modified Davies-Cotton'' telescopes. Such a system comprises a discontinuous spherical mirror surface whose curvature radius is different from its focal length, and whose mirrors are aligned to suppress spherical aberration. Configurations that range between two ''optima'' are, one of which minimises tangential comatic aberration and the other that minimises timing dispersion.</description>

      <title>STDWeb: Simple Transient Detection pipeline for the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple web-based tool, STDWeb, for a quick-look photometry and transient detection in astronomical images. It tries to implement a self-consistent and mostly automatic data analysis workflow that would work on any image uploaded to it, allowing to perform basic interactive masking, do object detection, astrometrically calibrate the image, and build the photometric solution based on a selection of catalogues and supported filters, optionally including the color term and positionally varying zero point. It also allows you to do image subtraction using either user-provided or automatically downloaded template images, and do a forced photometry for a specified target in either original or difference images, as well as transient detection with basic rejection of artefacts. The tool may be easily deployed allowing its integration into the infrastructure of robotic telescopes or data archives for effortless analysis of their images.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Two Colour Intensity Interferometry with H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, intensity interferometry has been successfully applied to the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes H.E.S.S. , MAGIC, and VERITAS. All three telescope systems have proven the feasibility and capability of this method. After our first campaign in 2022, when two of the H.E.S.S. telescopes in Namibia were equipped with our external setup and the angular diameter of two stars was measured, our setup was upgraded for a second campaign in 2023, where the goal is to perform simultaneous two colour measurements. The second campaign not only involves a third equipped telescope, but also each mechanical setup now includes two interference filters at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 470 nm) with a broader bandwidth of 10 nm. This enables having simultaneous two colour measurements, which yields information about the star's physical size at different wavelengths. This is the first time that simultaneous dual-waveband intensity interferometry measurements are performed. The angular diameter results of the 4 stars, Mimosa (beta Cru), Eta Centauri (eta Cen), Nunki (sigma Sgr) and Dschubba (delta Sco), are reported, where the effects of limb darkening are also taken into account.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and RFI Classification with Unsupervised Learning in Narrowband Radio Technosignature Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for radio technosignatures is an anomaly detection problem: candidate signals represent needles of interest in the proverbial haystack of radio-frequency interference (RFI). Current search frameworks find an enormity of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone, suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the Choza et al. (2024) turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at L-band, demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive event reduction rate of 99.3%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-Cherenkov-based observatories form the high-duty-cycle and wide field of view backbone for observations of the gamma-ray sky at very high energies. For gamma-ray observations, precise event reconstruction and highly effective background rejection are crucial and have been continuously improving in recent years. In this work, we propose a deep learning application based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for background rejection and energy reconstruction and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches. We find that GNNs outperform hand-designed classification algorithms and observables in background rejection and find an improved energy resolution compared to template-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we describe how the IceCube Neutrino Observatory transformed a cubic kilometer of natural ice at the geographic South Pole into a neutrino telescope. The concept of using the neutrino as an astronomical messenger is as old as the neutrino itself, and the challenge to open this new window on the high-energy universe was technological in nature. We discuss how IceCube was constructed and how the detector operates, including some detail on the 5,484 optical sensors that comprise the array. We highlight some of the primary results of the experiment, including the discovery of a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, the observation of the first high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, and the observation of our Galaxy in neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of Kepler's Equation are critical components of celestial mechanics software, and are often computation hot spots. This work uses symbolic regression and a genetic learning algorithm to find new initial guesses for iterative Kepler solvers for both elliptical and hyperbolic orbits. The new initial guesses are simple to implement, and result in modest speed improvements for elliptical orbits, and major speed improvements for hyperbolic orbits.</description>

      <title>Null Stream Based Third-generation-ready Glitch Mitigation for Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors routinely encounter transient noise bursts, known as glitches, which are caused by either instrumental or environmental factors. Due to their high occurrence rate, glitches can overlap with GW signals, as in the notable case of GW170817, the first detection of a binary neutron star merger. Accurate reconstruction and subtraction of these glitches is a challenging problem that must be addressed to ensure that scientific conclusions drawn from the data are reliable. This problem will intensify with third-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET) due to their higher detection rates of GWs and the longer duration of signals within the sensitivity band of the detectors. Robust glitch mitigation algorithms are, therefore, crucial for maximizing the scientific output of next-generation GW observatories. For the first time, we demonstrate how the null stream inherent in ET's unique triangular configuration can be leveraged by state-of-the-art glitch characterization methodology to essentially undo the effect of glitches for the purpose of estimating the parameters of the source. The null stream based approach enables characterization and subtraction of glitches that occur arbitrarily close to the peak of the signal without any significant effect on the quality of parameter measurements, and achieves an order of magnitude computational speed-up compared to when the null stream is not available. By contrast, without the null stream, significant biases can occur in the glitch reconstruction, which deteriorate the quality of subsequent measurements of the source parameters. This demonstrates a clear edge which the null stream can offer for precision GW science in the ET era.</description>

      <title>SURF Report: High Accuracy Methods for Computing Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Force Fields Near the Surface of Irregularly Shaped 3-Dimensional Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate gravity field calculations are necessary for landing on planets, moons, asteroids, minimoons, or other irregularly shaped bodies, but current methods become increasingly inaccurate and slow near the surface. We present high accuracy, fast methods for computing gravitational potential and gravitational force fields, which are needed for future space missions. Notably, gravitational force and potential computations are simplified, with high accuracy enhanced by bringing the derivative inside the gravitational potential integral. In addition, we present a new gravitational field calculus, which lets us combine simpler potentials and force fields to create more complex ones without accuracy loss. Several examples are provided, for instance, where we subtract different shapes from a spherical body making a variety of craters. The calculus will also work well with volumetric octree methods. Additionally, we use new bounds in the gravitational potential integral, to avoid trying to fit smooth basis functions to non-smooth curves, and harness new computational tools where tasks can be migrated to GPUs. We also have found that cylindrical coordinates can have special advantages in tailoring shape models. We have created a series of algorithms and preliminary MATLAB and Mathematica toolboxes utilizing these methods and the gravitational calculus. These methods are newly customizable for necessary high-accuracy gravity computations in future missions planned by JPL and other space agencies to navigate near irregularly shaped bodies in the solar system.</description>

      <title>Modeling of optical scattering from topographic surface measurements of high-quality mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit computational methods to obtain an angular profile of optical scattering from a smooth surface, given a two-dimensional map of topographic height errors of the surface. Quick derivations of some traditional equations and relevant references are organized to shorten the search time. A practical data-processing flow of the methods is discussed. As a case study of this flow, the core mirrors of the KAGRA interferometer are examined, and we obtain a representative scattering profile that is easily applicable to ray-tracing simulations.</description>

      <title>Kalkayotl 2.0 Bayesian phase-space modelling of star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters are fundamental stellar systems where predictions from star-formation theories can be robustly contrasted with observations. Aims: We aim to provide the astrophysical community with a free and open-source code to infer the phase-space (i.e. positions and velocities) parameters of stellar systems with $\lesssim$1000 stars based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry and possibly observed radial velocities. Methods: We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model and extend it to model 3D (positions) and 6D (positions and velocities) stellar coordinates and system parameters with a flexible variety of statistical models, including a linear velocity field. This velocity field allows for the inference of internal kinematics, including expansion, contraction, and rotation. Results: We extensively validated our statistical models using realistic simulations that mimic the properties of the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We applied \textit{Kalkayotl} to $\beta$-Pictoris, the Hyades, and Praesepe, recovering parameter values compatible with those from the literature. In particular, we found an expansion age of $19.1\pm1.0$ Myr for $\beta$-Pictoris and rotational signal of $32\!\pm\!11\,\rm{m\,s^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}$ for the Hyades and that Praesepe's rotation reported in the literature comes from its periphery. Conclusions: The robust and flexible Bayesian hierarchical model that we make publicly available here represents a step forward in the statistical modelling of stellar systems. The products it delivers, such as expansion, contraction, rotation, and velocity dispersions, can be directly contrasted with predictions from star-formation theories.</description>

      <title>Solaris: A Foundation Model of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success across various scientific domains, motivating our exploration of their potential in solar physics. In this paper, we present Solaris, the first foundation model for forecasting the Sun's atmosphere. We leverage 13 years of full-disk, multi-wavelength solar imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, spanning a complete solar cycle, to pre-train Solaris for 12-hour interval forecasting. Solaris is built on a large-scale 3D Swin Transformer architecture with 109 million parameters. We demonstrate Solaris' ability to generalize by fine-tuning on a low-data regime using a single wavelength (1700 {\AA}), that was not included in pre-training, outperforming models trained from scratch on this specific wavelength. Our results indicate that Solaris can effectively capture the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and transform solar forecasting.</description>

      <title>AtomNeb: IDL Library and Python Package for Atomic Data of Ionized Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.02528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectra emitted from ionized nebulae typically contain collisionally excited and recombination lines, which can be used to trace physical conditions and chemical abundances of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and other galaxies. "AtomNeb" is a database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) file format, including the data for collisionally excited and recombination lines often observed in nebular astrophysics. The AtomNeb interface library is equipped with several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), also usable in the GNU Data Language (GDL), and in the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python. The IDL library relies on the FITS file-related IDL procedures from the IDL Astronomy User's library, while the Python package depends on the Python packages Astropy and NumPy. The AtomNeb IDL library and the corresponding Python package, in conjunction with the "proEQUIB" IDL library and "pyEQUIB" Python package, respectively, can be used to perform plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of emission lines from ionized gaseous nebulae.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. III. Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution IFU Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the spectrophotometric calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This calibration is complicated by a time-dependent evolution in the effective throughput of the MRS; this evolution is strongest at long wavelengths, approximately a factor of 2 at 25um over the first two years of the mission. We model and correct for this evolution through regular observations of internal calibration lamps. Pixel flatfields are constructed from observations of the infrared-bright planetary nebula NGC 7027, and photometric aperture corrections from a combination of theoretical models and observations of bright standard stars. We tie the 5--18um flux calibration to high signal/noise (S/N; ~ 600-1000) observations of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae, scaled to the average calibration factor of nine other spectrophotometric standards. We calibrate the 18--28um spectral range using a combination of observations of main belt asteroid 515 Athalia and the circumstellar disk around young stellar object SAO 206462. The photometric repeatability is stable to better than 1% in the wavelength range 5--18um, and the S/N ratio of the delivered spectra is consistent between bootstrapped measurements, pipeline estimates, and theoretical predictions. The MRS point-source calibration agrees with that of the MIRI imager to within 1% from 7 to 21um and is approximately 1% fainter than prior Spitzer observations, while the extended source calibration agrees well with prior Cassini/CIRS and Voyager/IRIS observations.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly Protege: Discovery Through Human-Machine Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as glitches, which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Identifying Spicules in Mg II: Statistics and Comparisons with H{\alpha}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun's chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen~Alpha (H{\alpha}, 6563 {\AA}), Ca II (8542 {\AA}, k 3934 {\AA}), Mg II (h 2803 {\AA}, k 2796 {\AA}), and Si IV (1394 {\AA}, 1405 {\AA}) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H$\alpha$ and Ca II. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg II or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$ 1216 {\AA}) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules' impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.</description>
