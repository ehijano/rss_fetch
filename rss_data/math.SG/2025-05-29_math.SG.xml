      <title>A Homotopical Invariant of Weinstein Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One generally expects that the techniques of arboreal singularities and gluing of local differential graded categories will result in a useful global invariant for all Weinstein manifolds. In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.</description>

      <title>Sampling Finite Unit Norm Tight Frames Using Symplectic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unit-norm tight frames in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (FUNTFs) are fundamental in signal processing, offering optimal robustness to noise and measurement loss. In this paper we introduce the Eigenlift algorithm for sampling random FUNTFs. Our approach exploits the symplectic geometry of the FUNTF space, which we characterize as a symplectic reduction of frame space by a symmetry group. We then define a Hamiltonian torus action on this reduced space whose momentum map induces a fiber bundle structure. The algorithm proceeds by sampling a point from the base space, which is a convex polytope, lifting it deterministically to a point on the corresponding fiber, then acting on this point by a random element of the torus to obtain a random FUNTF. We implement the method in Python and validate it in low-dimensional settings where it is computationally feasible to sample the base polytope via rejection sampling.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology, shift operators, and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated quantized Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we give a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subalgebra of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators can naturally be defined. As a main application, we show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH_G^\bullet(X)$ defines a quasi-coherent sheaf of algebras on the Coulomb branch with coisotropic support. Upon specializing the Novikov and bulk parameters, this sheaf becomes coherent with Lagrangian support. We also apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing construction for Coulomb branches and derive different generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-dimensional oriented handlebody without 3- and 4-handles can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We furthermore show that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. We also prove that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of genus function type for diffeomorphism invariants and show that similar results hold for any such invariant. As an application of our exotic 4-manifolds, we also prove that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified to admit infinitely many exotically knotted copies.</description>
