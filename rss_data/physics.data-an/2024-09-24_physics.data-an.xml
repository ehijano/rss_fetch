      <title>Bayesian forecasting with information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting techniques for assessing the power of future experiments to discriminate between theories or discover new laws of nature are of great interest in many areas of science. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian forecasting method using information theory. We argue that mutual information is a suitable quantity to study in this context. Besides being Bayesian, this proposal has the advantage of not relying on the choice of fiducial parameters, describing the "true" theory (which is a priori unknown), and is applicable to any probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for parameter estimation and model selection, both of which are of interest concerning future experiments. We argue that mutual information has plausible interpretation in both situations. In addition, we state a number of propositions that offer information-theoretic meaning to some of the Bayesian practices such as performing multiple experiments, combining different datasets, and marginalization.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Reconstruction with Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the electric field from the measured voltages in an antenna, unfolding the antenna response, comes with several problems. Due to the noisiness of the signal it is often necessary to disregard part of the bandwidth of the antenna. It is also not guaranteed, that this system of equations can be inverted at all. In any case, the noise of the measurement will be converted into noise on the electric field. This could be solved by Bayesian inference, however, the electric field is continuous, which would lead to an infinite-dimensional latent space. Information field theory (IFT) has been developed to deal with this problem and allow for Bayesian reasoning on fields. It provides a theoretical backbone and effective tools to approach the inference as a discrete problem in the continuum limit, taking the continuous nature of fields into account. We will present a first working signal model that can be used with IFT-based inference algorithms, which can successfully reconstruct the electric field. The model is based on the current understanding of air shower emission physics, modelling geomagnetic and charge-excess emission and their respective polarisation and spectra separately. Since Bayesian inference provides the posterior distribution, this method also gives an estimate on the uncertainty of the measured field. The performance of this method will be demonstrated with Monte-Carlo simulations of air shower radio signals.</description>

      <title>Predictability Analysis and Prediction of Discrete Weather and Financial Time-Series Data with a Hamiltonian-Based Filter-Projection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation (GLE), derived by projection from a general many-body Hamiltonian, exactly describes the dynamics of an arbitrary coarse-grained variable in a complex environment. However, analysis and prediction of real-word data with the GLE is hampered by slow transient or seasonal data components and time-discretization effects. Machine-learning (ML) techniques work but are computer-resource demanding and difficult to interpret. We show that by convolution filtering, time-series data decompose into fast, transient and seasonal components that each obey Hamiltonian dynamics and, thus, can be separately analyzed by projection techniques. We introduce methods to extract all GLE parameters from highly discretized time-series data and to forecast future data including the environmental stochasticity. For daily-resolved weather data, our analysis reveals non-Markovian memory that decays over a few days. Our prediction accuracy is comparable to commercial (weather.com) and ML long short-term memory (LSTM) methods at a reduced computational cost by a factor of $10^2-10^3$ compared to LSTM. For financial data, memory is very short-ranged and the dynamics effectively is Markovian, in agreement with the efficient-market hypothesis; consequently, models simpler than the GLE are sufficient. Our GLE framework is an efficient and interpretable method for the analysis and prediction of complex time-series data.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanical Analysis of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze Gaussian processes using statistical mechanics. Although the input is originally multidimensional, we simplify our model by considering the input as one-dimensional for statistical mechanical analysis. Furthermore, we employ periodic boundary conditions as an additional modeling approach. By using periodic boundary conditions, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix. The diagonalized covariance matrix is then applied to Gaussian processes. This allows for a statistical mechanical analysis of Gaussian processes using the derived diagonalized matrix. We indicate that the analytical solutions obtained in this method closely match the results from simulations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the predictability of dynamical systems: a new local data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive a faithful representation. Here, we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. Applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets, this new index shows results consistent with existing knowledge, proving its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with local dynamical indices, illustrating how it complements the previous framework as a more direct measure of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its reflection of the scale-dependent nature of predictability, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model discovery of complex dynamical systems is typically done using sparse optimization, but it has a fundamental limitation: sparsity in that the underlying governing equations of the system contain only a small number of elementary mathematical terms. Examples where sparse optimization fails abound, such as the classic Ikeda or optical-cavity map in nonlinear dynamics and a large variety of ecosystems. Exploiting the recently articulated Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, we develop a general model-discovery framework for any dynamical systems including those that do not satisfy the sparsity condition. In particular, we demonstrate non-uniqueness in that a large number of approximate models of the system can be found which generate the same invariant set with the correct statistics such as the Lyapunov exponents and Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analogy to shadowing of numerical trajectories in chaotic systems is pointed out.</description>

      <title>Texture tomography with high angular resolution utilizing sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to the reconstruction of scanning probe x-ray diffraction tomography data with anisotropic poly crystalline samples. The method involves reconstructing a voxel map containing an orientation distribution function in each voxel of an extended 3D sample. This method differs from existing approaches by not relying on a peak-finding and is therefore applicable to sample systems consisting of small and highly mosaic crystalline domains that are not handled well by existing methods. Samples of interest include bio-minerals and a range of small-graines microstructures common in engineering metals. By choosing a particular kind of basis functions, we can effectively utilize non-negativity in orientation-space for samples with sparse texture. This enables us to achieve stable solutions at high angular resolutions where the problem would otherwise be under determined. We demonstrate the new approach using data from a shot peened martensite sample where we are able to map the twinning micro structure in the interior of a bulk sample without resolving the individual lattice domains. We also demonstrate the approach on a piece of gastropods shell with a mosaic micro structure.</description>
