      <title>Searching for groups related to pseudo-composition algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of idempotent-generated pseudo-composition algebras, which is a subclass of the family of axial algebras. More specifically, we utilise the group-algebra correspondence, natural to the axial framework in order to study some automorphism subgroups of such pseudo-composition algebras.</description>

      <title>Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We strengthen the results of Boltje and Yilmaz regarding the Galois descent of equivalences of blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups and a result of Kessar and Linckelmann regarding Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks with compatible Galois stabilizers. A more general descent criteria for chain complexes is proven along the way, which requires the adaptation of a theorem of Reiner for chain complexes. This verifies Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup.</description>

      <title>On a family of simple skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several constructions have been given for families of simple braces, but few examples are known of simple skew braces which are not braces. In this paper, we exhibit the first example of an infinite family of simple skew braces which are not braces and which do not arise from nonabelian simple groups. More precisely, we show that, for any primes $p$, $q$ such that $q$ divides ${(p^p-1)}/{(p-1)}$, there are exactly two simple skew braces (up to isomorphism) of order $p^p q$.</description>

      <title>Looking for a Refined Monster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some categorical aspects of the objects that appear in the construction of the Monster and other sporadic simple groups. We define the basic representation of the categorical torus $\mathcal T$ classified by an even symmetric bilinear form $I$ and of the semi-direct product of $\mathcal T$ with its canonical involution. We compute the centraliser of the basic representation of $\mathcal T\rtimes\{\pm1\}$ and find it to be a categorical extension of the extraspecial $2$-group with commutator $I\mod 2$. We study the inertia groupoid of a categorical torus and find that it is given by the torsor of the topological Looijenga line bundle, so that $2$-class functions on $\mathcal T$ are canonically theta-functions. We discuss how discontinuity of the categorical character in our formalism means that the character of the basic representation fails to be a categorical class function. We compute the automorphisms of $\mathcal T$ and of $\mathcal T\rtimes\{\pm1\}$ and relate these to the Conway groups.</description>

      <title>On the connectivity of the generating and rank graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generating graph encodes how generating pairs are spread among the elements of a group. For more than ten years it has been conjectured that this graph is connected for every finite group. In this paper, we give evidence supporting this conjecture: we prove that it holds for all but a finite number of almost simple groups and give a reduction to groups without non-trivial soluble normal subgroups. Let $d(G)$ be the minimal cardinality of a generating set for $G$. When $d(G)\geq3$, the generating graph is empty and the conjecture is trivially true. We consider it in the more general setting of the rank graph, which encodes how pairs of elements belonging to generating sets of minimal cardinality spread among the elements of a group. It carries information even when $d(G)\geq3$ and corresponds to the generating graph when $d(G)=2$. We prove that it is connected whenever $d(G)\geq3$, giving tools and ideas that may be used to address the original conjecture.</description>

      <title>Salter's question on the image of the Burau representation of $B_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the question of under what conditions a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries is in the image of the Burau representation. In 1984, Squier observed that the matrices in the image are contained in a unitary group. In 2021, Salter formulated a specific question: whether the central quotient of the Burau image group is the central quotient of a certain subgroup of the unitary group. We solve this question negatively in the simplest nontrivial case, $n=3$, algorithmically constructing a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Around subgroups of Artin groups: derived subgroups and acylindrical hyperbolicity in the even FC-case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize to (certain) Artin groups some results previously known for right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). First, we generalize a result by Droms, B. Servatius, and H. Servatius, and prove that the derived subgroup of an Artin group is free if and only if the group is coherent. Second, coherent Artin groups over non complete graphs split as free amalgamated products along free abelian subgroups, and we extend to arbitrary Artin groups admitting such a splitting a recent result by Casals-Ruiz and the first author on finitely generated normal subgroups of RAAGs. Finally, we use splittings of even Artin groups of FC-type to generalize results of Minasyan and Osin on acylindrical hyperbolicity of their subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize when a finite group G possesses a Sylow 3-subgroup P with abelianization of order 9 in terms of the number of height zero characters lying in the principal 3-block of G, settling a conjecture put forward by Navarro, Sambale, and Tiep in 2018. Along the way, we show that a recent result by Laradji on the number of character of height zero in a block that lie above a given character of some normal subgroup holds, without any hypothesis on the group for blocks of maximal defect.</description>

      <title>On wreath product occurring as subgroup of automata group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finitely generated group is said to be an automata group if it admits a faithful self-similar finite-state representation on some regular $m$-tree. We prove that if $G$ is a subgroup of an automata group, then for each finitely generated abelian group $A$, the wreath product $A \wr G$ is a subgroup of an automata group. We obtain, for example, that $C_2 \wr (C_{2} \wr \mathbb{Z})$, $\mathbb{Z} \wr (C_2 \wr \mathbb{Z})$, $C_2 \wr (\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z})$, and $\mathbb{Z} \wr (\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z})$ are subgroups of automata groups. In the particular case $\mathbb{Z} \wr (\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z})$, we prove that it is a subgroup of a two-letters automata group; this solves Problem 15.19 - (b) of the Kourovka Notebook proposed by A. M. Brunner and S. Sidki in 2000 [8, 17].</description>

Abstract: We find anti-isomorphic submonoids $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ and $\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$ of the bicyclic monoid $\mathscr{C}(a,b)$ with the following properties: every Hausdorff left-continuous (right-continuous) topology on $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) is discrete and there exists a compact Hausdorff topological monoid $S$ which contains $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) as a submonoid. Also, we construct a non-discrete right-continuous (left-continuous) topology $\tau_p^+$ ($\tau_p^-$) on the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) which is not left-continuous (right-continuous).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A$ is a finite group (or a finite ring) and $\omega$ is a word map (or a polynomial map), we define the quantity $|\omega(A)|/|A|$ as the image ratio of $\omega$ on $A$ and will be denoted by $\mu(\omega,A)$. In this article, we investigate the set $\mathrm{R}(\omega)=\{\mu(\omega,A) : A \text{ is a finite group}\}$, and also consider the case of rings. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of word maps (and polynomial maps) whose set of image ratios is dense in $[0,1]$ for both groups (and rings).</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of rational representations for algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the cohomology of subgroups $\Gamma$ of an algebraic group $G$ with coefficients in the various irreducible rational representations of $G$ and raise a conjecture about it. Namely, we expect that the dimensions of these cohomology groups approximate the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of $\Gamma$ with a controlled error term. We provide positive answers when $G$ is a product of copies of $SL_2$. As an application, we obtain new proofs of J. Lott's and W. L\"uck's computation of the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds and W. Fu's upper bound on the growth of cusp forms for non totally real fields, which is sharp in the imaginary quadratic case.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ converges strongly to a family $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ in a $C^*$-algebra if $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x})\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a central role in several recent breakthrough results on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, strong convergence is notoriously difficult to prove and has generally required delicate problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a detailed understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>SIGNLINE: Digital signature scheme based on linear equations cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explores a novel cryptosystem for digital signatures based on linear equa-tions for logarithmic signatures. A logarithmic signature serves as a fundamental cryptographic primitive, characterized by properties such as nonlinearity, non-commutability, unidirectionality, and key-dependent factorability. The proposed cryptosystem ensures the secrecy of logarithmic signatures through its foundation in linear equations. Quantum security is achieved by eliminating any possible mapping between the input and output of the logarithmic signature, thereby rendering Grover's quantum attack ineffective. The public key sizes for the NIST security levels of 128, 192, and 256 bits are 1, 1.5, and 2 KB, respectively. The algorithm demonstrates scalability concerning computational costs, memory usage, and hardware limitations without compromising security. Its primary operation involves bitwise XOR over logarithmic arrays of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the harmonic generalizations of well-known polynomials of codes over finite fields, namely the higher weight enumerators and the extended weight enumerators, and we derive the correspondences between these weight enumerators. Moreover, we present the harmonic generalization of Greene's Theorem for the higher (resp. extended) weight enumerators. As an application of this Greene's-type theorem, we provide the MacWilliams-type identity for harmonic higher weight enumerators of codes over finite fields. Finally, we use this new identity to give a new proof of the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for subcode supports of linear codes over finite fields using harmonic higher weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Division rings for group algebras of virtually compact special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a division ring and let $G$ be either a torsion-free virtually compact special group or a torsion-free $3$-manifold group. We embed the group algebra $kG$ in a division ring and prove that the embedding is Hughes-free whenever $G$ is locally indicable. In particular, we prove that Kaplansky's zerodivisor conjecture holds for all group algebras of torsion-free $3$-manifold groups. The embedding is also used to confirm a conjecture of Kielak and Linton. Thanks to the work of Jaikin-Zapirain, another consequence of the embedding is that $kG$ is coherent whenever $G$ is a virtually compact special one-relator group.
  If $G$ is a torsion-free one-relator group, let $\overline{kG}$ be the division ring containing $kG$ constructed by Lewin and Lewin. We prove that $\overline{kG}$ is Hughes-free whenever a Hughes-free $kG$-division ring exists. This is always the case when $k$ is of characteristic zero; in positive characteristic, our previous result implies this happens when $G$ is virtually compact special.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Endotrivial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $p$ a prime, and $k$ a field of characteristic $p$. We introduce the notion of an endotrivial chain complex of $p$-permutation $kG$-modules, which are the invertible objects in the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation $kG$-modules, and study the corresponding Picard group $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ of endotrivial complexes. Such complexes are shown to induce splendid Rickard autoequivalences of $kG$. The elements of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ are determined uniquely by integral invariants arising from the Brauer construction and a degree one character $G \to k^\times$. Using ideas from Bouc's theory of biset functors, we provide a canonical decomposition of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$, and as an application, give complete descriptions of $\mathcal{E}_k(G)$ for abelian groups and $p$-groups of normal $p$-rank 1. Taking Lefschetz invariants of endotrivial complexes induces a group homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$, where $O(T(kG))$ is the orthogonal unit group of the trivial source ring. Using recent results of Boltje and Carman, we give a Frobenius stability condition elements in the image of $\Lambda$ must satisfy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in novel Clifford geometric invariants of linear transformations. This motivates the investigation of such invariants for a certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root systems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter transformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter transformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple roots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This computational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using techniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal component analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined by the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding reflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping. This provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that the datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a pump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing that such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and shedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known geometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise Geometric Property (T) by the existence of a certain projection in the maximal uniform Roe algebra $C_{u,\max}^*(X)$, extending the notion of Kazhdan projection for groups to the realm of metric spaces. We also describe this projection in terms of the decomposition of the metric space into coarsely connected components.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}(2,A)$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}(2,K)$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}(n,A)$ and $\operatorname{SL}(n,A)$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>

      <title>Sums of binomial coefficients modulo $p$ and groups of exponent $p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple matrix-based proof of congruence equations modulo a prime $p$ involving sums of binomial coefficients appearing in Pascal's triangle. These equations can be used to construct some groups of exponent $p^n$. These groups, as well as others of exponent $p^{n+1}$, explain why $p=2$ is not really an exceptional prime in relation to the Heisenberg group over the field with $p$ elements.</description>

      <title>On Growth Functions of Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W, S)$ be a Coxeter system of rank $n$ and let $p_{(W, S)}(t)$ be its growth function. It is known that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) &lt; \infty$ holds for all $n \leq q \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper we will show that this still holds for $q = n-1$, if $(W, S)$ is $2$-spherical. Moreover, we will prove that $p_{(W, S)}(q^{-1}) = \infty$ holds for $q = n-2$, if the Coxeter diagram of $(W, S)$ is the complete graph. These two results provide a complete characterization of the finiteness of the growth function in the case of $2$-spherical Coxeter systems with complete Coxeter diagram.</description>
