      <title>tinygarden -- A java package for testing properties of spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spanning trees are fundamental objects in graph theory. The spanning tree set size of an arbitrary graph can be very large. This limitation discourages its analysis. However interesting patterns can emerge in small cases. In this article we introduce \emph{tinygarden}, a java package for validating hypothesis, testing properties and discovering patterns from the spanning tree set of an arbitrary graph.</description>

      <title>First-Fit Coloring of Forests in Random Arrival Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a graph coloring algorithm that processes vertices in order taken uniformly at random and assigns colors to them using First-Fit strategy. We show that this algorithm uses, in expectation, at most $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1))\cdot \ln n \,/\, \ln\ln n$ different colors to color any forest with $n$ vertices. We also construct a family of forests that shows that this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Solving the Graph Burning Problem for Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an exact algorithm for the Graph Burning Problem ($\texttt{GBP}$), an NP-hard optimization problem that models the spread of influence on social networks. Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, the objective is to find a sequence of $k$ vertices in $V$, namely, $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$, such that $k$ is minimum and $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} \{u\! \in\! V\! : d(u, v_i) \leq k - i\} = V$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$. We formulate the problem as a set covering integer programming model and design a row generation algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$. Our method exploits the fact that a very small number of covering constraints is often sufficient for solving the integer model, allowing the corresponding rows to be generated on demand. To date, the most efficient exact algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$, denoted here by $\texttt{GDCA}$, is able to obtain optimal solutions for graphs with up to 14,000 vertices within two hours of execution. In comparison, our algorithm finds provably optimal solutions approximately 236 times faster, on average, than $\texttt{GDCA}$. For larger graphs, memory space becomes a limiting factor for $\texttt{GDCA}$. Our algorithm, however, solves real-world instances with almost 200,000 vertices in less than 35 seconds, increasing the size of graphs for which optimal solutions are known by a factor of 14.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Minimum Spanning Tree Cycle Intersection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum spanning trees are important tools in the analysis and design of networks. Many practical applications require their computation, ranging from biology and linguistics to economy and telecommunications. The set of cycles of a network has a vector space structure. Given a spanning tree, the set of non-tree edges defines cycles that determine a basis. The intersection of two such cycles is the number of edges they have in common and the intersection number -- denoted $\cap(G)$ -- is the number of non-empty pairwise intersections of the cycles of the basis. The Minimum Spanning Tree Cycle Intersection problem consists in finding a spanning tree such that the intersection number is minimum. This problem is relevant in order to integrate discrete differential forms. In this paper, we present two lower bounds of the intersection number of an arbitrary connected graph $G=(V,E)$. In the first part, we prove the following statement: $$\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\nu^2}{n-1} - \nu\right) \leq \cap(G),$$ where $n = |V|$ and $\nu$ is the \emph{cyclomatic number} of $G$. In the second part, based on some experimental results and a new observation, we conjecture the following improved tight lower bound: $$(n-1) \binom{q}{2} + q \ r\leq \cap(G),$$ where $2 \nu = q (n-1) + r$ is the integer division of $2 \nu$ and $n-1$. This is the first result in a general context, that is for an arbitrary connected graph.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Interval Analysis of Unreliable Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancement of chip technology will make future computer chips faster. Power consumption of such chips shall also decrease. But this speed gain shall not come free of cost, there is going to be a trade-off between speed and efficiency, i.e accuracy of the computation. In order to achieve this extra speed we will simply have to let our computers make more mistakes in computations. Consequently, systems built with these type of chips will possess an innate unreliability lying within. Programs written for these systems will also have to incorporate this unreliability. Researchers have already started developing programming frameworks for unreliable architectures as such.
  In the present work, we use a restricted version of C-type languages to model the programs written for unreliable architectures. We propose a technique for statically analyzing codes written for these kind of architectures. Our technique, which primarily focuses on Interval/Range Analysis of this type of programs, uses the well established theory of abstract interpretation. While discussing unreliability of hardware, there comes scope of failure of the hardware components implicitly. There are two types of failure models, namely: 1) permanent failure model, where the hardware stops execution on failure and 2) transient failure model, where on failure, the hardware continues subsequent operations with wrong operand values. In this paper, we've only taken transient failure model into consideration. The goal of this analysis is to predict the probability with which a program variable assumes values from a given range at a given program point.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes Q_{n,2} with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The (n, k)-enhanced hypercube Q_{n,k} as a variation of the hypercube Q_{n}, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, h-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph G, \lambda_h(G), is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the h-extra edge-connectivity of the (n,2)-enhanced hypercube Q_{n,2}. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network Q_{n,2} does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than h-1 processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrate on a constant 2^{n-1} for each integer \lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1} and n\geq 9. That is, for about 77.083 percent values of h\leq2^{n-1}, the corresponding h-extra edge-connectivity of Q_{n,2}, \lambda_h(Q_{n,2}), presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the above lower and upper bounds of h are both tight.</description>

      <title>Bipartite powers of some classes of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph powers are a well-studied concept in graph theory. Analogous to graph powers, Chandran et al.[3] introduced the concept of bipartite powers for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we will demonstrate that some well-known classes of bipartite graphs, namely the interval bigraphs, proper interval bigraphs, and bigraphs of Ferrers dimension 2, are closed under the operation of taking bipartite powers. Finally, we define strongly closed property for bipartite graphs under powers and have shown that the class of chordal bipartite graphs is strongly closed under powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that for every apex-forest $X$ on at least two vertices, graphs excluding $X$ as a minor have layered pathwidth at most $2|V(X)|-3$. This improves upon a result by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Joret, Morin, and Wood (SIDMA, 2020). Our main tool is a structural result about graphs excluding a forest as a rooted minor, which is of independent interest. We develop similar tools for treedepth and treewidth. We discuss implications for Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa properties of rooted models of minors in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rectangulations are decompositions of a square into finitely many axis-aligned rectangles. We describe realizations of (n-1)-dimensional polytopes associated with two combinatorial families of rectangulations composed of n rectangles. They are defined as quotientopes of natural lattice congruences on the weak Bruhat order on permutations in S_n, and their skeleta are flip graphs on rectangulations. We give simple vertex and facet descriptions of these polytopes, in particular elementary formulas for computing the coordinates of the vertex corresponding to each rectangulation, in the spirit of J.-L. Loday's realization of the associahedron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study half-space separation in the convexity of chordless paths of a graph, i.e., monophonic convexity. In this problem, one is given a graph and two (disjoint) subsets of vertices and asks whether these two sets can be separated by complementary convex sets, called half-spaces. While it is known this problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete for geodesic convexity -- the convexity of shortest paths -- we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for monophonic convexity.</description>

      <title>A heuristic search algorithm for discovering large Condorcet domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of large Condorcet domains (CD) has been a significant area of interest in voting theory. In this paper, our goal is to search for large CDs that are hitherto unknown. With a straightforward combinatorial definition, searching for large CDs is naturally suited for algorithmic optimisations. For each value of n&gt;2, one can ask for the size of the largest CD, thus finding the largest CDs provides an important benchmark for heuristic-based combinatorial optimisation algorithms. Despite extensive research over the past three decades, the CD sizes identified in 1996 remain the best known for many values of n. When n&gt;8, conducting an exhaustive search becomes computationally unfeasible, thereby prompting the use of heuristic methods. To address this, we developed a novel heuristic search algorithm in which a specially designed heuristic function, backed by a lookup database, directs the search towards promising branches in the search tree. Our algorithm found new large CDs of size 1082 (surpassing the previous record of 1069) for n=10, and 2349 (improving the previous 2324) for n=11. Notably, these newly discovered CDs exhibit characteristics distinct from those of known CDs.</description>

      <title>Solving NP-hard Problems on \textsc{GaTEx} Graphs: Linear-Time Algorithms for Perfect Orderings, Cliques, Colorings, and Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of $\mathsf{Ga}$lled-$\mathsf{T}$ree $\mathsf{Ex}$plainable ($\mathsf{GaTEx}$) graphs has recently been discovered as a natural generalization of cographs. Cographs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs are precisely those that can be uniquely represented by a particular rooted acyclic network, called a galled-tree.
  This paper explores the use of galled-trees to solve combinatorial problems on $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs that are, in general, NP-hard. We demonstrate that finding a maximum clique, an optimal vertex coloring, a perfect order, as well as a maximum independent set in $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs can be efficiently done in linear time. The key idea behind the linear-time algorithms is to utilize the galled-trees that explain the $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs as a guide for computing the respective cliques, colorings, perfect orders, or independent sets.</description>

      <title>The capacity of a finite field matrix channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Additive-Multiplicative Matrix Channel (AMMC) was introduced by Silva, Kschischang and K\"otter in 2010 to model data transmission using random linear network coding. The input and output of the channel are $n\times m$ matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On input the matrix $X$, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where $A$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and where $W$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $t$.
  Silva \emph{et al} considered the case when $2n\leq m$. They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when $t$, $n$ and $m$ are fixed and $q\rightarrow\infty$. They also determined the leading term of the capacity when $q$ is fixed, and $t$, $n$ and $m$ grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when $q$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>All You Need is Resistance: On the Equivalence of Effective Resistance and Certain Optimal Transport Problems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>
