      <title>Permutation-Like Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation Matrices are a well known class of matrices which encode the elements of the symmetric group on $d$ elements as a square $d\times d$ matrix. Motivated by [4], we define a similar class of matrices which are a generalization of Permutation Matrices. We give explicit formulas for the multiplication of these matrices. Lastly, we discuss the spectral radius, eigenvalues, and periodicity before giving a form of Birkhoff-Von Neumann's Theorem for Left Stochastic Matrices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-diagrams and gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any gentle algebra $A$ with one maximal path corresponds to a unique quasi-diagram $\alpha$. We introduce the regularity for $\alpha$, and show that $A$ has finite global dimension if and only if $\alpha$ is regular. We characterize regular quasi-diagrams which remain regular under the dihedral group action. We prove that the set of maximal chord diagrams is the "biggest" one among the sets closed under taking Koszul dual and rotations.</description>

      <title>On Williamson's Simultaneous Symplectic Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Williamson's normal form is well known for symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space. In this paper, we consider when two symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space can simultaneously admit a normal form under a common symplectic linear automorphism.</description>

      <title>Classification of modular data of integral modular fusion categories up to rank 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a classification of all integral modular fusion categories' modular data and, more broadly, all integral half-Frobenius fusion rings, up to rank 12. We get that each perfect integral modular fusion category, as well as every perfect integral half-Frobenius fusion ring, up to rank 12, is trivial. Furthermore, we establish that every integral modular fusion category of rank 13 is pointed, up to 2 types in progress. We have also refined the categorifiable non-pointed odd-dimensional modular data at ranks below 25 to three possible items, all of rank 17, FPdim 225, and type [[1,3],[3,8],[5,6]], filling literature potential gaps. For rank 25, we have narrowed down the perfect case to 21 types.
  Our initial key insight is that the Egyptian fractions, which are typically employed to list possible types, can be chosen with squared denominators. We then develop several type criteria as initial filters. Particularly, we establish that the number of distinct basic FPdims in a non-trivial perfect fusion ring must be at least 4. To obtain the fusion rings, we solve the dimension and associativity equations using an updated version of Normaliz designed specifically for this purpose. The S-matrices (if they exist) are obtained by self-transposing the character table, while the T-matrices are derived by solving the Anderson-Moore-Vafa equations. Finally, we verify the extended axioms of modular data.</description>

      <title>Cluster deep loci and mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine cluster varieties are covered up to codimension 2 by open algebraic tori. We put forth a general conjecture (based on earlier conversation between Vivek Shende and the last author) characterizing their deep locus, i.e. the complement of all cluster charts, as the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer under the action of cluster automorphisms. We use the diagrammatics of Demazure weaves to verify the conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster varieties of finite cluster type with arbitrary choice of frozens and for the top open positroid strata of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3,n)$. We illustrate how this already has applications in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, by proving that the Fukaya category of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,2n+1)$ is split-generated by finitely many Lagrangian tori, and homological mirror symmetry holds with a Landau--Ginzburg model proposed by Rietsch. Finally, we study the geometry of the deep locus, and find that it can be singular and have several irreducible components of different dimensions, but they all are again cluster varieties in our examples in really full rank cases.</description>

      <title>Ultimate codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linear block code over a field can be derived from a unit scheme. Looking at codes as structures within a unit scheme greatly extends the availability of linear block and convolutional codes and allows the construction of the codes to required length, rate, distance and type. Properties of a code emanate from properties of the unit from which it was derived. %% can thus be constructed and analysed by designating the units whose properties would give the required codes.
  Orthogonal units, units in group rings, Fourier/Vandermonde units and related units are used to construct and analyse linear block and convolutional codes and to construct these to predefined length, rate, distance and type. Self-dual, dual containing, quantum error-correcting and complementary dual linear block and convolutional codes are constructed.
  Low density parity check linear block and convolutional codes are constructed using group rings and are constructed with no short cycles in the control matrix.
  From a single unit, multiple codes of a required type are derivable.</description>
