      <title>Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.</description>

      <title>Semiflows, Home Spaces, and Home States, Applications to the Analysis of Parameterized Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After rapidly recalling basic notations relatively to semiflows and Petri nets, we define F, the set of semiflows over Z that we associate with a specific class of invariants. We then focus on F+, the set of semiflows with non-negative coordinates which are important to study the behavior of a Petri net. We recall known behavioral properties attached to semiflows in F+ that we associate with two sets of bounds regarding boundedness then liveness. We recall the notions of home states and home spaces for which we regrouped old and new properties. We introduce a new result on the decidability of liveness under the existence of a home state.
  The notions of minimality of semiflows and minimality of supports allow us to define generating sets that are particularly critical to develop an effective analysis of invariants and behavioral properties of Petri nets such as boundedness or even liveness.
  We also recall three known decomposition theorems considering N, Q+, and Q respectively where the decomposition over N is being improved with a necessary and sufficient condition.
  We use the notion the notion of generating sets to show that extremums linked to the set of bounds mentioned here above, are indeed computable by providing their values.
  Two related Petri net modeling arithmetic operations (one of which represents an Euclidean division) illustrate how results on semiflows and home spaces can be methodically used in efficiently analyzing the liveness of the parameterized model and underlining the efficiency brought by the combination of these results.</description>

      <title>On a sequence of Kimberling and its relationship to the Tribonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Clark Kimberling defined an interesting sequence ${\bf B} = 0100101100 \cdots$ of $0$'s and $1$'s by certain inflation rules, and he made a number of conjectures about this sequence and some related ones. In this note we prove his conjectures using, in part, the Walnut theorem-prover. We show how his word is related to the infinite Tribonacci word, and we determine both the subword complexity and critical exponent of $\bf B$.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Generation of Constrained Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-based testing combines context-free grammar definitions with semantic constraints over grammar elements to generate test inputs. By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute.</description>
