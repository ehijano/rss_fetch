      <title>Additional Doppler Monitoring Corroborates HAT-P-11 c as a Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Bakos and collaborators discovered a Neptune-sized planet transiting the K-dwarf HAT-P-11 every five days. Later in 2018, Yee and collaborators reported an additional Jovian-mass companion on a nine year orbit based on a decade of Doppler monitoring. The eccentric outer giant HAT-P-11c may be responsible for the peculiar polar orbit of the inner planet HAT-P-11b. However, Basilicata et al. (2024) recently suggested that the HAT-P-11c Doppler signal could be caused by stellar activity. In this research note, we extend the Yee et al. (2018) Doppler time series by six years. The combined dataset spanning 17 years covers nearly two orbits of the outer planet. Importantly, we observe two periastron passages of planet c and do not observe a coherent activity signature. Together with the previously reported astrometric acceleration of HAT-P-11 from Hipparcos and Gaia, we believe there is strong evidence for HAT-P-11c as a bona fide planet.</description>

      <title>The evolution of Jupiter and Saturn with helium rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation between hydrogen and helium at high pressures and temperatures leads to the rainout of helium in the deep interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. This process, also known as "helium rain", affects their long-term evolution. Therefore, modelling the evolution and internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn (and giant exoplanets) relies on the phase diagram of hydrogen and helium. In this work, we simulate the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn with helium rain by applying different phase diagrams of hydrogen and helium. We find that consistency between Jupiter s evolution and the Galileo measurement of its atmospheric helium abundance is achieved only if a shift in temperature in the existing phase diagrams is applied (-1250 K, +350 K or -3850 K depending on the used phase diagram). We next use the shifted phase diagrams to model Saturn s evolution and find consistent solutions for both planets. We confirm that demixing in Jupiter is modest while in Saturn, the process of helium rain is significant. We find that Saturn has a large helium gradient and a helium ocean. Saturn s atmospheric helium mass fraction is estimated to be between 0.13 and 0.16. We also investigate how the used hydrogen-helium equation of state and atmospheric model affect the planetary evolution and find that the predicted cooling times can change by several hundred million years. Constraining the level of super-adiabaticity in the helium gradient formed in Jupiter and Saturn remains challenging and should be investigated in detail in future research. We conclude that further explorations of the immiscibility between hydrogen and helium are valuable as this knowledge directly affects the evolution and current-state structure of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, we argue that measuring Saturn s atmospheric helium content is crucial for constraining Saturn s evolution as well as the hydrogen-helium phase diagram.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Dayside Spectroscopy of WASP-189b: Detection of Iron during the GHOST/Gemini South System Verification Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With high equilibrium temperatures and tidally locked rotation, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are unique laboratories within which to probe extreme atmospheric physics and chemistry. In this paper, we present high-resolution dayside spectroscopy of the UHJ WASP-189b obtained with the new Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at the Gemini South Observatory. The observations, which cover three hours of post-eclipse orbital phases, were obtained during the instrument's System Verification run. We detect the planet's atmosphere via the Doppler cross-correlation technique, and recover a detection of neutral iron in the planet's dayside atmosphere at a significance of 7.5$\sigma$ in the red-arm of the data, verifying the presence of a thermal inversion. We also investigate the presence of other species in the atmosphere and discuss the implications of model injection/recovery tests. These results represent the first atmospheric characterization of an exoplanet with GHOST's high-resolution mode, and demonstrate the potential of this new instrument in detecting and studying ultra-hot exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Multiple overspill flood channels from young craters require surface melting and hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice late in Mars history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars' tadpole craters are small, young craters whose crater rims are incised by one or more exit breaches but lack visible inlets. The tadpole forming climate records the poorly understood drying of Mars since the Early Hesperian. A third of tadpole craters have multiple breaches, therefore a process is needed that was able to generate crater rim incision in multiple locations. We use HiRISE data for four multiple breach tadpole craters to measure their crater fill, rims, and exit breaches. We compare these measurements and other data to our calculations of liquid water supply by rain, surface melting, groundwater discharge, and basal ice sheet melting to discriminate between four proposed formation hypotheses for tadpole breaches, favoring scenarios with ice-filled craters and supraglacial melting. We conclude that multiple breach tadpole craters record hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice and climate conditions enabling intermittent melting in the Late Hesperian and Amazonian, suggesting that liquid water on Mars has been available in association with water ice for billions of years.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Revisiting the GJ 581 multi-planetary system with new Doppler measurements from CARMENES, HARPS, and HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ 581 is a nearby M dwarf known to host a packed multiple planet system with 2 super-Earths and a Neptune-mass planet. We present new orbital analyses of the system, utilizing recent RV data obtained from the CARMENES spectrograph combined with newly reprocessed archival data from the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. Our aim was to analyze the post-discovery spectroscopic data of GJ 581, which were obtained with CARMENES. In addition, we used publicly available HIRES and HARPS spectroscopic data to seek evidence of the known and disputed exoplanets in this system. We aimed to investigate the stellar activity of GJ 581 and update the planetary system's orbital parameters using state-of-the-art numerical models and techniques. We performed a periodogram analysis of the available precise CARMENES, HIRES, and HARPS RVs and of stellar activity indicators. We conducted detailed orbital analyses by testing various orbital configurations consistent with the RV data. We studied the posterior probability distribution of the parameters fit to the data and explored the long-term stability and overall orbital dynamics of the system. We refined the orbital parameters of the system using the most precise and complete set of Doppler data available. Consistent with the existing literature, we confirm that the system is unequivocally composed of only 3 planets detectable in the present data, dismissing the putative planet GJ 581 d as an artifact of stellar activity. Our N-body fit reveals that the system's inclination is i $=$ 47.0 deg, which implies that the planets could be up to 30% more massive than their previously reported minimum masses. Furthermore, we report that the system exhibits long-term stability, as indicated by the posterior probability distribution, characterized by secular dynamical interactions without the involvement of mean motion resonances.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Grand Tack in Exoplanetary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grand Tack model, more generally called the Masset &amp; Snellgrove mechanism, is a planetary migration model whereby two giant planets conspired with their natal disk to migrate to larger orbital radii. While its relevance in our own Solar System remains in question, the fact that the Masset &amp; Snellgrove mechanism is a general hydrodynamical effect implies that it may have occured in another planetary system. In this letter I search through the exoplanet data for evidence of the Masset &amp; Snellgrove mechanism which requires (1) the inner of two planets is more massive than the outer planet; (2) the planets are sufficiently massive that their gravity-induced gap overlap; and (3) they orbit at sufficiently close radii that their co-rotation regions also overlap. These last two requirements are met when the planet's orbit with a 3:2 mean motion resonance. I do not find conclusive evidence for a Grand Tack-like system, but find some evidence for planet formation at the edge of a planet-induced protoplanetary disk gap in three systems.</description>

      <title>Toward an efficient second-order method for computing the surface gravitational potential on spherical-polar meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical accretion discs that carry a significant mass compared with their central object are subject to the effect of self-gravity. In the context of circumstellar discs, this can, for instance, cause fragmentation of the disc gas, and -- under suitable conditions -- lead to the direct formation of gas-giant planets. If one wants to study these phenomena, the disc's gravitational potential needs to be obtained by solving the Poisson equation. This requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. In the case of a spherical-polar computational mesh, a standard multipole expansion for obtaining boundary values is not practicable. We hence compare two alternative methods for overcoming this limitation. The first method is based on a known Green's function expansion (termed "CCGF") of the potential, while the second (termed "James' method") uses a surface screening mass approach with a suitable discrete Green's function. We demonstrate second-order convergence for both methods and test the weak scaling behaviour when using thousands of computational cores. Overall, James' method is found superior owing to its favourable algorithmic complexity of $\sim \mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compared with the $\sim\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ scaling of the CCGF method.</description>

      <title>Tracking Advanced Planetary Systems (TAPAS) with HARPS-N VIII. A wide-orbit planetary companion in the hot-Jupiter system HD 118203</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star HD 118203, classified as a K0 subgiant, was known to harbour a transiting hot Jupiter planet on a 6.1-day eccentric orbit. Previous studies also revealed a linear trend in the radial velocity (RV) domain, indicative of a companion on a wide orbit. Such a hierarchical orbital architecture could be helpful in studies of the origins of hot Jupiters. We acquired precise RV measurements over 17 years using the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope and the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Combining these observations with space-born photometric time series from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we constructed a two-planetary model for the system. Astrometric observations from Hipparcos and Gaia were used to constrain the orbital inclination of the wide-orbit companion and its mass. Numerical simulations were used to investigate the dynamics of the system. The photometric data were searched for additional transit-like flux drops. We found that the additional companion is an 11-Jupiter mass planet orbiting HD 118203 on a 14-year moderately eccentric orbit, constituting a hierarchical planetary system with the hot Jupiter. Both planets were found to be dynamically decoupled mainly due to the general relativistic apsidal precession of the inner planet, marginalising secular interactions. The orbits of both planets might have a relatively low mutual inclination unless the longitudes of the ascending node differ substantially. This configuration favours the coplanar high-eccentricity migration as a path to the present-day orbital configuration. No other transiting planets with radii down to 2 Earth radii and orbital periods less than 100 days were found in the system.</description>

      <title>Fate of a remnant solid disk around an eccentric giant planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of giant planets' atmospheres is an important tracer of their formation history. While many theoretical studies investigate the heavy-element accretion within a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the possibility of solid accretion after disk dissipation has not been explored. Here, we focus on the case of a gas giant planet excited to an eccentric orbit and assess the likelihood of solid accretion after disk dissipation. We perform N-body simulations of planetesimals and embryos around an eccentric giant planet. We consider various sizes and orbits for the eccentric planet and determine the fate of planetesimals and embryos. We find that the orbital evolution of solids, such as planetesimals and embryos, is regulated by weak encounters with the eccentric planet rather than strong close encounters. Even in the region where the Safronov number is smaller than unity, most solid materials fall onto the central star or are ejected from the planetary system. We also develop an analytical model of the solid accretion along the orbital evolution of a giant planet, where the accretion probability is obtained as a function of the planetary mass, radius, semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and solid disk thickness. Our model predicts that $\sim$0.01-0.1 $M_\oplus$ of solids is accreted onto an eccentric planet orbiting in the outer disk ($\sim10$ au). The accreted heavy-element mass increases (decreases) with the eccentricity (inclination) of the planet. We also discuss the possibility of collisions of terrestrial planets and find that $\sim10\%$ of the hot Jupiters formed via high-eccentric migration collide with a planet of $10M_\oplus$. However, we find that solid accretion and collisions with terrestrial planets are minor events for planets in the inner orbit, and a different accretion process is required to enrich eccentric giant planets with heavy elements.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Phase Law and Light Curve of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curve of comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS peaked in mid-April 2024, which nearly coincided with a minimum phase angle of 2.9 deg. The question of a possible correlation between the two events has implications for the comet's overall performance. In this note I examine the light curve at times of equal phase angles to circumvent the effect and show that the comet was as bright intrinsically in late March as it was in early May. From a plot of the comet's magnitude at unit geocentric distance against the phase angle before and after its minimum on 18 April I derive a very steep phase law and a relatively flat, r^(-2.55) light curve failing to fit the recently reported magnitudes. After stalling in May and June, the comet's activity enters another surge (at a time of peak phase effect), as fragmentation continues.</description>

Abstract: Euler-Poisson equations belong to the class of first-order differential equations for determining the integral lines of a given vector field. The general solution to these equations can be written as a power series of the evolution parameter. We calculated the sum of these series for the case of a free symmetric body, obtaining its rotation matrix through the elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Precise and Efficient Orbit Prediction in LEO with Machine Learning using Exogenous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume of space objects in Earth's orbit presents a significant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular, accurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of space objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When performing Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the SGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are able to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine learning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision ephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the period of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and time-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low computational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing faster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space objects.</description>

      <title>The future looks dark: improving high contrast imaging with hyper-parameter optimization for data-driven predictive wavefront control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets requires extreme adaptive optics (XAO), achieving exquisite wavefront correction (upwards of 90$\%$ Strehl) over a narrow field of view (a few arcseconds). For these XAO systems the temporal error is often a leading term in the error budget, wherein the wavefront evolves faster than the lag between wavefront sensing and control. For atmospheres with high-velocity wind layers, this can result in a wind-driven halo in the coronagraphic dark-zone, limiting sensitivity to faint, close-in companions. The AO system's lag-time is often limited by the wavefront sensor exposure time, especially in the case of fainter guidestars. Predictive control mitigates the temporal error by predicting the shape of the wavefront by time the system correction is applied. One such method of prediction is empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), wherein previous states in the wavefront sensor history are used to learn linear correlations with a minimization problem. This method has been demonstrated on-sky at Subaru/SCExAO and Keck/NIRC2, but has yet to be optimized. With this work as a starting point, we explore the optimal filter hyper-parameter space for implementing EOF on-sky, study its stability under varying atmospheric parameters, and discuss future paths for facilitization of predictive control. This work not only offers a pathway to optimize Keck and Subaru observing, but also acts as a pathfinder for predictive control methods with extremely large telescopes.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>An extended low-density atmosphere around the Jupiter-sized planet WASP-193 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08350</link>

Abstract: Gas giants transiting bright nearby stars provide crucial insights into planetary system formation and evolution mechanisms. Most of these planets exhibit certain average characteristics, serving as benchmarks for our understanding of planetary systems. However, outliers like the planet we present in this study, WASP-193b, offer unique opportunities to explore unconventional formation and evolution processes. This planet completes an orbit around its Vmag=12.2 F9 main-sequence host star every 6.25 d. Our analyses found that WASP-193b has a mass of Mp=0.139+/-0.029 MJup and a radius of Rp=1.464+/-0.058 RJup, translating into an extremely low density of rho_p = 0.059+/-0.014 g/cm^3, at least one order of magnitude less than standard gas giants like Jupiter. Typical gas giants such as Jupiter have densities that range between 0.2 and 2 g/cm^3. The combination of its large transit depth (dF~1.4%), its extremely-low density, its high-equilibrium temperature (Teq = 1254+/-31 K), and the infrared brightness of its host star (magnitude Kmag=10.7) makes WASP-193b an exquisite target for characterization by transmission spectroscopy (transmission spectroscopy metric: TSM~600). One single JWST transit observation would yield detailed insights into its atmospheric properties and planetary mass, providing a unique window to explore the mechanisms behind its exceptionally low density and shed light on giant planets' diverse nature.</description>

      <title>Photoevaporation from Inner Protoplanetary Disks Confronted with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decades-long explorations on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks involve many debates about photoevaporation versus magnetized wind launching mechanisms. This letter argues that the observed winds originating from the inner disk ($R\lesssim 0.3$ AU) cannot be explained by the photoevaporative mechanism. Energy conservation requires the presumed photoevaporative winds to be heated to $\gtrsim 10^5$ K when launched from inner disks. However, due to efficient thermal accommodation with dust grains and cooling processes at high densities, X-ray irradiation at energies above 1 keV cannot efficiently launch winds in the first place because of its high penetration. Some studies claiming X-ray wind launching have oversimplified the thermochemical couplings. Furthermore, heating the gas to escape velocity will over-ionize it, suppressing the species responsible for observed forbidden lines (e.g., [OI] 6300 $\r{A}$ ). Confirmed by semi-analytic integrations of thermochemical fluid structures, such high ionizations contradict the observed emission of neutral and singly-ionized atoms from the winds originating from the inner disks.</description>

      <title>The atmospheric composition of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178 b observed with ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for atmospheric constituents for the UHJ WASP-178 b with two ESPRESSO transits using the narrow-band and cross-correlation techniques, focusing on the detections of NaI, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, MgI, FeI and FeII. Additionally, we show parallel photometry used to obtain updated and precise stellar, planetary and orbital parameters. We report the resolved line detections of NaI (5.5 and 5.4 $\sigma$), H$\alpha$ (13 $\sigma$), H$\beta$ (7.1 $\sigma$), and tentatively MgI (4.6 $\sigma$). In cross-correlation, we confirm the MgI detection (7.8 and 5.8 $\sigma$) and additionally report the detections of FeI (12 and 10 $\sigma$) and FeII (11 and 8.4 $\sigma$), on both nights separately. The detection of MgI remains tentative, however, due to the differing results between both nights, as well as compared with the narrow-band derived properties. None of our resolved spectral lines probing the mid- to upper atmosphere show significant shifts relative to the planetary rest frame, however H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit line broadenings of 39.6 $\pm$ 2.1 km/s and 27.6 $\pm$ 4.6 km/s, respectively, indicating the onset of possible escape. WASP-178 b differs from similar UHJ with its lack of strong atmospheric dynamics in the upper atmosphere, however the broadening seen for FeI (15.66 $\pm$ 0.58 km/s) and FeII (11.32 $\pm$ 0.52 km/s) could indicate the presence of winds in the mid-atmosphere. Future studies on the impact of the flux variability caused by the host star activity might shed more light on the subject. Previous work indicated the presence of SiO cloud-precursors in the atmosphere of WASP-178 b and a lack of MgI and FeII. However, our results suggest that a scenario where the planetary atmosphere is dominated by MgI and FeII is more likely. In light of our results, we encourage future observations to further elucidate these atmospheric properties.</description>

      <title>Satellite Drag Analysis During the May 2024 Gannon Geomagnetic Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between May 10-12, 2024, Earth saw its largest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years. Since the last major storm in 2003, the population of satellites in low Earth orbit has surged following the commercialization of space services and the ongoing establishment of proliferated LEO constellations. In this note, we investigate the various impacts of the geomagnetic storm on satellite operations. A forecast performance assessment of the geomagnetic index ap shows that the magnitude and duration of the storm were poorly predicted, even one day in advance. Total mass density enhancements in the thermosphere are identified by tracking satellite drag decay characteristics. A history of two-line element (TLE) data from the entire NORAD catalog in LEO is used to observe large-scale trends. Better understanding how geomagnetic storms impact satellite operations is critical for maintaining satellite safety and ensuring long-term robust sustainability in LEO.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>
