      <title>Organic electrochemical neurons and synapses with ion mediated spiking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future brain-machine interfaces, prosthetics, and intelligent soft robotics will require integrating artificial neuromorphic devices with biological systems. Due to their poor biocompatibility, circuit complexity, low energy efficiency, and operating principles fundamentally different from the ion signal modulation of biology, traditional Silicon-based neuromorphic implementations have limited bio-integration potential. Here, we report the first organic electrochemical neurons (OECNs) with ion-modulated spiking, based on allprinted complementary organic electrochemical transistors. We demonstrate facile biointegration of OECNs with Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) to induce lobe closure upon input stimuli. The OECNs can also be integrated with all-printed organic electrochemical synapses (OECSs), exhibiting short-term plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and longterm plasticity with retention &gt;1000 s, facilitating Hebbian learning. These soft and flexible OECNs operate below 0.6 V and respond to multiple stimuli, defining a new vista for localized artificial neuronal systems possible to integrate with bio-signaling systems of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based Magnetic Resonance Simultaneous Multislice Imaging Using Holographic Image Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a one of the acceleration technique of magnetic resonance imaging. SMS requires accurate sensitivity distributions in the slice plane for each receiving coil. This requirement is difficult to satisfy in practice, limiting the applications of this imaging technique. Here, images are reconstructed by applying deep learning and amplitude modulation to each slice image. Simulation experiments show that image reconstruction can be achieved for both real- and complex-valued images. Image quality tends to decrease with increasing number of simultaneously acquired images. It is also shown that a larger difference in the phase modulation coefficients between slices tends to increase the quality of the reconstructed images. Simulation experiments and initial MR imaging experiments show promising results for this method.</description>

      <title>Assessing Bilateral Neurovascular Bundles Function with Pulsed Wave Doppler Ultrasound: Implications for Reducing Erectile Dysfunction Following Prostate Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the functional status of bilateral neurovascular bundles (NVBs) using pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound in patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy (RT). Sixty-two patients (mean age: 66.1 +/- 7.2 years) underwent transrectal ultrasound scan using a conventional ultrasound scanner, a 7.5 MHz bi-plane probe and a mechanical stepper. The ultrasound protocol comprised 3 steps: 1) 3D B-mode scans of the entire prostate, 2) localization of NVBs using color flow Doppler imaging, and 3) measurement of NVB function using pulsed wave Doppler. Five pulsed Doppler waveform features were extracted: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), mean velocity (Vm), resistive index (RI), and pulsatile index (PI). In summary, this study presents a Doppler evaluation of NVBs in patients undergoing prostate RT. It highlights substantial differences in Doppler ultrasound waveform features between bilateral NVBs. The proposed ultrasound method may prove valuable as clinicians strive to deliver NVB-sparing RT to preserve sexual function effectively and enhance patients' overall well-being.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Array Encoding for Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The transmit encoding model for synthetic aperture imaging is a robust and flexible framework for understanding the effect of acoustic transmission on ultrasound image reconstruction. Our objective is to use machine learning (ML) to construct scanning sequences, parameterized by time delays and apodization weights, that produce high quality B-mode images. Approach: We use an ML model in PyTorch and simulated RF data from Field II to probe the space of possible encoding sequences for those that minimize a loss function that describes image quality. This approach is made computationally feasible by a novel formulation of the derivative for delay-and-sum beamforming. We demonstrate these results experimentally on wire targets and a tissue-mimicking phantom. Main Results: When trained according to a given set of imaging parameters (imaging domain, hardware restrictions), our ML imaging model produces optimized encoding sequences that improve a number of standard quality metrics including resolution, field of view, and contrast, over conventional sequences. Significance: This work demonstrates that the set of encoding schemes that are commonly used represent only a narrow subset of those available. Additionally, it demonstrates the value for ML tasks in synthetic transmit aperture imaging to consider the beamformer within the model, instead of as purely post-processing.</description>

      <title>List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Dykstra-Like Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To converge the block iterative method in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET), careful control of relaxation parameters is required, which is a challenging task. The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach than controlling relaxation parameters would be desired by list-mode PET reconstruction. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. We evaluated LM-MLDS using simulation and clinical data. LM-MLDS provided a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and suppressed an oscillation of tradeoff curves between noise and contrast than the other block iterative methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. LM-MLDS showed different noise properties than the other methods due to Gaussian denoising induced by the proximity operator. The list-mode proximal splitting PET reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferentiable functions such as total variation but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters.</description>

      <title>Spiral wave dynamics in a neuronal network model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral waves are spatial-temporal patterns that can emerge in different systems as heart tissues, chemical oscillators, ecological networks and the brain. These waves have been identified in the neocortex of turtles, rats, and humans, particularly during sleep-like states. Although their functions in cognitive activities remain until now poorly understood, these patterns are related to cortical activity modulation and contribute to cortical processing. In this work, we construct a neuronal network layer based on the spatial distribution of pyramidal neurons. Our main goal is to investigate how local connectivity and coupling strength are associated with the emergence of spiral waves. Therefore, we propose a trustworthy method capable of detecting different wave patterns, based on local and global phase order parameters. As a result, we find that the range of connection radius (R) plays a crucial role in the appearance of spiral waves. For R &lt; 20 {\mu}m, only asynchronous activity is observed due to small number of connections. The coupling strength (gsyn ) greatly influences the pattern transitions for higher R, where spikes and bursts firing patterns can be observed in spiral and non-spiral waves. Finally, we show that for some values of R and gsyn bistable states of wave patterns are obtained.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or N\'eel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous MPI sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.</description>
