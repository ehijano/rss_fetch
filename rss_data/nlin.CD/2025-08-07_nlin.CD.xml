      <title>Forecasting chaotic dynamic using hybrid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature is rich with studies, analyses, and examples on parameter estimation for describing the evolution of chaotic dynamical systems based on measurements, even when only partial information is available through observations.
  However, parameter estimation alone does not resolve prediction challenges, particularly when only a subset of variables is known or when parameters are estimated with significant uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid system specifically designed to address this issue. The method involves training an artificial intelligent system to predict the dynamics of a measured system by combining a neural network with a simulated system. By training the neural network, it becomes possible to refine the model's predictions so that the simulated dynamics synchronize with the actual system dynamics.
  After a brief contextualization of the problem, we introduce the hybrid approach employed, describing the learning technique and testing the results on two chaotic systems inspired by atmospheric dynamics in measurement contexts. Although these systems are low-dimensional, they encompass all the fundamental characteristics and predictability challenges that can be observed in more complex real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Gradient of the Adiabatic Gauge Potential in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) is the generator of unitary transformations which preserve the eigenbasis of a quantum Hamiltonian under parametric variation. While its usefulness in quantum mechanics has been thoroughly demonstrated in recent years, less attention has been given to its behavior in classical systems, where the AGP is a phase space function and its gradient defines special canonical transformations. In this paper we propose an efficient method to compute the gradient of the AGP as a classical function. We demonstrate that the obtained canonical transformation reproduces expected results for simple orbits and integrable systems for which the adiabatic limit is well-defined. In chaotic systems the gradient diverges in a way that is related to Lyapunov times.</description>

      <title>Extreme Event Precursor Prediction in Turbulent Dynamical Systems via CNN-Augmented Recurrence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to predict precursors to extreme events in turbulent dynamical systems. The approach combines phase-space reconstruction techniques with recurrence matrices and convolutional neural networks to identify precursors to extreme events. We evaluate the framework across three distinct testbed systems: a triad turbulent interaction model, a prototype stochastic anisotropic turbulent flow, and the Kolmogorov flow. This method offers three key advantages: (1) a threshold-free classification strategy that eliminates subjective parameter tuning, (2) efficient training using only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ recurrence matrices, and (3) ability to generalize to unseen systems. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance across all test systems: 96\% detection rate for the triad model with a mean lead time of 1.8 time units, 96\% for the anisotropic turbulent flow with a mean lead time of 6.1 time units, and 93\% for the Kolmogorov flow with a mean lead time of 22.7 units.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Bifurcations in Stochastic Non-Normal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01833v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While bifurcations have been widely recognized as important drivers of abrupt surges and transient extremes in complex systems, we propose a complementary and more universally applicable framework rooted in non-normal dynamics. We demonstrate that linear or nearly linear stochastic systems near a dynamical attractor can exhibit transiently repulsive dynamics -- termed pseudo-bifurcations -- when their interacting components are sufficiently asymmetric and hierarchically organized, that is, when the system is non-normal. The term `pseudo' reflects the central role of the pseudospectrum in non-normal operators, whose positive pseudo-eigenvalues quantify these transient unstable regimes despite the system's asymptotic stability. These pseudo-bifurcations produce early-warning signals commonly linked to bifurcations, such as dimension reduction, critical slowing down, and increased variance. Furthermore, we show that non-normal transients systematically emerge well before actual bifurcations occur, complicating their distinction and potentially introducing a bias that makes the system appear much closer to a critical point than it truly is. We support our analytical derivations with numerical simulations and by empirically demonstrating that the brain exhibits clear signs of such non-normal transients during epileptic seizures. Many systems suspected of approaching critical bifurcation points should be reconsidered, as non-normal dynamics offer a more generic explanation for the observed phenomena across natural, physical, and social systems.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>

      <title>A class of 2x2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.</description>
