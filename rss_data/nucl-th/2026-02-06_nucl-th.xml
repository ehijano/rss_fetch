      <title>Neglecting correlations leads to misestimated model errors in EFT predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian analyses of the convergence pattern of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) enable estimation of the uncertainty induced by a truncated expansion. When an EFT that has been calibrated to data is used to make a prediction this truncation uncertainty enters the posterior predictive distribution twice: directly from the finite-order calculation of the predicted quantity and indirectly through the posterior probability distributions of the EFT low-energy constants (LECs) determined by the calibration. In this work, we focus on the interplay of these two sources of uncertainty. We do this in the context of a toy EFT that we fit to pseudodata and use to make predictions. Direct EFT truncation uncertainty and LEC uncertainty are correlated in predictions when the predicted quantity is correlated with the observables used to fit the LECs. Here this results in the overall theoretical uncertainty in the EFT prediction being smaller than either the uncertainty induced by the truncation error or that stemming from the LECs alone.</description>

      <title>Decay of three-body resonances in a discrete basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for calculating the asymptotic properties and decay dynamics of three-body resonances described in a discrete basis. The method involves solving an inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation to determine the non-normalizable resonant state by identifying a normalizable source state, which captures the short-range internal structure. The long-range behavior is then calculated using the free three-body propagator, providing accurate asymptotic coefficients necessary for describing decay correlations. We apply this formalism to the two-neutron decay of the 0$^{+}$ ground-state and the 2$^{+}$ excited-state resonances of $^{16}\text{Be}$ ($^{14}\text{Be}+n+n$), working within the hyperspherical expansion method with an analytical transformed harmonic oscillator basis. Our results show that the decay is strongly dominated by the lowest hypermomentum components at large separations, reflecting effective three-body barrier penetration dynamics that shape the final state. The calculated relative-energy distributions exhibit clear neutron-neutron correlations for both states, arising from mixing between different asymptotic channels, and are consistent with a direct two-neutron emission mechanism, in agreement with recent experimental observations. This work provides a reliable tool for linking the internal structure of three-body resonances to their decay properties.</description>

      <title>Three-body Effect in Short-range Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range correlations (SRCs) provide the link between low- and high-energy nuclear physics and can be quantified by two-nucleon densities. We present calculations of the two-nucleon densities using free-space similarity renormalization group (SRG)-evolved operators and in-medium SRG (IMSRG) ground states with softend chiral interaction. Our calculations benchmark well against no-core shell model (NCSM) results with unevolved oparetors and Hamiltonians in $^4\mathrm{He}$. We explicitly include the induced three-body (3b) density operators for the first time which, together with the 3b Hamiltonians, provide the full 3b effects. We show pronounced 3b effects in the $^{16}\mathrm{O}$ two-nucleon densities. Combined with valence-space IMSRG (VS-IMSRG) method, we extend the calculation to the oxygen isotopic chain. This approach enables a consistent \textit{ab initio} description of low-energy properties and SRCs within one framework and offers predictions for the upcoming SRC measurements in unstable nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic chemical potentials across the (hyper)nuclear landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite nuclei constrain the dense-matter equation of state (EOS), yet they are self-bound quantum droplets far from the thermodynamic limit. Motivated by an analogy to quantum dots, we show that the nuclear chart nevertheless defines a mesoscopic regime in which mesoscopic chemical-potential analogs $\{\mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S\}$ can be extracted directly from nuclear and hypernuclear binding energies after consistent Coulomb subtraction. These are discrete finite-difference response functions -- local slopes of the strong-interaction energy landscape -- not equilibrium grand-canonical chemical potentials. The nuclear chart itself supplies an "ensemble of nearby droplets": finite differences across neighboring nuclei suppress shell- and pairing-scale oscillations while retaining the smooth bulk trend, producing robust slopes without a macroscopic limit. Thus, the data provide empirical local derivatives that any strangeness-enabled EOS must reproduce near saturation. Mapping the measured (hyper)nuclear landscape at $T\simeq 0$, we find smooth, numerically stable responses, including a large, negative strangeness chemical-potential analog, and we identify specific hypernuclear measurements that can directly test and sharpen these EOS constraints.</description>

      <title>Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.</description>

      <title>Influence of Non-extensivity on the drag and diffusion coefficients of hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the drag and diffusion coefficients of various hadrons propagating through a hadronic thermal bath by employing the Fokker Planck equation within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\Gamma$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Conformal Limit at Finite Density: Insights from Effective Models and Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss recent results obtained with the application of the medium separation scheme (MSS) in different contexts where a clear violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound at finite density has been observed in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We analyze several scenarios, including QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity. Whenever possible, we compare our findings with lattice QCD (LQCD) results, showing that the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model combined with the MSS provides a consistent description across different regimes of the QCD phase diagram. Our analysis highlights how effective models, when properly regularized, can capture essential nonperturbative features of dense QCD matter, offering complementary insights to lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical treatment of bottomonium suppression and regeneration in $p+{\rm Pb}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bottomonium suppression in $p+ {\rm Pb}$ relative to $p+p$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 5.02$ and 8.16~TeV. Specifically, we combine cold nuclear matter effects (nuclear modifications of the parton densities, energy loss and momentum broadening) with those from hot nuclear matter (suppression and regeneration) by implementing the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in hydrodynamic simulations. Bottomonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma is evaluated semiclassically, employing two different reaction rates. The first includes quasi-free inelastic scattering and gluo-dissociation employing a perturbative coupling to the medium. The second is based on in-medium $T$-matrix calculations where the input potential is constrained by lattice quantum chromodynamics to extract the bottomonium masses and dissociation rates. These semiclassical results are compared to previous calculations in an open quantum systems approach and to the experimental data. Predictions for $\chi_b$ suppression at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$~TeV are also presented.</description>

      <title>Closer look at enhanced three-nucleon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent publication, Cirigliano {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 022501 (2025)] argue that three-nucleon forces (3NFs) involving short-range operators that couple two pions with two nucleons are enhanced beyond what is expected in chiral effective field theory based on naive dimensional analysis. Here, we scrutinize the arguments and conclusions of that paper by taking into account renormalization scheme dependence of the corresponding low-energy constants. We gain further insights into the expected impact of these 3NFs by comparing them with contributions of similar type, induced by pion-exchange diagrams at lower orders in the chiral expansion. We also estimate the impact of these 3NFs on properties of nuclear matter. After removal of scheme-dependent short-distance components in pion loops, the 3NFs considered by Cirigliano {\it et al.} are shown to yield reasonably small contributions to the equation of state of neutron and symmetric nuclear matter in agreement with expectations based on Weinberg's power counting.</description>

      <title>Potential of constraining the Fifth Force Using the Earth as a Spin and Mass Source from space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment in a low Earth orbit spacecraft and using the Earth a spin and mass source to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{Z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. The high speed of the low Earth orbit spacecraft can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity enables efficient extraction of signals from background noise, thereby improving the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, we demonstrate theoretically that the novel Spacecraft-Earth model can improve existing bounds on these exotic interactions by up to three orders of magnitude, using the China Space Station (CSS) as a representative low-Earth-orbit carrier. Such a model, if successfully implemented, may provide an innovative strategy for detecting ultralight dark matter and yield tighter constraints on certain coupling constants of exotic interactions.</description>

      <title>Single pion-production and pion propagation in Achilles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the applicability of Achilles (A CHIcagoLand Lepton Event Simulator) by incorporating the single-pion production mechanism in a fully exclusive fashion. The electroweak interaction vertex is modeled by combining the state-of-the-art Dynamical Coupled-Channels approach with realistic hole spectral functions, which account for correlations in both the initial target state and the residual spectator system. Final-state interactions are treated using a semi-classical intranuclear cascade that leverages nuclear configurations to determine the correlated spatial distribution of protons and neutrons. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes used in the cascade are computed within the Dynamical Coupled-Channels framework, consistent with the electroweak vertex. To model pion absorption, we employ the optical potential approach of Oset and Salcedo. As an alternative approach, we explicitly model the production and propagation of resonances which mediate pion-nucleon scattering and pion absorption. We validate out approach against pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus scattering data, and present comparisons with electron- and neutrino-nucleus measurements from e4$\nu$, T2K, MINER$\nu$A, and MicroBooNE.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>
