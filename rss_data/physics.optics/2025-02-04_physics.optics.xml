      <title>Optical-Theorem-Based Holography For Target Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robust, real-time optical methods for the detection and tracking of particles in complex multiple scattering media is a problem of practical importance in a number of fields, including environmental monitoring, air quality assessment, and homeland security. In this paper we develop a holographic, optical-theorem-based method for the detection of particles embedded in complex environments where wavefronts undergo strong multiple scattering. The proposed methodology is adaptive, to the complex medium, which is integral to the sensing apparatus, and thereby enables constant monitoring, through progressive adaptation. This feature, along with the holographic nature of the developed approach, also renders as a by-product real-time imaging capabilities for the continuous tracking of particles traversing the region under surveillance. In addition, the proposed methodology also enables the development of customized sensors that leverage a controllable complex multiple scattering medium and the derived holographic sensing technology for real-time particle detection and tracking. We demonstrate, with the help of realistic computer simulations, holographic techniques capable of detecting and tracking small particles under such conditions and analyze the role of multiple scattering in enhancing the detection performance. Potential applications include the identification of aerosolized biological substances, which is critical for biosecurity and the rapid detection of hazardous airborne particles in confined or densely populated areas.</description>

      <title>Multiple Temporal Compression as a method to control the generation of bright and dark solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently published works have shown that the Multiple Temporal Compression (MTC) method is a more efficient approach for generation of multiple bright solitons in stacked waveguides, in comparison to the traditional soliton-fission technique. In the present paper, we performed systematic computer simulations of the appropriate generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to extend the MTC method for generation of dark solitons through controlled interactions of bright solitons in waveguiding systems with the normal group-velocity dispersion. Further, the generated dark solitons are demonstrated to be useful for accurately governing the dynamics of bright solitons generation in complex systems based on stacked waveguides. Therefore, we report scenarios that provide mitigation or switching of the energy transfer during bright-soliton collisions, along with the ability of the cascaded MTC processes to increase the number of the generated solitons. These results underscore the potential of the MTC as a versatile method for managing the propagation dynamics of multiple temporal bright and dark solitons produced by a single input pulse, with possible applications for the design of optical devices.</description>

      <title>Flexible delivery of high-power picosecond laser in purely-single optical mode of anti-resonant hollow-core fiber for micromachining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the flexible delivery of picosecond laser pulses with up to 20 W average power over a 3-m-long sample of anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (AR-HCF) for laser micromachining applications. Our experiments highlight the importance of optical mode purity of the AR-HCF for the manufacturing precision. We demonstrate that compared with an AR-HCF sample with a capillary to core (d/D) ratio of ~0.5, the AR-HCF with a d/D ratio of ~0.68 exhibits better capability of high-order-mode suppression, giving rise to improved micromachining quality. Moreover, the AR-HCF delivery system exhibits better pointing stability and set-up flexibility than the free-space beam delivery system. These results pave the way to practical applications of AR-HCF in developing advanced equipment for ultrafast laser micromachining.</description>

      <title>Can 2D materials enable passively $Q$-switched lasers in the nanoscale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving compact on-chip pulsed lasers with attractive performance metrics and compatibility with the silicon photonics platform is an important, yet elusive, goal in contemporary nanophotonics. Here, the fundamental question of whether 2D materials can be utilized as both gain and saturable absorption media to enable compact integrated passively Q-switched nanophotonic lasers is posed and addressed by examining a broad range of 2D material families. The study is conducted by developing a temporal coupled-mode theory framework involving semi-classical rate equations that is capable of rigorously handling gain and saturable absorption by 2D materials, allowing to perform stability and bifurcation analysis covering broad parameter spaces. The range of pulse-train metrics (repetition rate, pulse width, peak power) that can be obtained via different 2D materials is thoroughly assessed. Our work illustrates that nanophotonic cavities enhanced with 2D materials can enable passive Q-switching with repetition rates ranging up to 50~GHz, short pulse duration down to few picoseconds, and peak power exceeding several milliwatts. Such attractive metrics, along with the ultrathin nature of 2D materials and the ability to electrically tune their properties, demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform for compact and flexible integrated laser sources.</description>

      <title>Star-shaped nanostructure-based multifunctional chiral metasurface for near-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we reported, for the first time, a chiral metasurface with multifunctional capabilities tailored for the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range, garnering tremendous interest in applications such as optical communication and chiral sensing. The structure comprised star and bar-shaped silver antennas immersed in SiO2. In computational simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method, the proposed architecture yielded a maximum circular dichroism of 0.7 at 971.5 nm wavelength and a maximum asymmetric transmission under linearly polarized excitation of 0.92 at 1020 nm wavelength. Moreover, this multifunctional structure manifested near-perfect cross-polarization conversions for both linear and circular polarizations, as well as linear to circular and elliptical polarization conversion effects at different bands within the NIR spectral region. The enhanced light-matter interaction of the proposed structure was utilized to detect and differentiate two enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol, yielding excellent chirality sensing capability. As a multifunctional compact chiral platform, the proposed structure is expected to find direct applications in integrated and miniaturized multi-channel optical communication platforms, materials and biomolecules sensing in attomolar concentrations, and the pharmaceutical industry.</description>

      <title>Integrated plasmo-photonic sensor with voltage controled detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a waveguide-integrated interferometric sensor in which interference occurs between two plasmonic modes propagating in a single plasmonic waveguide. For the purpose of sensing, the vertical plasmonic slot waveguide was rearranged by increasing the distance between the metal electrodes. Consequently, the plasmonic modes associated with each metal electrode have been separated, enabling them to propagate independently on opposing edges of metal electrodes what allows for the implementation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The metal electrodes that support the plasmonic modes can also function as electrical contacts. By applying a DC voltage between them, it is possible to efficiently separate ions that drift to one of the metal electrodes. Consequently, any change in a transmission from the interferometer refers only to the amount of ions in a liquid as the output signal from the interferometer is normalized to a liquid by the reference arm which is in direct contact with the examined liquid solution. The total amount of ions in the examined liquid remains constant, however, what changes is their distribution in the gap as the ions drift toward one of the metal electrodes when a voltage is applied. The proposed configuration is highly sensitive to variations in transmission between the two arms of the interferometer, enabling a record sensitivity of over 12460 nm/RIU, even at the telecom wavelength of 1550 nm. A further enhancement in sensitivity is expected in the mid-infrared wavelengths, which correspond to the maximum absorption peaks of most chemical and biological compounds.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electrical control of dipolaritonic circuits with a few femto-joul per bit power consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require on-chip, ultrafast, compact, and energy-efficient components in a scalable platform to power technologies like quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here we present a significant advancement in ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear hybrid light-matter quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device, that was shown to perform as an optical transistor with an optical switching power as low as $\sim$1 fJ/operation, achieves a GHz-rate electrical modulation with a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Nodal lines in a honeycomb plasmonic crystal with synthetic spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a plasmonic model on a honeycomb lattice of metallic nanodisks that hosts nodal lines protected by local symmetries. Using both continuum and tight-binding models, we show that a combination of a synthetic time-reversal symmetry, inversion symmetry, and particle-hole symmetry enforce the existence of nodal lines enclosing the $\mathrm{K}$ and $\mathrm{K}'$ points. The nodal lines are not directly gapped even when these symmetries are weakly broken. The existence of the nodal lines is verified using full-wave electromagnetic simulations. We also show that the degeneracies at nodal lines can be relieved by introducing a Kekul\'e distortion that acts to mix the nodal lines near the $\mathrm{K},\mathrm{K}'$ points. Our findings open pathways for designing novel plasmonic and photonic devices without reliance on complex symmetry engineering, presenting a convenient platform for studying nodal structures in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of shape- and topology-optimized optical cavities with deep sub-wavelength confinement for interfacing with colloidal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a combined shape- and topology-optimization strategy to design manufacturable two-dimensional photonic crystal-based optical nanocavities that confine light to length scales well below the resonance wavelength. We present details of the design strategy as well as scanning electron micrographs of the fabricated indium phosphide cavities with a compact footprint of ~"4.5{\lambda}*4.5{\lambda}" , which feature gaps on the order of 10 nm and theoretical mode volumes in the gap center below (0.1 ({\lambda}/2n_air))^3. Subsequent optical characterization of the far-field emission as well as Purcell-enhanced photoluminescence from the cavities with and without spin-coated colloidal quantum dots are compared to numerical simulations. The results corroborate the potential of the design strategy and fabrication process for ensuring high yield and reliable performance as well as the viability of the material platform for exploring light-matter interaction with colloidal QDs.</description>

      <title>Induced Berry Connection and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Optical Dirac Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of optical Dirac theory, we present a field-theoretical model of spin-orbit interaction and photonic spin/orbit Hall effects. Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum (SAM) of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Division Phase Random Optimization for High-Speed Arbitrary Optical Intensity Waveform Monitoring Using Opto-Electronic Finite Impulse Response Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a high-bandwidth optical intensity waveform monitoring technique based on frequency-division phase random optimization (FD-PRO) using an opto-electronic finite impulse response (OE-FIR) filter. In this technology, phase random optimization (PRO) enable the estimation of the signal spectral phase. Frequency-division analysis (FDA) combined with PRO saves the iteration required for the optimization, accelerating the signal spectral phase estimation. FDA also facilitates the estimation of the signal spectral amplitude. Using FD-PRO, arbitrary optical intensity waveforms can be easily reconstructed without relying on high-speed digital signal processing. Experimental results reveal that the temporal waveforms are successfully reconstructed at 18-ps resolution.</description>

      <title>Nature Inspired Design Methodology for a Wide Field of View Achromatic Metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metalenses have become ubiquitous in academic research and have begun to make their transition to industry. However, chromatic aberration still greatly limits the applications of metalenses. Achieving a wide field-of-view (FOV) is another challenge that has been dealt with successfully by using a removed stop, but when combined with broadband spectrum, lateral chromatic aberration severely limits performance. In this paper we tackle this grand challenge and present a comprehensive design methodology for a simultaneously wide-FOV and achromatic metalens which is inspired by the human visual system. As a design example, we present a metalens operating in the near infrared (NIR), with 10% relative spectral bandwidth (807-893nm), focal length of 5mm, F/5, and FOV of +/-20 degrees. In particular, we show how to optimize the stop position, and correct the lateral chromatic aberration, both of which have not been reported in the past. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the metalens using accurate performance metrics, and demonstrate the improvement compared to a chromatic metalens. Our approach paves the way for the design of wide FOV metalenses that can operate over a relatively large bandwidth, effectively contributing to the widespread implementation of metalens science and technology.</description>

      <title>Generation of photon pairs through spontaneous four-wave mixing in thin nonlinear layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are a key resource for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests flat platforms, such as ultrathin layers and metasurfaces, as sources of photon pairs. Despite the success in the demonstration of spontaneous parametric-down-conversion (SPDC) from such flat sources, there are almost no works on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) - an alternative process to generate photon pairs. Meanwhile, SFWM can be implemented in any nanostructures, including isotropic and centrosymmetric ones, which are easier to fabricate than crystalline structures needed for SPDC. Here, we investigate photon pair generation through SFWM in subwavelength layers of amorphous silicon nitride (SiN) and study the effect of nitrogen content on the rate of pair emission. By observing two-photon interference between SFWM from the SiN layers and from the fused silica substrate, we find the third-order susceptibilities of layers with different nitrogen content. Finally, we demonstrate SFWM in lithium niobate, which is a second-order nonlinear material and where the direct SFWM can coexist with a cascaded process. Our results open a path for the implementation of SFWM in resonant flat structures, such as metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Tunable megawatt-scale sub-20 fs visible pulses from a fiber laser source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable ultrashort laser pulses across the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared with high peak power are crucial for wide-ranging applications in science and industry. Resonant dispersive-wave emission in gas-filled hollow-core fibers is a well-established technique for generating tunable ultrashort pulses from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near-infrared. However, previous demonstrations have relied on complex and expensive laser systems to provide the necessary energetic ultrashort pump pulses. Recent advances in fiber laser technology, particularly gain-managed nonlinear amplification, offer a promising alternative pump source. In this work, we combine gain-managed nonlinear amplification with resonant dispersive-wave emission to demonstrate a compact and tunable source of sub-20 fs pulses at 4.8 MHz. We achieve a tunable output spanning from 400 nm to beyond 700 nm, with energy up to 39 nJ, pulse duration down to 13 fs, and peak power exceeding 2 MW. This compact and efficient laser source opens new avenues for deploying resonant dispersive-wave-based technologies for broader scientific and industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution imaging is essential in microscopy, yet light scattering poses significant challenges in achieving it. Here, we present an approach to holographic imaging of spatially incoherent objects through scattering media, utilizing a virtual medium that replicates the scattering effects of the actual medium. This medium is constructed by retrieving mutually incoherent fields from the object, and exploiting the spatial correlations between them. By numerically propagating the incoherent fields through the virtual medium, we non-invasively compensate for scattering, achieving accurate 3D reconstructions of hidden objects. Experimental validation with fluorescent and synthetic incoherent objects confirms the effectiveness of this approach, opening new possibilities for advanced 3D high-resolution microscopy in scattering environments.</description>

      <title>Modeling of photonic integrated resonators using advanced scattering matrix methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a universal approach for modeling complex integrated photonic resonators based on the scattering matrix method. By dividing devices into basic elements including directional cou-plers and connecting waveguides, our approach can be used to model integrated photonic reso-nators with both unidirectional and bidirectional light propagation, with the simulated spectral response showing good agreement with experimental results. A simplified form of our ap-proach, which divides devices into several independent submodules such as microring resonators and Sagnac interferometers, is also introduced to streamline the calculation of spectral transfer functions. Finally, we discuss the deviations introduced by approximations in our modeling, along with strategies for improving modeling accuracy. Our approach is universal across dif-ferent integrated platforms, providing a useful tool for designing and optimizing integrated photonic devices with complex configurations.</description>

      <title>Photonic integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers</title>

Abstract: Photonic integrated single mode lasers that deliver ultra-low fundamental linewidth and high output power are critical for future precision atomic and quantum sciences, high-capacity coherent fiber communications, fiber sensing, and ultra-low-noise microwave and mmWave generation. Achieving both low frequency noise and high power simultaneously requires a laser that can provide strong nonlinear noise suppression with an ultra-high quality factor (Q) large mode volume lasing cavity to reach a large intra-cavity photon population. Photonic integrated Brillouin lasers are an important candidate for applications requiring high optical power and phase noise suppression. Here, we report a significant breakthrough in integrated laser design using Brillouin lasing in a large mode volume, ultra-high Q, coil resonator cavity. We demonstrate Brillouin lasing in a 4-meter-coil resonator achieving a 31 mHz fundamental linewidth, corresponding to a 10 mHz$^2$/Hz white frequency noise floor, 41 mW output power, and 73 dB sidemode suppression ratio. We further demonstrate that this laser can be Vernier tuned across a 22.5 nm range. The meter-scale cavity enables the photon population and output power to be greatly increased before the onset of second-order Brillouin lasing. The increased mode volume is realized in an ultra-low loss silicon nitride coil-based silicon nitride resonator and the underlying Brillouin physics supports lasing with almost arbitrary cavity geometries. Brillouin lasers with ultra-high-Q and large optical volume waveguide resonator can be adapted to a wide range of wavelengths from visible to infrared and scaled to larger cavities, further reducing the linewidth and increasing the output power, and setting a new domain for on-chip precision lasers.</description>

      <title>Open transmission channels in multimode fiber cavities with random mode mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of light in disordered media is governed by open transmission channels, which enable nearly complete transmission of the incident power, despite low average transmission. Extensively studied in diffusive media and chaotic cavities, open channels exhibit unique properties such as universal spatial structure and extended dwell times. However, their experimental study is challenging due to the large number of modes required for control and measurement. We propose a multimode fiber cavity (MMFC) as a platform to explore open channels. Leveraging mode confinement and finite angular spread, MMFCs enable a full control over all channels. This allowed us to achieve an 18-fold power enhancement by selectively exciting an open channel with a transmission rate of $0.90 \pm 0.04$. By analyzing 100 transmission matrices of MMFC realizations, we observed a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution, indicating high channel control and low losses. The scalability of MMFCs, combined with long dwell times and potential for nonlinear phenomena, offers new opportunities for studying complex wave transport.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Excitation and Spin Pumping of Chirally Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</description>

      <title>An Inorganic Liquid Crystalline Dispersion with 2D Ferroelectric Moieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optical effect based liquid crystal devices have been extensively used in optical modulation techniques, in which the Kerr coefficient reflects the sensitivity of the liquid crystals and determines the strength of the device operational electric field. The Peterlin-Stuart theory and the O'Konski model jointly indicate that a giant Kerr coefficient could be obtained in a material with both a large geometrical anisotropy and an intrinsic polarization, but such a material is not yet reported. Here we reveal a ferroelectric effect in a monolayer two-dimensional mineral vermiculite. A large geometrical anisotropy factor and a large inherent electric dipole together raise the record value of Kerr coefficient by an order of magnitude, till $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ m V$^{-2}$. This finding enables an ultra-low operational electric field of $10^2$-$10^4$ V m$^{-1}$ and the fabrication of electro-optical devices with an inch-level electrode separation, which is not practical previously. Because of its high ultraviolet stability (decay &lt;1% under ultraviolet exposure of 1000 hours), large-scale, and energy-efficiency, prototypical displayable billboards have been fabricated for outdoor interactive scenes. The work provides new insights for both liquid crystal optics and two-dimensional ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Magneto-plasmonic pesponse of nickel nano-rings prepared by electroless method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-plasmonic nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for advanced sensing applications. However, conventional fabrication methods, such as lithography and sputtering, often involve high costs and complex processes. This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating nickel nano-rings (200-600 nm in diameter) utilizing nanosphere lithography and selective electroless deposition on ITO substrates. The resulting nickel-silver-boron (Ni-Ag-B) nanoarrays exhibit uniform, durable coatings with robust covalent bonds, providing a simpler, more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The unique ring-shaped geometry of the nano-rings enhances plasmonic effects by concentrating the electromagnetic field, thus outperforming other nanostructures. Unlike thin films, these nano-rings demonstrate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) within the 470-614 nm range when illuminated at a 45$^{\deg}$ incident angle. Moreover, ellipsometry parameter calculations and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements revealed narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) peaks at 512 nm and 560 nm, indicating superior sensitivity for detection compared to conventional SPR and ellipsometry-SPR techniques. Finite element simulations using COMSOL provided valuable insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the electromagnetic response of the nano-rings, confirming their potential for optical communication and highly sensitive sensing technologies. This study addresses limitations in existing magneto-plasmonic systems, offering a scalable and innovative solution for the development of next-generation sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising of a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimoni-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, conforming with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Self Seed in 391-nm N$_2^{+}$ Air Lasing by Vectorially Structured Light Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single intense near-infrared femtosecond laser beam can generate ultraviolet N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm in the air, offering a promising tool for remote sensing. One of the key debates regarding its mechanism is whether it is seeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic, which is inevitably produced by the charge gradient in the laser plasma filament. In this study, we generated both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm, in contrast to that the second harmonic in argon is found near zero at the azimuthal polarization case. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution of the radially polarized 391-nm lasing, we concluded that the phase of the 391-nm lasing aligns with the driving field, thereby ruling out the hypothesis of self-seeding by the second harmonic. Our work also provides a promising method to remotely generate vectorially structured ultraviolet light fields.</description>

      <title>Hybrid sub- and superradiant states in emitter arrays with quantized motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of dipolar emitters which couple collectively to the radiation field display sub- and superradiance. These terms refer to a reduction or an enhancement of photon emission rates due to the interference of emission channels. Arrays of trapped neutral atoms constitute a promising platform for harnessing this phenomenon in technological applications, e.g. for excitation storage, single-photon switches and mirrors. However, vibrational motion of the atoms within their traps leads to position fluctuations that entangle the motion and the internal atomic degrees of freedom, which is expected to affect the collective photon emission. We develop here a theory for collective atom-light coupling in the presence of this quantized motion within the Lamb-Dicke limit. We show the existence of sub- and superradiant states, which are hybrids of electronic and vibrational excitations and explore their properties for analytically and numerically efficiently solvable cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.</description>

Abstract: In Floquet engineering, we apply a time-periodic modulation to change the effective behavior of a wave system. In this work, we generalize Floquet engineering to exploit spatial degrees of freedom, expanding the scope of effective behaviors we can access. We develop a perturbative procedure to engineer space-time dependent driving forces that effectively transform broad classes of tight-binding systems into one another. We demonstrate several applications, including removing disorder, undoing Anderson localization, and enhancing localization to an extreme in spatially modulated waveguides. This procedure straightforwardly extends to other types of physical systems and different Floquet driving field implementations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide</title>

Abstract: Silicon photonics arises as a viable solution to address the stringent resource demands of emergent technologies, such as neural networks. Within this framework, photonic memories are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits that have not yet found a standardized solution due to several trade-off among different metrics such as energy consumption, speed, footprint, or fabrication complexity, to name a few. In particular, a photonic memory exhibiting ultra-high endurance performance (&gt; 10^6 cycles) has been elusive to date. Here, we report an ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide (VO_2) exhibiting a record cyclability of up to 10^7 cycles without degradation. Moreover, our memory features an ultra-compact footprint below 5 {\mu}m with potential for nanosecond and picojoule programming performance. Our silicon photonic memory could find application in emerging photonic applications demanding high number of memory updates such as photonic neural networks with in-situ training.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vector Network Analysis With a Photonic Frequency Extender Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a photonic ultra-wideband frequency extension for a commercial Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to perform free-space measurements in a frequency range from 70 GHz up to 520 GHz with a Hz level resolution. The concept is based on the synchronization of continuous-wave (CW) lasers with highly frequency-stable electronic emitter sources as a reference. The use of CW photomixers with bandwidths up to several terahertz allows for the straightforward expansion of the covered frequency range to 1 THz or even beyond. This can be achieved, for instance, by cascading additional lasers within the synchronization scheme. Consequently, the necessity for additional frequency extender modules, as seen in current state-of-the-art VNAs, is eliminated, thereby reducing the complexity and cost of the system significantly. To showcase the capabilities of the Photonic Vector Network Analyzer (PVNA) extender concept, we conducted S21 transmission measurements of various cross-shaped bandpass filters and waveguide-coupled high-frequency (HF) components. Additionally, the analyzed magnitude and phase data were either compared to electro-magnetic (EM) simulations or referenced against data obtained from commercial electronic frequency extender modules.</description>

      <title>Photo-Heating of Optically Transparent Solids Driven by Electronic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light absorption in opaque solids is directly governed by optical transitions between the electronic states near the bandgap. This physical mechanism underlies the optical heating of a medium that efficiently absorbs light at resonance. However, such a strategy is true for a homogeneous bulk medium that is temporally dispersive. This work focuses on the photo-heating of optically transparent solids owing to light scattering rather than absorption. A light-induced optical inhomogeneity (vacancy, ad-atom, etc.) produces an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum that enhances light-matter interaction. As a result, indirect optical transitions become accessible throughout the entire Brillouin zone due to electron-photon momentum matching. According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, nonlocal media can capture light solely through electronic light scattering. Herein, we demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductors (silicon atomic-force-microscopy cantilever) and metals (gold shear-force-microscopy tip) under continuous-wave sub-band pumping. Light scattering based on electron-photon interaction becomes the dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion. These findings are critical for cutting-edge technologies in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Microchip semiconductor membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first microchip semiconductor membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser. This compact type of laser consists solely of a semiconductor gain region present as a micron-thin membrane, sandwiched between two transparent heat spreaders. The heat spreaders have a highly reflective coating on their outer facets, which assembles the laser's plane-parallel solid-state cavity with a total length of just ~1 mm. One of the coatings with slightly reduced reflectivity acts as outcoupling mirror. The microchip membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser (microchip MECSEL) is optically pumped with a standard fiber-coupled diode laser module emitting at 808 nm and stabilizes itself due to an occurring thermal lens. More than one watt of continuous wave output power around 1123 nm and a record value in fitted slope efficiency of ~51.4 % with MECSELs, while maintaining excellent beam quality (TEM_00, M^2 &lt; 1.05), is demonstrated. Important properties of semiconductor lasers such as the efficiency, beam quality, and polarization were investigated. Further, this setup was used to characterize the thermal lens and it's dependence on the absorbed pump power in the microchip MECSEL. Such systems represent an attractive solution, when high-power output at customizable emission wavelength with excellent beam quality is needed in combination with very compact built size.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Zero-Threshold PT-Symmetric Polariton-Raman Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</description>

Abstract: Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum networks. Because of the fragility and low generation rate of genuine multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, which removes all detector side channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDIQCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.</description>
