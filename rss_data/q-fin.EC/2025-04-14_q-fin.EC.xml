      <title>The Influence of Culture on Migration Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UN migration data and Hofstede's six cultural dimensions make it possible to find a connection between migration patterns and culture from a longterm perspective. Migrant patterns have been studied from the perspective of both immigrants and OECD host countries. This study tests two hypotheses: first, that the number of migrants leaving for OECD countries is influenced by cultural similarities to the host country; and second, that OECD host countries are more likely to accept culturally close migrants. Both hypotheses were tested using the Mann/Whitney U test for 93 countries between 1995 and 2015. The relationship between cultural and geodesic distance also analysed. The results indicate that cultural proximity significantly influences migration patterns, although the impact varies across countries. About two/thirds of OECD countries show a positive correlation between cultural similarity and geographic proximity, with notable exceptions, such as New Zealand and Australia, which exhibit a negative correlation. Countries such as Colombia, Denmark, and Japan maintain cultural distance, even from their neighbouring countries. Migrants from wealthier countries tend to select culturally similar destinations, whereas those from poorer countries often migrate to culturally distant destinations. Approximately half of OECD countries demonstrate a statistically significant bias towards accepting culturally close migrants. The results of this study highlight the importance of a critical debate that recognises and accepts the influence of culture on migration patterns.</description>

      <title>SME Gender-Related Innovation: A Non-Numerical Trend Analysis Using Positive, Zero, and Negative Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses gender-related aspects of innovation processes in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Classical analytical and statistical approaches often struggle with the high complexity and insufficient data typical of gender-related innovation studies. We propose a trend-based modelling framework that requires minimal information and uses non-numerical quantifiers: increasing, constant, and decreasing. This approach enables the analysis of ten-dimensional models including variables such as Gender, Product Innovation, Process Innovation, and High-Risk Tolerance. Using trend-based artificial intelligence methods, we identify 13 distinct scenarios and all possible transitions between them. This allows for the evaluation of queries like: Can exports increase while gender parameters remain constant? Two versions of the GASI trend model are presented: the original and an expert-modified version addressing critiques related to scenario transitions. The final model confirms stability and supports the assumption that "no tree grows to heaven." Trend-based modelling offers a practical, interpretable alternative for complex, data-scarce systems.</description>

      <title>Bunching and Taxing Multidimensional Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize optimal policy in a multidimensional nonlinear taxation model with bunching. We develop an empirically relevant model with cognitive and manual skills, firm heterogeneity, and labor market sorting. We first derive two conditions for the optimality of taxes that take into account bunching. The first condition $-$ a stochastic dominance optimal tax condition $-$ shows that at the optimum the schedule of benefits dominates the schedule of distortions in terms of second-order stochastic dominance. The second condition $-$ a global optimal tax formula $-$ provides a representation that balances the local costs and benefits of optimal taxation while explicitly accounting for global incentive constraints. Second, we use Legendre transformations to represent our problem as a linear program. This linearization allows us to solve the model quantitatively and to precisely characterize bunching. At an optimum, 10 percent of workers is bunched. We introduce two notions of bunching $-$ blunt bunching and targeted bunching. Blunt bunching constitutes 30 percent of all bunching, occurs at the lowest regions of cognitive and manual skills, and lumps the allocations of these workers resulting in a significant distortion. Targeted bunching constitutes 70 percent of all bunching and recognizes the workers' comparative advantage. The planner separates workers on their dominant skill and bunches them on their weaker skill, thus mitigating distortions along the dominant skill dimension.</description>
