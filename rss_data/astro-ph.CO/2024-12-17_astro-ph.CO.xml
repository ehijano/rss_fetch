      <title>Observational constraints on freezing quintessence in a non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the freezing quintessence scenario in late-time cosmic expansion using a non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity model, $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We consider a solution for this model using an appropriate parametrization of the scale factor, and then the model is constrained by observational datasets, including CC, Pantheon+ (SN), and CC+SN+BAO. Our analysis yields results aligning closely with observational data. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, matter-energy density, and EoS parameter of our model exhibit expected trends over cosmic time, supporting its physical validity. Furthermore, the model demonstrates consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM model in late times, displaying freezing behavior in the $\omega - \omega'$ plane and stability against density perturbations. Our findings suggest that the modified $f(R, L_m)$ gravity model is a credible approach to describing the universe's accelerating phase.</description>

      <title>DeepWiener: Neural Networks for CMB polarization maps and power spectrum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the early Universe, it is essential to estimate cosmological parameters with high accuracy, which depends on the optimal reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of their power spectrum. In this paper, we generalize the neural network developed for applying the Wiener Filter, initially presented for temperature maps in previous work, to polarization maps. Our neural network has a UNet architecture, including an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. In addition, we propose an iterative approach for reconstructing the E and B-mode fields, while addressing the E-to-B leakage present in the maps due to incomplete sky coverage. The accuracy achieved is satisfactory compared to the Wiener Filter solution computed with the standard Conjugate Gradient method, and it is highly efficient, enabling the computation of the power spectrum of an unknown signal using the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps at the power spectrum level along with their corresponding errors, finding that these errors are smaller than those obtained using the well-known pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach. Our results show that increasing complexity in the applied mask presents a more significant challenge for B-mode reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume, that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be, unstable and quantify the decay using the life-time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales.We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA-I Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.1\%$ and $4.64\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.01 $ and $\Gamma = 0.074 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <title>A New Census of the Universe's Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Playground of Lognormal Seminumerical Simulations of the Lyman $\alpha$ Forest: Thermal History of the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to test a potential application of lognormal seminumerical simulations to recover the thermal parameters and Jeans length. This could be suitable for generating large number of synthetic spectra with various input data and parameters, and thus ideal for interpreting the high-quality data obtained from QSO absorption spectra surveys.
  We use a seminumerical approach to simulate absorption spectra of quasars at redshifts $ 3 \leq z \leq 5$. These synthetic spectra are compared with the 1D flux power spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis method we determine the temperature at mean density, slope of the temperature-density relation and Jeans length. Our best-fit model is also compared with the evolution of the temperature of the intergalactic medium from various UVB models.
  We show that the lognormal simulations can effectively recover thermal parameters and Jeans length. Besides, by comparing the synthetic flux power spectra with observations from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey we found, that such an approach can be also used for the cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>The cosmic history of Primordial Black Hole accretion and its uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) have not been experimentally detected so far, but their existence would provide important insights about the early Universe and serve as one of the possible candidates of dark matter (DM). In this work, we explore the accretion of radiation and matter by PBHs, with relevance for the growth of PBH seeds to form early Supermassive Black Holes; the emission from accreting PBHs; and constraints from gravitational wave observations, among others. We study the growth of PBH masses in the early Universe due to the accretion of radiation, highlighting uncertainties which arise from estimates of the PBH formation time. For baryonic accretion, we review the traditional Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) and its refined version known as the Park-Ricotti (PR) model, which also includes radiative feedback. We find that in the BHL model, PBHs heavier than $\sim 100 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can grow in mass by several orders of magnitude by $z \lesssim 10$, though only when surrounded by DM halos and only when the accretion efficiency is large. By contrast, the inclusion of radiation feedback in the PR model can drastically suppress the baryonic accretion rate of PBHs, leading to a negligible change in PBH mass over cosmic time. Furthermore our calculations show that the accretion rate depends sensitively on the modelling of various parameters such as the speed of sound in the baryonic gas and the velocity of PBHs. These findings highlight the uncertainties associated with accretion onto PBHs, and we find that a large increase in the PBH mass due to accretion is by no means guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity and cosmic initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary target of the \Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe physics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A significant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the Universe. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the upcoming \Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By including the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the method takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity, and goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for example, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and scale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles systematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and galaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of up to $\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\Delta L = 62.5\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \Euclid data. We also provide data products, including realistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of adiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and advantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in the large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy between early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while mitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.</description>

      <title>Horndeski in motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies within the family of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, where the scalar field features an inhomogeneous profile but it preserves a translational symmetry that is realised as a combination of spatial translations and internal shifts. The spatial gradient of the scalar field introduces a preferred direction, so the resulting cosmologies are of the axisymmetric Bianchi I type. The momentum density of these configurations exhibits a universal evolution and an additional component with non-vanishing momentum density is required to have non-trivial effects. We show the relation of these scenarios with cosmologies of non-comoving components and, in particular, we explain how they provide a specific realisation of moving dark energy models. Among the class of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, we analyse in more detail the case of Kinetic Gravity Braiding with emphasis on its application to moving dark energy models and its effects on large scale dark flows as well as the CMB dipole and quadrupole.</description>

      <title>$X+y$: insights on gas thermodynamics from the combination of X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data cross-correlated with cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the third-year release of the Dark Energy Survey, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps from Planck, and X-ray maps from ROSAT. We investigate the possibility of developing a physical model able to jointly describe both measurements, simultaneously constraining the spatial distribution and thermodynamic properties of hot gas. We find that a relatively simple model is able to describe both sets of measurements and to make reasonably accurate predictions for other observables (the tSZ auto-correlation, its cross-correlation with X-rays, and tomographic measurements of the bias-weighted mean gas pressure). We show, however, that contamination from X-ray AGN, as well as the impact of non-thermal pressure support, must be incorporated in order to fully resolve tensions in parameter space between different data combinations. We obtain simultaneous constraints on the mass scale at which half of the gas content has been expelled from the halo, $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_c)=14.83^{+0.16}_{-0.23}$, on the polytropic index of the gas, $\Gamma=1.144^{+0.016}_{-0.013}$, and on the ratio of the central gas temperature to the virial temperature $\alpha_T=1.30^{+0.15}_{-0.28}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Electroweak Baryogenesis via Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet $S$ with an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry offers a minimal framework for realizing electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) during a first-order electroweak phase transition. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism where spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking enables EWBG via domain walls separating two distinct phases of the $S$ field. These domain walls feature restored (or weakly broken) EW symmetry in their cores and sweep through space, generating the baryon asymmetry below the temperature of EW symmetry breaking. We identify the key conditions for the existence of EW-symmetric domain wall cores and analyze the dynamics required for wall propagation over sufficient spatial volumes. Additionally, we outline the CP-violating sources necessary for baryogenesis under different regimes of domain wall evolution. The parameter space accommodating this mechanism spans singlet masses from sub-eV to 15 GeV, accompanied by a non-vanishing mixing with the Higgs boson. Unlike the standard realization of EWBG in the minimal singlet-extended SM, which is notoriously difficult to test, our scenario can be probed by a wide range of existing and upcoming experiments, including fifth force searches, rare meson decays, and EDM measurements.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a generalized modified Friedmann equation based on an entropy-area relation that incorporates established modifications, such as volumetric, linear, and logarithmic terms, in addition to novel entropic modifications that might yield to relevant cosmological implications at different stages of the evolution of the Universe. Some of these modifications are capable of mimicking the effects of dark energy and describing the current state of accelerated expansion of the Universe. We study particular cases of the generalized Friedmann equation and constrain the free parameters using observational datasets, including Hubble parameter measurements, baryon acoustic oscillations, and strong lensing systems. Our findings indicate that the proposed models align well with current observational data, particularly in low-redshift regimes; furthermore, these models are compatible with the value of $H_0$ obtained by the SH0ES program.</description>

Abstract: We present measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) and cosmic HI density ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$) at $0 \leq z \leq 0.088$ from the Looking at the Distant Universe with MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey. Using LADUMA Data Release 1 (DR1), we analyze the HIMF via a new "recovery matrix" (RM) method that we benchmark against a more traditional Modified Maximum Likelihood (MML) method. Our analysis, which implements a forward modeling approach, corrects for survey incompleteness and uses extensive synthetic source injections to ensure robust estimates of the HIMF parameters and their associated uncertainties. This new method tracks the recovery of sources in mass bins different from those in which they were injected and incorporates a Poisson likelihood in the forward modeling process, allowing it to correctly handle uncertainties in bins with few or no detections. The application of our analysis to a high-purity subsample of the LADUMA DR1 spectral line catalog in turn mitigates any possible biases that could result from the inconsistent treatment of synthetic and real sources. For the surveyed redshift range, the recovered Schechter function normalization, low-mass slope, and "knee" mass are $\phi_\ast = 3.56_{-1.92}^{+0.97} \times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ dex$^{-1}$, $\alpha = -1.18_{-0.19}^{+0.08}$, and $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) = 10.01_{-0.12}^{+0.31}$, respectively, which together imply a comoving cosmic HI density of $\Omega_{\rm HI}=3.09_{-0.47}^{+0.65}\times 10^{-4}$. Our results show consistency between RM and MML methods and with previous low-redshift studies, giving confidence that the cosmic volume probed by LADUMA, even at low redshifts, is not an outlier in terms of its HI content.</description>

Abstract: We review the main topics in the field of blazar multiwavelength variability as a tool to understand the physics and structure of extragalactic jets and their central engine. We address issues such as the cross-correlation between flux variations at different frequencies, the mechanisms to explain the long-term and short-term variability, the size of the jet emitting regions, the polarization behaviour, and the periodicities detected in the multiwavelength light curves.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Axions and Associated Relics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fuzzy axion dark matter in type IIB string theory, for axions descending from the Ramond-Ramond four-form in compactifications on orientifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Such models can be tested by cosmological measurements if a significant relic abundance of fuzzy dark matter arises, which we argue is most common in models with small numbers of axions. We construct a topologically exhaustive ensemble of more than 350,000 Calabi-Yau compactifications yielding up to seven axions, and in this setting we perform a systematic analysis of misalignment production of fuzzy dark matter. In typical regions of moduli space, the fuzzy axion, the QCD axion, and other axions have comparable decay constants of $f_a \approx 10^{16}$ GeV. We find that overproduction of heavier axions is problematic, except at special loci in moduli space where decay constant hierarchies can occur: without a contrived reheating epoch, it is necessary to fine-tune initial displacements. The resulting dark matter is typically a mix of fuzzy axions and heavier axions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons are typically present as a consequence of the orientifold projection. We examine the signatures of these models by simulating halos with multiple fuzzy axions, and by computing new cosmological constraints on ultralight axions and dark radiation. We also give evidence that cosmic birefringence is possible in this setting. Our findings determine the phenomenological correlates of fuzzy axion dark matter in a corner of the landscape.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the theoretical framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB experiments. In particular, we clarify that what has been referred to as cosmic variance in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, when an optimal estimator is used, this variance can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements and will continue to diminish in future experiments. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Primordial B-mode Detection: Comprehensive Delensing Pipelines for Improved Sensitivity to $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing the impact of contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by Large Scale Structure, we examine delensing methods to enhance sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in primordial B-mode detection experiments. This study presents a realistic pipeline to improve $r$ constraints using foreground-cleaned maps with negligible residuals. The pipeline, based on simulations, is adaptable for future experiments. We focus on two delensing approaches: (1) subtracting the gradient-order lensing B-mode template, computed by convolving the E-mode with the lensing potential, from the observed B-mode signal; and (2) remapping observations using the estimated inverse deflection angle. For parameter constraints, we employ three models to reduce $r$ uncertainty and bias, finding consistent uncertainties across models, though biases vary due to the multipole-dependence of the delensing fraction. %We demonstrate the pipeline using simulated maps from future CMB polarization experiments, including a small-aperture (sub-1m) telescope, a large-aperture (6m) telescope, and a future space mission (3m). We demonstrated this pipeline using simulated observation maps from future CMB polarization experiments, which included current representative ground-based small aperture telescopes (sub-1m), next-generation ground-based large aperture telescopes (6m), and highly competitive future space-based medium aperture missions (3m). Results show a delensing efficiency of 40\% with the small-aperture telescope alone, increasing to 65\% when combined with the large-aperture telescope, and 80\% with the satellite mission. These lead to reductions in $r$ uncertainty by 46\% for ground-based and 63\% for space missions. The most promising method adds the lensing template B-mode as an additional frequency channel, minimizing bias on $r$.</description>

      <title>A Semiblind Reconstruction of the History of Effective Number of Neutrinos Using CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of redshift-dependent deviations in the contribution of relativistic degrees of freedom to the radiation budget of the cosmos, conventionally parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$, from the predictions of the standard model. We expand the deviations $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ in terms of top-hat functions and treat their amplitudes as the free parameters of the theory to be measured alongside the standard cosmological parameters by the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, as well as performing forecasts for futuristic CMB surveys such as PICO and CMB-S4. We reconstruct the history of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and find that with the current data the history is consistent with the standard scenario. Inclusion of the new degrees of freedom in the analysis increases $H_0$ to $68.71\pm 0.44$, slightly reducing the Hubble tension. With the smaller forecasted errors on the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ parametrization modes from future CMB surveys, very accurate bounds are expected within the possible range of dark radiation models.</description>

      <title>Hubble Expansion Signature on Simulated Halo Density Profiles: A Path to Observing the Turnaround Radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density profiles are important tools in galaxy cluster research, offering insights into clusters dynamical states and their relationship with the broader Universe. While these profiles provide valuable information about the matter content of the Universe, their utility in understanding its dark energy component has remained limited due a lack of tools allowing us to study the transition from cluster portions that are relaxed and infalling, to those that are merging with the Hubble flow. In this work we investigate signatures of this transition in stacked density profiles of simulated cluster-sized halos at different redshifts. To highlight the Hubble flow around clusters we use their turnaround radius to normalize stacked simulated density profiles and calculate their logarithmic slope. Then, we complement our analysis by modeling the outer portions of these profiles assuming Gaussian early Universe statistics and spherical collapse without shell-crossing. We find the logarithmic slope of median cluster density profiles beyond the turnaround radius - where the Hubble flow dominates - to be Universal and well described by our model. Importantly, we find the slope of the profiles to diverge from the SCM prediction from within the turnaround radius where the actual profiles exhibit caustics which give rise to the splashback feature. We suggest utilizing this divergence from the spherical collapse model as a method to identify the turnaround radius in stacked cluster density profiles, offering a new perspective on understanding cluster dynamics and their cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Dynamical Scalars: Tracking Solutions and the Possibility of a Stasis-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model give rise to cosmological histories exhibiting extended epochs of cosmological stasis. During such epochs, the abundances of different energy components such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy each remain fixed despite cosmological expansion. In previous analyses of the stasis phenomenon, these different energy components were modeled as fluids with fixed, unchanging equations of state. In this paper, by contrast, we consider more realistic systems involving dynamical scalars which pass through underdamping transitions as the universe expands. Indeed, such systems might be highly relevant for BSM scenarios involving higher-dimensional bulk moduli and inflatons. Remarkably, we find that stasis emerges even in such situations, despite the appearance of time-varying equations of state. Moreover, this stasis includes several new features which might have important phenomenological implications and applications. For example, in the presence of an additional "background" energy component, we find that the scalars evolve into a "tracking" stasis in which the stasis equation of state automatically tracks that of the background. This phenomenon exists even if the background has only a small initial abundance. We also discuss the intriguing possibility that our results might form the basis of a new "Stasis Inflation" scenario in which no ad-hoc inflaton potential is needed and in which there is no graceful-exit problem. Within such a scenario, the number of e-folds of cosmological expansion produced is directly related to the hierarchies between physical BSM mass scales. Moreover, non-zero matter and radiation abundances can be sustained throughout the inflationary epoch.</description>

Abstract: The full sky measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies by $\textit{WMAP}$ and $\textit{Planck}$ have highlighted the presence of several unexpected isotropy-breaking features on the largest angular scales.
  In this work, we investigate the impact of the local large-scale structure on these anomalies through the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. We use a constrained hydrodynamical simulation that reproduces the local Universe in a box of $500\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc to construct full sky maps of the temperature anisotropies produced by these two CMB secondary effects and discuss their statistical properties on large angular scales. We show the significant role played by the Virgo cluster on these scales, and compare it to theoretical predictions and random patches of the universe obtained from the hydrodynamical simulation $\textit{Magneticum}$.
  We explore three of the main CMB large-scale anomalies -- i.e., lack of correlation, quadrupole-octopole alignment and hemispherical asymmetry -- , both in the latest $\textit{Planck}$ data (PR4), where they are detected at a similar level to the previous releases, and using the simulated secondaries from the local Universe, verifying their negligible impact.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from a Single Annihilating Particle Species: Extending Stasis Into the Thermal Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extended cosmological epochs can exist during which the abundances associated with different energy components remain constant despite cosmological expansion. Indeed, this "stasis" behavior has been found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of states, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous studies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more specifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential role in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that stasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments, with thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover, within such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a single state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus extends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that thermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even when only a single matter species is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of $z \sim 9-16$ from the ${James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope}$ (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by the scattering of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium expanding with the Hubble flow, until they Doppler shift out of resonance and escape towards the observer. This leads to the formation of the so-called Loeb-Rybicki intergalactic haloes, which are expected to be prominent even before the epoch of reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal from the clustering of these haloes, with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few to a few tens of standard deviations out to $z \sim 13$ and marginally out to $z \sim 16$, using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole isocurvature: the effect of non-Gaussianities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_{\rm PBH}&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ can dominate transiently the energy budget of the Universe and reheat the Universe through their evaporation taking place before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The isocurvature energy density fluctuations associated to the inhomogeneous distribution of a population of such PBHs can induce an abundant production of GWs due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we discuss the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering properties of PBHs and study the effect of a clustered PBH population on the spectral shape of the aforementioned induced GW signal. In particular, focusing on local-type non-Gaussianity we find a double-peaked GW signal with the amplitude of the low-frequency peak being proportional to the square of the non-Gaussian parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NL}$. Remarkably, depending on the PBH mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ and the initial abundance of PBHs at formation time, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, this double-peaked GW signal can lie well within the frequency bands of forthcoming GW detectors, namely LISA, ET, SKA and BBO, hence rendering this signal falsifiable by GW experiments and promoting it as a novel portal probing the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Narrowing down the Hubble tension to the first two rungs of distance ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decade-persistent Hubble tension has become a $5\sigma$ crisis of modern cosmology between the early-Universe extrapolation from globally fitting the standard $\Lambda$CDM to Planck-CMB measurements and the late-Universe measurement from the three-rung distance ladder with SH0ES calibration. Regarding the current dilemma of theoretical resolutions, recent focus has shifted to systematics inspection. Here we find an associated $5\sigma$ tension in the intercept of the supernova magnitude-redshift relation between the second-rung and third-rung supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation independent of calibrations in use. As required by the consistency of the distance-ladder method, we propose a method to eliminate the intercept tension, directly constraining $H_0=73.4\pm1.0\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the first two-rung distance ladder alone without referring to the third-rung supernovae but still consistent with both SH0ES typical three-rung and first two-rung constraints, which not only supports our method to rebuild the intercept consistency but also rules out third-rung supernova systematics including the late-time transition in supernova absolute magnitude. Further crosschecking with the Carnegie Supernova Project revealed that different calibrators alone still consistently prefer our results. Therefore, the original Hubble tension between the Planck-CMB measurements and SH0ES three-rung distance ladder can be narrowed down to a tension between the Planck-CMB and the first two-rung measurements.</description>

Abstract: The Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method is a non-parametric component separation algorithm to remove the foreground contamination of the 21-cm intensity mapping data. In this work, we perform the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along the frequency axis in the expanded GNILC framework (denoted eGNILC) which helps reduce the power loss in low multipoles, and further demonstrate its performance. We also calculate the eGNILC bias to modify the criterion for determining the degrees of freedom of the foreground (dof), and embed the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in mixing matrix computation to obtain a blind component separation method. We find that the eGNILC bias is related to the averaged domain size and the dof of the foreground but not the underlying 21-cm signal. In case of no beam effect, the eGNILC bias is negligible for simple power law foregrounds outside the Galactic plane. We also examine the eGNILC performance in the SKA-MID (SKA Phase-I in mid-frequency) and BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) simulations. We show that if the adjacent frequency channels are not highly correlated, eGNILC can recover the underlying 21-cm signal with good accuracy. With the varying Airy-disk beam applied to both SKA-MID and BINGO, the power spectra of 21-cm can be effectively recovered at the multipoles $\ell \in [20, 250]$ and $[20, 300]$ respectively. With no instrumental noise, the SKA-MID exhibits $\lesssim 20\%$ power loss and BINGO exhibits $\sim 10\%$ power loss. The varying Airy-disk beam only causes significant errors at large multipoles.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>

Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Hubble Expansion and Entropy Rates in a Cosmological Model with Merging Clusters and Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cosmological model that incorporates the simultaneous merger process for evolving dark energy and evolving dark matter and analyzes its Hubble parameter behavior. To validate this model, we assess the applicability of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and the maximum entropy condition within this framework. We derive a generalized form of the Hubble parameter for this model, demonstrating that it converges to the standard Hubble parameter in the non-merger case (\(\xi = 0\)). The merging model's equation of state parameters resembles those of evolving dark matter and dark energy, with \(w_c(z) \simeq w_{\rm dm} \simeq 0\) and \(w_v(z) \simeq w_{\rm de} \simeq -1\) at $z\rightarrow 0$, aligning with recent observations. We attribute the roles of dynamical dark matter and dark energy to super-voids and super-clusters, the largest merging objects in the web-like universe. We compare our model by analyzing the Hubble parameter and the entropy along with its first and second derivatives for the $w$CDM and standard $\Lambda$CDM models. Our plots indicate that the models incorporating only cluster mergers exhibit greater discrepancies with both observational Hubble parameters and the standard model at $z &gt; 1$. A key finding is that in models featuring only cluster mergers, Hubble and entropy rates consistently decrease. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM model with both additive and non-additive entropy violates the convexity condition, whereas the merger voids model aligns with maximizing entropy and at the same time may help avert a \textit{Big Rip} scenario for our universe.</description>

Abstract: We study the reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis in the case of a vector inflaton. We concentrate on particle production during the phase of oscillating background, especially gravitational production induced by the presence of non-minimal coupling imposed by an isotropic and homogeneous Universe. Including processes involving the exchange of graviton, we then extend our study to decay into fermions via direct or anomalous couplings. The necessity of non-minimal gravitational coupling and the gauge nature of couplings to fermions implies a much richer phenomenology than for a scalar inflaton.</description>

Abstract: We compare the QCD axion phase-space distribution from unitarized next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory with the one extracted from pion-scattering data. We derive a robust bound by confronting momentum-dependent Boltzmann equations against up-to-date observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and of primordial abundances. These datasets imply $m_{a} \leq \, 0.16 $ eV for the 95% credible interval, i.e. $\sim$30% stronger bound than what previously found. We present forecasts using dedicated likelihoods for future cosmological surveys and the sphaleron rate from unquenched lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Final States in Quantum Cosmology: Cosmic Acceleration as a Quantum Post-Selection Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability assignment for quantum cosmology. To this end, we derive effective classical equations of motion for systems subject to both initial and final conditions. Remarkably, these effective equations do not depend on the details of the quantum theory, but only on the geometric features of the classical state space. When applied to Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, these effective equations generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics. Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect, that is, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black hole formation has been discussed widely, when density perturbations in the early universe cause matter to collapse gravitationally, giving rise to these ultra-compact objects. We propose and point out that such a gravitational collapse would also give rise to primordial naked singularities, that would play an important role in the observable features of present universe. We consider two types of collapse scenarios that give rise to event-like and object-like visible singularities within a cosmological background. We briefly discuss implications of primordial naked singularities, including those for dark matter, vis-a-vis primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Convergence Tests of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theory predicts that dark matter halos experience core-collapse, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. The N-body simulations used to study this process can suffer from numerical errors when simulation parameters are selected incorrectly. Optimal choices for simulation parameters are well studied for cold dark matter (CDM), but are not deeply understood when self-interactions are included. In order to perform reliable N-body simulations and model core-collapse accurately we must understand the potential numerical errors, how to diagnose them, and what parameter selections must be made to reduce them. We use the \texttt{Arepo} N-body code to perform convergence tests of core-collapsing SIDM halos across a range of halo concentrations and SIDM cross-sections, and quantify potential numerical issues related to mass resolution, timestep size, and gravitational softening length. Our tests discover that halos with fewer than $10^5$ simulation particles, a resolution typically not met by subhalos in N-body simulations, suffer from significant discreteness noise that leads to variation and extreme outliers in the collapse rate. At our lowest resolution of $N=10^4$ particles, this collapse time variation can reach as high as 20\%. At this low resolution we also find a bias in collapse times and a small number of extreme outliers. Additionally, we find that simulations which run far beyond the age of the Universe, which have been used to calibrate SIDM gravothermal fluid models in previous work, have a sensitivity to the timestep size that is not present in shorter simulations or simulations using only CDM. Our work shows that choices of simulation parameters that yield converged results for some halo masses and SIDM models do not necessarily yield convergence for others.</description>

      <title>Physical Pathways for JWST-Observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim7-9$. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds ($\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_\odot$), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation Power Spectrum of Garfinkle-Vachaspati Cosmic String Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the power spectrum $P_n$ of the $n$th harmonic for Garfinkle-Vachaspati cosmic strings, which correspond to planar rectangular loops. While these loop tractories are self-intersecting, a slightly perturbed non-self-intersecting form of these trajectories has been suggested as a generic end state of cosmic string loop fragmentation. We find that $P_n$ scales as $n^{-2} \ln n$, rather than the expected $n^{-2}$ for kink-kink collisions. This result is demonstrated analytically for even $n$ in square loops and numerically for all other cases. At lowest order, the effect of loop decays is to further enhance $P_n$ at large $n$ relative to its value at small $n$. The consequences for relic stochastic background radiation along with the caveats pertaining to our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>cp3-bench: A tool for benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms tested with cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce cp3-bench, a tool for comparing symbolic regression algorithms which we make publicly available at https://github.com/CP3-Origins/cp3-bench. Currently, cp3-bench includes 12 symbolic regression algorithms which can be automatically installed as part of cp3-bench. The philosophy behind cp3-bench is that it should be as user-friendly as possible, available in a ready-to-use format, and allow for easy additions of new algorithms and datasets. Our hope is that users of symbolic regression algorithms can use cp3-bench to easily install and compare symbolic regression algorithms to better decide which algorithms to use for their specific tasks at hand. To introduce and motivate the use of cp3-bench we present a benchmark of 12 symbolic regression algorithms applied to 28 datasets representing six different astrophysical setups. Overall, we find that most of the benched algorithms do poorly in the benchmark and suggest possible ways to proceed with developing algorithms that will be better at identifying ground truth expressions for cosmological datasets. Our demonstration benchmark studies the significance of dimensionality of the feature space and precision of datasets. We find both to be highly important for symbolic regression tasks to be successful. On the other hand, we find no indication that inter-dependence of features in datasets is important, i.e. it is not in general a hindrance for symbolic regression algorithms if datasets e.g. contain both $z$ and $H(z)$ as features. Lastly, we find no indication that performance of algorithms on standardized datasets are good indicators of performance on particular astrophysical datasets. This suggests that it is not necessarily prudent to choose symbolic regression algorithms based on their performance on standardized data. A more robust approach is to consider a variety of algorithms, chosen based on the particular task at hand.</description>

      <title>The Memory of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves, after they enter the horizon and decay away, leave a residual displacement in test particles: a memory, in analogy with gravitational waves generated by astrophysical sources. The late-time distance between test particles is related to the one at early times by $\xi^i_{\rm late} = \frac{a_{\rm late}}{a_{\rm early}} (\delta^i_j -\frac12 \bar h^i_j)\xi^j_{\rm early}$. Therefore, the deformation of an initial spherical shell does not depend on the cosmological evolution, but only on the primordial value $\bar h^i_{j}$ of the gravitational wave. The memory is thus related to the adiabatic tensor mode that maps the unperturbed FLRW geometries at early and late times; this is analogous to the relation between memory in Minkowski spacetime and the BMS group. The primordial memory is also connected to the consistency relations of cosmological correlators, as the flat-space memory is related to the soft theorems for gravitational wave emission. We comment on the signature of the effect on the CMB $B$-modes and on the large-scale structure. There is also a primordial memory effect that is subleading in the spatial gradients of the wave: it is encoded in the rotation of free-falling gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>
