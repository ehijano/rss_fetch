      <title>Restricted Spectral Gap Decomposition for Simulated Tempering Targeting Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated tempering is a widely used strategy for sampling from multimodal distributions. In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. We show that in fixed-dimensional settings, the algorithm's complexity scales polynomially with the separation between modes and logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Estimation methods of Matrix-valued AR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes novel estimation methods for the Matrix Autoregressive (MAR) model, specifically adaptations of the Yule-Walker equations and Burg's method, addressing limitations in existing techniques. The MAR model, by maintaining a matrix structure and requiring significantly fewer parameters than vector autoregressive (VAR) models, offers a parsimonious, yet effective, alternative for high-dimensional time series. Empirical results demonstrate that MAR models estimated via the proposed methods achieve a comparable fit to VAR models across metrics such as MAE and RMSE. These findings underscore the utility of Yule-Walker and Burg-type estimators in constructing efficient and interpretable models for complex temporal data.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed and Horseshoe priors for regression and sparse Besov rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large variety of functions encountered in nonparametric statistics, calls for methods that are flexible enough to achieve optimal or near-optimal performance over a wide variety of functional classes, such as Besov balls, as well as over a large array of loss functions. In this work, we show that a class of heavy-tailed prior distributions on basis function coefficients introduced in \cite{AC} and called Oversmoothed heavy-Tailed (OT) priors, leads to Bayesian posterior distributions that satisfy these requirements; the case of horseshoe distributions is also investigated, for the first time in the context of nonparametrics, and we show that they fit into this framework. Posterior contraction rates are derived in two settings. The case of Sobolev--smooth signals and $L_2$--risk is considered first, along with a lower bound result showing that the imposed form of the scalings on prior coefficients by the OT prior is necessary to get full adaptation to smoothness. Second, the broader case of Besov-smooth signals with $L_{p'}$--risks, $p' \geq 1$, is considered, and minimax posterior contraction rates, adaptive to the underlying smoothness, and including rates in the so-called {\em sparse} zone, are derived. We provide an implementation of the proposed method and illustrate our results through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>One-sample location tests based on center-outward signs and ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multivariate one-sample location test based on the center-outward ranks and signs is considered, and two different testing procedures are proposed for centrally symmetric distributions. The first test is based on a random division of the data into two samples, while the second one uses a symmetrized sample. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed tests are provided. For univariate data, two variants of the symmetrized test statistic are shown to be equivalent to the standard sign and Wilcoxon test respectively. The small sample behavior of the proposed techniques is illustrated by a simulation study that also provides a power comparison for various transportation grids.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Processes with Modified Lognormal Distribution Featuring Flexible Upper Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails. However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails, controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Generalization of In-Context Learning: A Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle, illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to capture distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Assimilative Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference (ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods, ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables. ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets. Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events.</description>

      <title>A Linear Approach to Data Poisoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require further training.</description>

      <title>Self-Boost via Optimal Retraining: An Analysis via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original, potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise regime.</description>

      <title>Policy Testing in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A packing lemma for VCN${}_k$-dimension and learning high-dimensional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$) $k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to high-arity.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Graphical Model-based Clustering: Robust Clustering using Bayesian Spanning Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture model-based framework is very popular for statistical inference on clustering. On the one hand, the model-based framework is convenient for producing probabilistic estimates of cluster assignments and uncertainty. On the other hand, the specification of a mixture model is fraught with the danger of misspecification that could lead to inconsistent clustering estimates. Graphical model-based clustering takes a different model specification strategy, in which the likelihood treats the data as arising dependently from a disjoint union of component graphs. To counter the large uncertainty of the graph, recent work on Bayesian spanning forest proposes using the integrated posterior of the node partition, marginalized over the latent edge distribution, to produce probabilistic estimates for clustering. Despite strong empirical performance, it is not yet known whether the clustering estimator is consistent, especially when the data-generating mechanism is different from the specified graphical model. This article gives a positive answer in the asymptotic regime: when the data arise from an unknown mixture distribution, under mild conditions, the posterior concentrates on the ground-truth partition, producing correct clustering estimates, including the number of clusters. Our result holds for both cases when the number of clusters is fixed or diverging as the sample size increases, and further provides a statistical upper bound of the misclassification rate. These theoretical results are encouraging developments for the model-based clustering literature, demonstrating the use of graphical models as a robust alternative to mixture models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state-action spaces remains challenging in scientific computing due to poor sample efficiency and lack of pathwise physical consistency. We introduce Differential Reinforcement Learning (Differential RL), a novel framework that reformulates RL from a continuous-time control perspective via a differential dual formulation. This induces a Hamiltonian structure that embeds physics priors and ensures consistent trajectories without requiring explicit constraints. To implement Differential RL, we develop Differential Policy Optimization (DPO), a pointwise, stage-wise algorithm that refines local movement operators along the trajectory for improved sample efficiency and dynamic alignment. We establish pointwise convergence guarantees, a property not available in standard RL, and derive a competitive theoretical regret bound of $O(K^{5/6})$. Empirically, DPO outperforms standard RL baselines on representative scientific computing tasks, including surface modeling, grid control, and molecular dynamics, under low-data and physics-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning with Differentially Private (Sliced) Wasserstein Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel framework for privately optimizing objectives that rely on Wasserstein distances between data-dependent empirical measures. Our main theoretical contribution is, based on an explicit formulation of the Wasserstein gradient in a fully discrete setting, a control on the sensitivity of this gradient to individual data points, allowing strong privacy guarantees at minimal utility cost. Building on these insights, we develop a deep learning approach that incorporates gradient and activations clipping, originally designed for DP training of problems with a finite-sum structure. We further demonstrate that privacy accounting methods extend to Wasserstein-based objectives, facilitating large-scale private training. Empirical results confirm that our framework effectively balances accuracy and privacy, offering a theoretically sound solution for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks relying on optimal transport distances such as Wasserstein distance or sliced-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Design-Based Inference under Random Potential Outcomes via Riesz Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01324</link>

Abstract: We introduce a design-based framework for causal inference that accommodates random potential outcomes, thereby extending the classical Neyman-Rubin model in which outcomes are treated as fixed. Each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a structural mapping $\tilde{y}_i(z, \omega)$, where $z$ denotes the treatment assignment and \(\omega\) represents latent outcome-level randomness. Inspired by recent connections between design-based inference and the Riesz representation theorem, we embed potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and define treatment effects as linear functionals, yielding estimators constructed via their Riesz representers. This approach preserves the core identification logic of randomised assignment while enabling valid inference under stochastic outcome variation. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence and develop consistent variance estimators that remain valid under weaker structural assumptions, including partially known dependence. A simulation study illustrates the robustness and finite-sample behaviour of the estimators. Overall, the framework unifies design-based reasoning with stochastic outcome modelling, broadening the scope of causal inference in complex experimental settings.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Equation Linking WAIC and WBIC in Singular Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational efficiency of model selection in singular models.</description>
