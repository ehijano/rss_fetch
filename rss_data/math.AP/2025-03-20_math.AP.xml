      <title>Elliptic systems in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces with critical sources in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the existence of non-trivial solutions to very general elliptic systems with critical non-linearities in the sense of embeddings in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. This allows to consider non-linearities which do not have polynomial growth. To achieve the existence, we combine a Mountain Pass Theorem without the Palais-Smale condition with the second Concentration Compactness Principle of Lions in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for symmetric hyperbolic Partial Differential Operators on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a complete Riemannian manifold, as well as time independent smooth lower order terms appearing in a first order symmetric perturbation of a Riemannian wave operator can be uniquely recovered, up to the natural obstructions, from a local source to solution map of the respective hyperbolic initial value problem. Our proofs are based on an adaptation of the classical Boundary Control method (BC-method) originally developed by Belishev and Kurylev. The BC-method reduces the PDE-based problem to a purely geometric problem involving the so-called travel time data. For each point in the manifold the travel time data contains the distance function from this point to any point in a fixed \textit{a priori} known compact observation set. It is well known that this geometric problem is solvable. The main novelty of this paper lies in our strategy to recover the lower order terms via a further adaptation of the BC-method.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Supersonic flows for the steady Euler-Poisson system in divergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the unique existence of an axisymmetric supersonic solution with nonzero vorticity and nonzero angular momentum density for the steady Euler-Poisson system in three-dimensional divergent nozzles when prescribing the velocity, strength of electric field, and the entropy at the entrance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the three-dimensional divergent nozzle problem for the steady Euler-Poisson system. We first solve the reformulated problem via the method of the Helmholtz decomposition and obtain a strong solution with a Sobolev norm. Then, using the fact that the longitudinal axis is the axis of the time-like variable, we apply the standard elliptic theory for the interior regularity to see that the solution is a classical solution. Furthermore, we deal carefully with singularity issues related to the polar angle on the axis of the divergent nozzle.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniqueness of Smooth Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equations from Critical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in dimension three and construct initial data in the critical space $BMO^{-1}$ from which there exist two distinct global solutions, both smooth for all $t&gt;0$. One consequence of this construction is the sharpness of the celebrated small data global well-posedness result of Koch and Tataru. This appears to be the first example of non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equations with data at the critical regularity. The proof is based on a non-uniqueness mechanism proposed by the second author in the context of the dyadic Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Blowup for the forced electron MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) contains a highly nonlinear Hall term with an interesting structure. Exploring the Hall nonlinear structure, we investigate possible phenomena of finite time blow up for the electron MHD with a (non-rough) forcing. When the magnetic field has zero horizontal components, the vertical component equation has a mixing feature with the mixer being the current flow. By constructing a magnetic field profile whose current density is approximately a hyperbolic flow near the origin, we show blowup develops in finite time. In another setting when the magnetic field is a shear type, the Hall term vanishes, and finite time blowup can be obtained for the forced electron MHD as well.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and optimal time-decay of 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and optimal time-decay of classical solutions for the 3-D full compressible Navier-Stokes system, which is given by the motion of the compressible viscous and heat-conductive gases. First of all, we study the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem to the system when the initial data is small enough. Secondly, we show the optimal decay rates of the higher-order spatial derivatives of the $\dot{H}^{-s}$ $\left(0\leq s&lt;\frac{3}{2}\right)$ negative Sobolev norms. Finally, under the assumption that the initial data is bounded in $L^{1}$-norm, we establish the upper and lower bounds of the optimal decay rates for the classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Riesz and reverse Riesz on Manifolds with Quadratically Decaying Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Riesz and reverse Riesz inequalities on manifolds whose Ricci curvature decays quadratically. First, we refine existing results on the boundedness of the Riesz transform by establishing a Lorentz-type endpoint estimate. We then explore the relationship between the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms, proving that the reverse Riesz, Hardy, and weighted Sobolev inequalities are essentially equivalent. Our approach relies on an asymptotic formula for the Riesz potential, combined with an extension of the so-called harmonic annihilation method.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional spherical transonic shock in a hemispherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and stability of a spherical transonic shock in a hemispherical shell under the three dimensional perturbations of the incoming flows and the exit pressure is established without any further restrictions on the background transonic shock solutions. The perturbed transonic shock are completely free and its strength and position are uniquely determined by the incoming flows and the exit pressure. A key issue in the analysis is the ``spherical projection coordinates" (i.e. the composition of the spherical coordinates and the stereographic projection), which provides an appropriate setting for the spherical transonic shock problem in the sense that the transformed equations have a similar structure as the steady Euler equations and do not contain any coordinates singularities. Then we decompose the hyperbolic and elliptic modes in the steady Euler equations in terms of the deformation and vorticity. An elaborate reformulation of the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions yields an unusual second order differential boundary condition on the shock front to the first order nonlocal deformation-curl system, from which an oblique boundary condition can be derived after homogenizing the curl system and introducing the potential function. The analysis of the compatibility conditions at the intersection of the shock front and the shell boundary is crucial for the optimal regularity of all physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Fourier Transform Associated with Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an exposition on the $L^2$ theory of the perturbed Fourier transform associated with a Schr\"odinger operator $H=-d^2/dx^2 +V$ on the real line, where $V$ is a real-valued \mbox{finite} measure. In the case $V\in L^1\cap L^2$, we explicitly define the perturbed Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}$ for $H$ and obtain an eigenfunction expansion theorem for square integrable functions. This provides a complete proof of the inversion formula for $\cF$ that covers the class of short range potentials in $(1+|x|)^{-\frac12-\eps} L^2 $. Such paradigm has applications in the study of scattering problems in connection with the spectral properties and asymptotic completeness of the wave operators.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of 3-solitary waves for the damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation: \begin{align*} \partial_{t}^2u-\Delta u+2\alpha \partial_{t}u+u-|u|^{p-1}u=0, \ &amp; (t,x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d, \end{align*} where $\alpha&gt;0$, $1\leq d\leq 5$ and energy sub-critical exponents $p&gt;2$. In this paper, we prove that 3-solitary waves behave as if the three solitons are on a line. Furthermore, the solitary waves have alternative signs and their distances are of order $\log{t}$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problems for Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this book, we present a curated collection of existing results on inverse problems for Mean Field Games (MFGs), a cutting-edge and rapidly evolving field of research. Our aim is to provide fresh insights, novel perspectives, and a comprehensive foundation for future investigations into this fascinating area. MFGs, a class of differential games involving a continuum of non-atomic players, offer a powerful framework for analyzing the collective behavior of large populations of symmetric agents as the number of agents approaches infinity. This framework has proven to be an invaluable tool for quantitatively modeling the macroscopic dynamics of agents striving to minimize specific costs in complex systems, such as crowd dynamics, financial markets, traffic flows, and social networks.
  The study of MFGs has traditionally focused on forward problems, where the goal is to determine the equilibrium behavior of agents given a set of model parameters, such as cost functions, interaction mechanisms, and initial conditions. However, the inverse problems for MFGs -- which seek to infer these underlying parameters from observed data -- have received comparatively less attention in the literature. This book seeks to address this gap by delving into the fundamental aspects of MFG inverse problems, with a particular emphasis on issues of unique identifiability, stability, and reconstruction of unknown parameters. These problems are not only mathematically challenging but also of immense practical significance, as they enable the calibration and validation of MFG models using real-world data.
  This book is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in the theory and applications of MFGs, particularly in inverse problems. Through this book, we hope to inspire further exploration and innovation in this dynamic and interdisciplinary area of study.</description>

      <title>Layer dynamics for the Allen-Cahn equation with nonlinear phase-dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the metastable dynamics of the solutions to the reaction-diffusion equation with nonlinear phase-dependent diffusion $u_t=\varepsilon^2(D(u)u_x)_x-f(u)$, where $D$ is a strictly positive function and $f$ is a bistable reaction term. We derive a system of ordinary differential equations describing the slow evolution of the metastable states, whose existence has been proved by Folino et al. (Z. Angew. Math. Phys., 2020). Such a system generalizes the one derived in the pioneering work of Carr and Pego (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 1989) to describe the metastable dynamics for the classical Allen-Cahn equation, which corresponds to the particular case $D\equiv1$.</description>

      <title>Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general non-uniqueness result for normalized ground states of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with pure power nonlinearity on bounded domains with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, defined as global minimizers of the associated energy functional among functions with prescribed mass. Precisely, for nonlinearity powers slightly smaller than the $L^2$-critical exponent, we prove that there always exists at least one value of the mass for which normalized ground states are not unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of singularities in a baby Skyrme type energy model, which describes magnetic solitons in two-dimensional ferromagnetic systems. In presence of a diverging anisotropy term, which enforces a preferred background state of the magnetization, we establish a weak compactness of its topological charge density, which converges to an atomic measure with quantized weights. We characterize the $\Gamma$-limit of the energies as the total variation of this measure. In the case of lattice type energies, we first need to carefully define a notion of discrete topological charge for $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued maps. We then prove a corresponding compactness and $\Gamma$-convergence result, thereby bridging the discrete and continuum theories.</description>

      <title>On a few counterexamples to solvability of the $div$ equation in domains with external cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the solvability of the equation $\mathrm{div} \ \mathbf{u} = f$ with a zero Dirichlet boundary condition for $\mathbf{u}$. A classical result establishes that for a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with a Lipschitz boundary and for $f \in L^p(\Omega)$ with zero mean value there exists a solution $\mathbf{u} \in (W_0^{1, p}(\Omega))^N$ for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ with the $W^{1,p}$ norm controlled by the $L^p$ norm of the right-hand side $f$. The results were extended to John domains and excluded the existence of the solution operator in domains with external cusps. Our aim is to specify at least some classes of the right-hand sides for which the problem cannot have a solution in the space $W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. We first extend the counterexample by Luc Tartar originally formulated for right-hand side functions in $\overline{L^2}$ in two space dimensions to a more general class of functions in $\overline{L^p}$ spaces and a more general type of singular domains. We then generalize this result to an arbitrary dimension $N$. Returning to two space dimensions, we investigate domains with boundary properties superior to those of previously studied H\"older continuous domains and construct counterexamples also in this situation.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Bakry [Lecture Notes in Math., 1994], we prove sharp hypercontractivity bounds of the heat flow $({\sf H}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ metric measure spaces. The best constant in this estimate involves the asymptotic volume ratio, and its optimality is obtained by means of the sharp $L^2$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ spaces. If equality holds in this sharp estimate for a prescribed time $t_0&gt;0$ and a non-zero extremizer $f$, it turns out that the ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ space has an $N$-Euclidean cone structure and ${\sf H}_{t_0}f$ is a Gaussian whose dilation factor is reciprocal to $t_0$ up to a multiplicative constant. Our results are new even on complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature, where a full characterization is provided for the equality case in the sharp hypercontractivity estimate of the heat flow.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of Contact Discontinuity Solutions and Vanishing Pressure Limit for the Aw-Rascle Traffic Flow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions and the vanishing pressure limit for the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model with general pressure functions. The well-posedness problem is formulated as a free boundary problem, where initial discontinuities propagate along linearly degenerate characteristics. By mollifying initial data in Lagrangian coordinates, the problem is reduced to analyzing the limit of classical solutions. To avoid equation degeneracy due to vacuum states, we establish a uniform lower bound for density by categorizing discontinuity types at singular points. Using level sets for velocity derivatives, we derive uniform estimates for density and velocity gradients. Through equivalence of coordinate transformations, the well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions in original coordinates is rigorously proven. Results show that compressive initial data induce finite-time singularity formation, while rarefactive initial data ensure global existence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions of the Aw-Rascle model converge to those of the pressureless model under vanishing pressure, with matching convergence rates for velocity and characteristic triangles. By enhancing regularity in non-discontinuous regions, we prove convergence of the Aw-Rascle model's blow-up time to the pressureless model's blow-up time. Finally, analogous results are extended to the Chaplygin gas pressure case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of an open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{S}^2$ for which the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian with Neumann boundary condition exceeds that of the geodesic disk having the same area. This example holds for large areas and contrasts with results by Bandle and later authors proving maximality of the disk under additional topological or geometric conditions, thereby revealing such conditions to be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate models of dispersive long internal waves with rotational effects, specifically the Benjamin-Ono (BO) and intermediate long wave (ILW) equations modified by the presence of the nonlocal operator $\partial_x^{-1}$, which mathematically accounts for rotational influences. We establish a local and global well-posedness theory while ensuring the unconditional uniqueness of solutions in low-regularity Sobolev-type spaces. Our approach is based on techniques introduced by Molinet and Vento in \cite{MR3397003}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the complex interpolation spaces of weighted vector-valued Sobolev spaces with and without boundary conditions on the half-space and on smooth bounded domains. The weights we consider are power weights that measure the distance to the boundary and do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. First, we determine the higher-order trace spaces for weighted vector-valued Besov, Triebel-Lizorkin, Bessel potential and Sobolev spaces. This allows us to derive a trace theorem for boundary operators and to interpolate spaces with boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive density results for weighted Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization Boundary-Control Policies for Stability and Invariance of Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals (BCBFal), from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. Sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers are derived in the case of traffic flow models with stability and invariance conditions.</description>

      <title>The Field Equations of Penalized non-Parametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We view penalized risks through the lens of the calculus of variations. We consider risks comprised of a fitness-term (e.g. MSE) and a gradient-based penalty. After establishing the Euler-Lagrange field equations as a systematic approach to finding minimizers of risks involving only first derivatives, we proceed to exemplify this approach to the MSE penalized by the integral over the squared l2-norm of the gradient of the regression function. The minimizer of this risk is given as the solution to a second order inhomogeneous PDE, where the inhomogeneity is given as the conditional expectation of the target variable conditioned on the features. We discuss properties of the field equations and practical implications thereof, which also apply to the classical Ridge penalty for linear models, and embed our findings into the existing literature. In particular, we find that we can recover the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model for image-denoising, if we consider the features as deterministic and evenly distributed. Last, we outline several directions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian surface of negative curvature, we prove a characterization for configurations of closed geodesics arising from one parameter Allen-Cahn min-max constructions. One of the facts we conclude is that every geodesic occurs with multiplicity one. As an application we obtain a uniform sharp lower bound for the first min-max width of closed hyperbolic surfaces and prove it is only attained asymptotically. Moreover, we compute the first width of the Bolza surface and of some hyperbolic surfaces with small systoles.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms on Broken Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study both the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms on broken line. This model can be described by $(-\infty, -1] \cup [1,\infty)$ equipped with the measure $d\mu = |r|^{d_{1}-1}dr$ for $r \le -1$ and $d\mu = r^{d_{2}-1}dr$ for $r\ge 1$, where $d_{1}, d_{2} &gt;1$. For the Riesz transform, we show that the range of its $L^{p}$ boundedness depends solely on the smaller dimension, $d_{1} \wedge d_{2}$. Furthermore, we establish a Lorentz type estimate at the endpoint. In our subsequent investigation, we consider the reverse Riesz inequality by rigorously verifying the $L^{p}$ lower bounds for the Riesz transform for almost every $p\in (1,\infty)$. Notably, unlike most previous studies, we do not assume the doubling condition or the Poincar\'e inequality. Our approach is based on careful estimates of the Riesz kernel and a method known as harmonic annihilation.</description>

      <title>Inferring diffusivity from killed diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion of independent molecules in an insulated Euclidean domain with unknown diffusivity parameter. At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\"odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize a general traveling periodic wave of the defocusing mKdV (modified Korteweg--de Vries) equation by using a quotient of products of Jacobi's elliptic theta functions. Compared to the standing periodic wave of the defocusing NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameter solution form with the scaling transformation. Eigenfunctions of the Lax system for the general traveling periodic wave are also characterized as quotients of products of Jacobi's theta functions. As the main outcome of our analytical computations, we derive a new solution of the defocusing mKdV equation which describes the kink breather propagating on a general traveling wave background.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle solutions to the 1D nonlocal Fisher--KPP equation with a fractal time derivative in the weak diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing quasiparticle-like asymptotic solutions within the weak diffusion approximation for the generalized population Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (Fisher--KPP) equation, which incorporates nonlocal quadratic competitive losses and a fractal time derivative of non-integer order $\alpha$, where $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$. This approach is based on the semiclassical approximation and the principles of the Maslov method. The fractal time derivative is introduced in the framework of $F^{\alpha}$-calculus. The Fisher--KPP equation is decomposed into a system of nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of interacting quasiparticles within classes of trajectory-concentrated functions. A key element in constructing approximate quasiparticle solutions is the interplay between the dynamical system of quasiparticle moments and an auxiliary linear system of equations, which is coupled with the nonlinear system. General constructions are illustrated through examples that examine the effect of the fractal parameter $\alpha$ on quasiparticle behavior.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current investigation aims to study the stochastic-periodic homogenization for a family of functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands defined on Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. It focuses on the concept of stochastic two-scale convergence in this type of spaces, which is a combination of both well-known periodic two-scale convergence and stochastic two-scale convergence in the mean schemes. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the stochastic two-scale convergence method to the Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. Moreover, it is shown, by the stochastic two-scale convergence method, that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving convex functionals converges to the minimizers of a homogenized problem with a suitable convex integrand.</description>

      <title>Lipolysis on Lipid Droplets: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Discretisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lipolysis is a life-essential metabolic process, which supplies fatty acids stored in lipid droplets to the body in order to match the demands of building new cells and providing cellular energy.
  In this paper, we present a first mathematical modelling approach for lipolysis, which takes into account that the involved enzymes act on the surface of lipid droplets. We postulate an active region near the surface where the substrates are within reach of the surface-bound enzymes and formulate a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs, which connect the active region to the inner core of lipid droplets via interface conditions.
  We establish two numerical discretisations based on finite element method and isogeometric analysis, and validate them to perform reliably. Since numerical tests are best performed on non-zero explicit stationary state solutions, we introduce and analyse a model, which describes besides lipolysis also a reverse process (yet in a physiologically much oversimplified way). The system is not coercive such that establishing well-posedness is a non-standard task. We prove the unique existence of global and equilibrium solutions. We establish exponential convergence to the equilibrium solutions using the entropy method. We then study the stationary state model and compute explicitly for radially symmetric solutions. Concerning the finite element methods, we show numerically the linear and quadratic convergence of the errors with respect to the $H^{1}$- and $L^{2}$-norms, respectively.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations of a prototypical PDE model of lipolysis and illustrate that ATGL clustering on lipid droplets can significantly slow down lipolysis.</description>

      <title>On the optimal rate of vortex stretching for axisymmetric Euler flows without swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For axisymmetric flows without swirl and compactly supported initial vorticity, we prove the upper bound of $t^{4/3}$ for the growth of the vorticity maximum, which was conjectured by Childress [Phys. D, 2008] and supported by numerical computations from Childress--Gilbert--Valiant [J. Fluid Mech. 2016]. The key is to estimate the velocity maximum by the kinetic energy together with conserved quantities involving the vorticity.</description>

      <title>Global Stabilization for the BBM-KP equations on R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present results on the energy decay of the BBM-KP equations (I and II) posed on $\R^2$ with localized damping. This model offers an alternative to the KP equations, analogous to how the regularized long-wave equation relates to the classical Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. We show that the energy associated with the Cauchy problem decays exponentially when a localized dissipative mechanism is present in a subdomain. Finally, we validate the theoretical results on the exponential stabilization of solutions to the BBM-KP equations with damping through numerical experiments using a spectral-finite difference scheme.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness in Low-regularity Weighted Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness within low-regularity weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide sharp a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria.
  The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>A new framework for Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory and its application to planar Choquard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the planar logarithmic Choquard equation $$- \Delta u + a(x)u + (\log|\cdot| \ast u^2)u = 0,\qquad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2$$ in the strongly indefinite and possibly degenerate setting where no sign condition is imposed on the linear potential $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular, we shall prove the existence of a sequence of high energy solutions to this problem in the case where $a$ is invariant under $\mathbb{Z}^2$-translations.
  The result extends to a more general $G$-equivariant setting, for which we develop a new variational approach which allows us to find critical points of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann type. In particular, our method resolves the problem that the energy functional $\Phi$ associated with the logarithmic Choquard equation is only defined on a subspace $X \subset H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with the property that $\|\cdot\|_X$ is not translation invariant. The new approach is based on a new $G$-equivariant version of the Cerami condition and on deformation arguments adapted to a family of suitably constructed scalar products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_u$, $u \in X$ with the $G$-equivariance property $\langle g \ast v , g \ast w \rangle_{g \ast u} = \langle v , w \rangle_u.$</description>

      <title>Chain-structure solutions to a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of ground states and high-energy solutions to the following Schr\"odinger-Poisson system
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta u + a(x) u + u v = 0,\newline
  \Delta v = u^2,
  \end{cases}
  \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{align*}
  where $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$ is nonnegative and radially symmetric in the first two variables. Differing from the standard approach, our framework yields chain-structure solutions, i.e. solutions periodic in the third variable. A central part of this work is the construction of the Green function of a Poisson problem subject to periodic boundary conditions and we show that its asymptotic profile is tightly related to both the two and three dimensional Poisson problems in the entire space. If the potential $a$ is constant along the third variable, we apply symmetry techniques to construct solutions that have nonvanishing derivative in the third variable.</description>

      <title>Computation of Miura surfaces with gradient Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Miura surfaces are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear elliptic system of equations. This system is derived by homogenization from the Miura fold, which is a type of origami fold with multiple applications in engineering. A previous inquiry, gave suboptimal conditions for existence of solutions and proposed an $H^2$-conformal finite element method to approximate them. In this paper, the existence of Miura surfaces is studied using a gradient formulation. It is also proved that, under some hypotheses, the constraints propagate from the boundary to the interior of the domain. Then, a numerical method based on a stabilized least-square formulation, conforming finite elements and a Newton method is introduced to approximate Miura surfaces. The numerical method is proved to converge and numerical tests are performed to demonstrate its robustness.</description>
