      <title>A multiscale model of friction considering the influence of third-body wear particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting friction in sliding interfaces that contain third body wear particles is critical for engineering applications such as sliding movement in pistons, bearings, or metal forming. We present a hierarchical multiscale framework that links particle scale mechanics to macroscopic friction in a strip draw friction test. At the macroscale, a one dimensional finite element model reproduces the global stress state of the strip draw setup and updates the local wear particle density via Archard's law. The local friction force at each node is then computed from mesoscale simulation results. At the mesoscale, a coupled discrete element boundary element approach resolves load sharing between rough surfaces and rigid oblate spheroidal wear particles. The mesoscale solution returns to the macroscale solver a friction coefficient that depends on normal pressure, sliding velocity, surface geometry, and particle density, thereby closing the loop between scales. The simulated friction coefficient matches strip draw experiments, capturing both the observed decrease in friction with increasing normal pressure and the influence of tool pad size.</description>

      <title>Molecularly imprinted nanopores for multiplexed sensing, release, and in-edge computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nanopore technology, the development of multiplexed detection and release platforms with high spatial and temporal resolution remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty in distinguishing signals originating from different nanopores in a single chip. In this work, we present a solid-state nanopore system functionalized with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective detection and controlled release of neurotransmitters. We designed a nanopore array where each nanopore is functionalized with a specific MIP able to recognize specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and histamine, respectively). The platform demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, recovery, and stability. Multiplexed detection with high spatiotemporal resolution of the order of 100 ms/ 3 {\mu}m was achieved by specifically depositing MIPs and conductive hydrogels on different nanopores prepared on a single solid-state membrane. The employment of micro-chambers for each nanopore prevented signal cross-talk, thereby enabling simultaneous detection and release of multiple neurotransmitters. Moreover, we demonstrated computing with different logic gates and in-edge computing. This nanopore platform represents a radically novel approach towards hybrid solid-state nanopores able to perform real-time label-free multiplex detection, controlled biomolecule release, and ionic logic computing, addressing key challenges in neurochemical sensing and bio-computation.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Machine Learning for Predicting Biomass-Derived Hard Carbon Anode Performance in Sodium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomass-derived hard carbon has become the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high capacity and excellent cycling stability. However, the effects of synthesis parameters and structural features on hard carbon's (HC) electrochemical performance are still unclear, requiring time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental investigations. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by training on large datasets to predict hard carbon performance more efficiently, saving time and resources. In this study, four ML models were used to predict the capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC. Data augmentation based on the TabPFN technique was employed to improve model robustness under limited data conditions, and the relationships between features and electrochemical performance were examined. Notably, the XGBoost model achieved an R2 of 0.854 and an RMSE of 23.290 mAh g-1 for capacity prediction, and an R2 of 0.868 and an RMSE of 3.813% for ICE prediction. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses identified carbonization temperature (Temperature_2) as the most important factor influencing both capacity and ICE. Furthermore, we used bamboo as the precursor to synthesize four hard carbons based on the predictive approach. The electrochemical performance of these samples closely matched our predictions. By leveraging machine-learning approach, this study provides an efficient framework for accelerating the screening process of biomass-derived hard carbon candidates.</description>

      <title>Compact Continuous Cold Atomic Beam from a Single Cell with 3D Cooling and Ultra-low Light Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a compact single-cell source of a continuous cold-atom beam with three-dimensional (3D) cooling. By integrating an off-axis moving optical molasses (OM) with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), we achieve simultaneous 3D cooling within a 50 mm interaction region. The source delivers a continuous flux up to 4.9(5)x10^9 atoms/s, with a transverse temperature of 94(5) microK, a longitudinal temperature as low as 231(65) microK, and a tunable mean velocity between 5 and 20 m/s. Custom in-vacuum mirrors integrate the reflective geometry for the off-axis OM beams with a 0.8 mm output aperture, ensuring stable alignment while suppressing stray light and fluorescence leakage. Ultra-low light shift and decoherence are verified via continuous Raman-Ramsey interferometry, yielding a light shift of -0.51(4)Hz and a typical fringe contrast of 90.85(30)% at a Raman separation of 100 mm (interrogation time of 8.70 ms). This compact continuous cold-atom beam source constitutes a practical building block for atomic-beam clocks and interferometers, enabling reduced aliasing noise together with improved sensitivity and accuracy for field applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Resistive Pulse Signatures in Nanopores by Accurately Modeling Access Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistive pulse sensing is used to characterize and count single particles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with nanoscale pores providing enough spatial resolution for single-molecule identification and sequencing. This technique relies on measuring the ionic current drop produced by the passage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage signal into molecular dimensions. However, no generalized model exists that considers the resistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when obstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes featuring low aspect ratio pores. In this work, a general method by which to model the resistance of access regions in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented. Thin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer their conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our model accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and finite-length pores in the presence of simple or complex structures positioned at varying distances from the pore opening. The model is shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for obstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A model-based web app was created to predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries translocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model and accompanying tool will help guide future experimental designs and thus present a straightforward way to extend the quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Review on spin-wave RF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review explores the development of spin-wave technology, highlighting magnonics as a promising route for radio frequency (RF) communication systems. The rollout of 5G and the upcoming 6G networks intensifies the demand for devices that can operate at higher frequencies while remaining scalable, compact, and energy-efficient - requirements that spin waves are well suited to meet. The first two sections revisit the fundamentals of magnonics, trace major milestones in spin-wave research, and summarize recent advances in materials and device design. The third section reviews RF applications studied over the past 50 years, with emphasis on key passive components, such as filters, limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, and directional couplers. The final section discusses both the advantages and the open challenges of spin-wave devices, including insertion losses, linearity, and power handling, together with the strategies to address them. By linking fundamental insights with technological needs, this review outlines a path toward practical RF platforms. Spin-wave-based devices, with their scalability, versatility, and potential for low-power operation, hold strong promise for future wireless communication, particularly in the 5G and 6G era.</description>

      <title>Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Lateral and Vertical Beta-Ga2O3 Photoconductive Switches via Intrinsic and Extrinsic Optical Triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with its ultra-wide bandgap (approximately 4.8 eV) and high breakdown field (approximately 8 MV per cm), is a leading candidate for photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSSs) in high-power and high-speed pulsed applications. This work, for the first time, presents a systematic experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1 and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation, which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3 PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>
