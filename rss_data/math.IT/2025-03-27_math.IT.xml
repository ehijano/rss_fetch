      <title>New constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes via simple-root cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern storage technologies, symbol-pair codes have emerged as a crucial framework for addressing errors in channels where symbols are read in overlapping pairs to guard against pair errors. A symbol-pair code that meets the Singleton-type bound is called a maximum distance separable (MDS) symbol-pair code. MDS symbol-pair codes are optimal in the sense that they have the highest pair error-correcting capability. In this paper, we focus on new constructions of MDS symbol-pair codes using simple-root cyclic codes. Specifically, three new infinite families of $(n, d_P)_q$-MDS symbol-pair codes are obtained: (1) $(n=4q+4,d_P=7)_q$ for $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$; (2) $(n=4q-4,d_P=8)_q$ for $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$; (3) $(n=2q+2,d_P=9)_q$ for $q$ being an odd prime power. The first two constructions are based on analyzing the solutions of certain equations over finite fields. The third construction arises from the decomposition of cyclic codes, where we utilize the orthogonal relationships between component codes and their duals to rigorously exclude the presence of specific codewords. It is worth noting that for the pair distance $d_P=7$ or $8$, our $q$-ary MDS symbol-pair codes achieve the longest known code length when $q$ is not a prime. Furthermore, for $d_P=9$, our codes attain the longest code length regardless of whether $q$ is prime or not.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information-Empowered Task-Oriented Communication: Principles, Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI)-based guidelines have recently proven to be effective for designing task-oriented communication systems, where the ultimate goal is to extract and transmit task-relevant information for downstream task. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of MI-empowered task-oriented communication, highlighting how MI-based methods can serve as a unifying design framework in various task-oriented communication scenarios. We begin with the roadmap of MI for designing task-oriented communication systems, and then introduce the roles and applications of MI to guide feature encoding, transmission optimization, and efficient training with two case studies. We further elaborate the limitations and challenges of MI-based methods. Finally, we identify several open issues in MI-based task-oriented communication to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Phase-Only Zero-Forcing for Secure Wireless Communication in Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial noise (AN) transmission is a physical layer security technique in multi-antenna wireless communication systems. Synthetic noise is broadcast to all receivers except designated legitimate users via beamforming in the legitimate users' null space. We consider AN transmission employing a single RF chain and analog beamforming, where beamforming vectors maintain constant magnitude while allowing arbitrary phases. Our primary objective is to design a constant-magnitude vector capable of nullifying multiple users' channel vectors simultaneously. To tackle this zero-forcing problem, we propose a novel successive partition zero-forcing (SPZF) scheme, which transforms the multi-user zero-forcing task into optimizing channel partitioning to minimize outage probability. The SPZF scheme can be generalized to any number of users, but our analysis focuses on the two-user case. Theoretical analysis reveals that our proposed SPZF scheme can attain arbitrarily low outage probability in the limit of large number of transmit antenna. We present three partition algorithms (random, iterative, and genetic) to minimize the outage probability. The outage probabilities and secrecy rates of the three partition algorithms are compared via numerical simulations. We find that the more advanced partition algorithms (iterative and genetic) achieve higher secrecy rates than the random algorithm, particularly under conditions of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), large number of eavesdroppers, or small number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>Power Minimization for NOMA-assisted Pinching Antenna Systems With Multiple Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of pinching antenna systems with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising technique for future 6G applications. This paper is the first to investigate power minimization for NOMA-assisted pinching antenna systems utilizing multiple dielectric waveguides. We formulate a total power minimization problem constrained by each user's minimum data requirements, addressing a classical challenge. To efficiently solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interference function of this algorithm is standard, ensuring convergence to a unique fixed point. Numerical simulations validate that our developed algorithm converges within a few steps and significantly outperforms benchmark strategies across various data rate requirements. The results also indicate that the minimum transmit power, as a function of the interval between the waveguides, exhibits an approximately oscillatory decay with a negative trend.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications via Features Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the new generation of wireless technologies (6G) has led to an increased interest in semantic communication. Thanks also to recent developments in artificial intelligence and communication technologies, researchers in this field have defined new communication paradigms that go beyond those of syntactic communication to post-Shannon and semantic communication. However, there is still need to define a clear and practical framework for semantic communication, as well as an effective structure of semantic elements that can be used in it. The aim of this work is to bridge the gap between two post-Shannon communication paradigms, and to define a robust and effective semantic communication strategy that focuses on a dedicated semantic element that can be easily derived from any type of message. Our work will take form as an innovative communication method called identification via semantic features, which aims at exploiting the ambiguities present in semantic messages, allowing for their identification instead of reproducing them bit by bit. Our approach has been tested through numerical simulations using a combination of machine learning and data analysis. The proposed communication method showed promising results, demonstrating a clear and significant gain over traditional syntactic communication paradigms.</description>

      <title>The problem of infinite information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conditional mutual information (cMI) between a pair of variables $X,Y$ given a third one $Z$ and derived quantities including transfer entropy (TE) and causation entropy (CE) in the dynamically relevant context where $X=T(Y,Z)$ is determined by $Y,Z$ via a deterministic transformation $T$. Under mild continuity assumptions on their distributions, we prove a zero-infinity dichotomy for cMI for a wide class of $T$, which gives a yes-or-no answer to the question of information flow as quantified by TE or CE. Such an answer fails to distinguish between the relative amounts of information flow. To resolve this problem, we propose a discretization strategy and a conjectured formula to discern the \textit{relative ambiguities} of the system, which can serve as a reliable proxy for the relative amounts of information flow. We illustrate and validate this approach with numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>Consensus Capacity of Noisy Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study communication with consensus over a broadcast channel - the receivers reliably decode the sender's message when the sender is honest, and their decoder outputs agree even if the sender acts maliciously. We characterize the broadcast channels which permit this byzantine consensus and determine their capacity. We show that communication with consensus is possible only when the broadcast channel has embedded in it a natural ''common channel'' whose output both receivers can unambiguously determine from their own channel outputs. Interestingly, in general, the consensus capacity may be larger than the point-to-point capacity of the common channel, i.e., while decoding, the receivers may make use of parts of their output signals on which they may not have consensus provided there are some parts (namely, the common channel output) on which they can agree.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Interpretable Neural Learning based on Local Information-Theoretic Goal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of biological and artificial networks, an intuitive understanding of how their local learning dynamics contribute to network-level task solutions remains a challenge to this date. Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce 'infomorphic' neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.</description>

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication meets the Submodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean conjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q in terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of combinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any query Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial algorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often involve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data partitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze the complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.
  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best complexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix multiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial techniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion of submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width that naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We describe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time corresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q. We show that our framework recovers the best known complexities for Boolean queries that have been studied in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and also discovers new algorithms for some classes of queries that improve upon the best known complexities.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrate and fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>
