      <title>Statistical study of the transcript of vote counts in multi-member constituencies: Identifying electoral fraud and reconstructing voting returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new methods of electoral statistics. With their help, we study transcripts of vote counting in municipal elections. We construct and apply effective statistical tests to detect the ballot stuffing at the level of individual candidates and ballots as a whole. We study the difference between falsifications for the administration and against the opposition. We construct indicators assessing the credibility of transcripts as a whole. We propose a model of voter behavior to reconstruct the results of multi-member voting at the level of an individual precinct. We carry out an independent verification of the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Heavy-Ion Physics: A Data-Driven Analysis of Quark Matter Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven analysis of Quark Matter conferences from 2011 to 2025, investigating trends in geographical representation, research emphasis, and methodological strategies. Using a dataset of over 10,000 presentations, the evolution of heavy-ion physics through its premier conference series is examined. The distribution of presentations across countries and institutions shows the global reach of the field while highlighting opportunities for broader international engagement. Research topics show clear temporal trends, with certain physics concepts rising and falling in prominence, and a gradual shift from facility-focused to phenomenon-focused research. The analysis reveals increasing integration between theoretical and experimental approaches over time, reflecting a maturing field where these complementary domains strengthen and enhance each other. These findings provide quantitative insights that the evolution of heavy-ion physics is strengthened by international collaboration at conferences. The analytical methods developed here could help other scientific communities understand their own patterns of knowledge sharing and development.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Physics of Wealth Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asset exchange models (AEMs) provide a physics-inspired framework for studying wealth formation. These models capture wealth distribution dynamics via pairwise money exchanges, yielding steady-state distributions from exponential to heavy-tailed power laws. However, empirical validation remains limited due to scarce real-world transaction data. Here, we bridge this gap by analyzing spectral properties of Markov transition matrices from both AEMs and Ethereum blockchain data, enabling quantitative comparison of model and empirical exchange dynamics. We assess thermodynamic equilibrium in exchange processes - specifically, detailed balance - and derive steady-state wealth distributions from transition matrices. We find that equilibrium systems' spectra contain only real eigenvalues and link Ethereum price changes to spectral shifts. We also investigate external factors (e.g., taxes), showing that advantages for richer individuals make wealth evolution path-dependent on initial distributions. Our work establishes a quantitative framework for validating AEMs with real data, advancing economic modeling and understanding of wealth formation.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the EEG brain mapping technique based on the Duffing oscillator. For this purpose, we used EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members in a music experiment. The Duffing oscillator was used to detect weak signals in the EEG signals. The frequency values of the weak signal were searched between 12 Hz and 37 Hz in all EEG channels of the participants. Then, topographical maps of the brain were generated according to the numbers of these weak signals detected. The results show that Duffing oscillator-based weak signal detection is a very effective tool for brain mapping. It shows that this method has great potential to help study various pathological conditions and understand the cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Recurrent visitations expose the paradox of human mobility in the 15-Minute City vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transition towards sustainability and equity, proximity-centred planning has been adopted in cities worldwide. Exemplified by the 15-Minute City, this emerging planning paradigm assumes that spatially proximate provision translates into localised use, yet evidence on actual behaviour remains limited. We advance a behaviourally grounded assessment by introducing the K-Visitation framework, which identifies the minimal set of distinct visited places needed to cover essential amenities under two orderings: one based observed visitation frequency ($K_{\text{freq}}$) and the other based on proximity to home ($K_{\text{dist}}$). Applying it to a 18-month, anonymised mobility data from Finland, we directly compare local mobility potentials with habitual destination choices. We find systematic misalignment between proximity and behaviour, and this is most pronounced in metropolitan cores--areas traditionally viewed as ideal settings for local living--where residents voluntarily overshoot nearby options, while peripheral routines remain more locally constrained. The misalignment further revealed uneven amenity type influences, as distance differentials increase from everyday to specialised amenity. Furthermore, the social consequences of localism are spatially contingent: increased reliance on local options reduces experienced segregation in central districts but can exacerbate it elsewhere. The results stress that proximity is therefore necessary but insufficient for achieving the proximity living ideal; implementation should be behaviourally informed and place-sensitive, coupling abundant local provision of routine needs with access enhancement to specialised amenities to avoid unintended equity trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning-Driven Adaptive Rewiring for Cooperative Control in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01057v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation, creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns, we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels, revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.</description>

      <title>Local asymmetry in spatial interactions: A generalized slide-vector approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptualization of space is crucial for comprehending the processes that shape geographic phenomena. Functional space exhibits asymmetric spatial separations, which deviate from the symmetry axiom of metric space commonly adopted as a representation of the geographical space. However, existing literature has paid scant attention to the issue of asymmetry of spatial separation. Technically, spatial models and analysis methods grounded in a Euclidean representation of the geographical space have their capability to handle the functional space of geographical phenomena restricted by the inherency of the symmetry axiom. In this study, we aim at differentiating and characterizing the spatial dependency and heterogeneity of asymmetric spatial separations. Specifically, we propose a local slide-vector model based on spatially constrained multi-dimensional unfolding. The model takes account of spatial dependency and heterogeneity of asymmetry and can capture local asymmetric structures of spatial separations. Furthermore, we examine the dynamics of local asymmetric structures and introduce a potential field method to infer inter-regional asymmetries. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to study the spatial separations derived from U.S. interstate migration data. Our approach sheds light on the distortion of geographic space from the perspective of migrants' relocation preferences and improves the understanding of domestic human migration patterns.</description>

      <title>An affinity based opinion dynamics model for the evolving pattern of political polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political polarization has been a subject that has attracted many studies in recent years. We have developed an opinion dynamics model with affective homophily effect and national social norm effect to describe this phenomenon. The time evolution of the polarization between the two parties and the spread of opinions within each party are affected by three factors: the repulsive effect between the two parties, the attractive and repulsive effects between the members in each party, and the national social norm effect that pulls the opinions of all members towards a common norm. The model is internally consistent and is applied to the simulation of the symmetric patterns of polarization and spread of the opinion distributions in the U.S. Congress and the results align well with 154 years of recorded data. The time evolution of the strength of the national social norm effect is obtained and is consistent with the important historical events occurred during the past one and half century.</description>

      <title>Scale-free Points-of-Interest Distribution in a City Emerging from Homogeneous Poissonian-point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban systems often exhibit scale-invariant properties, with power-law distributions observed in various spatial and temporal patterns of human behavior. A prominent example is the distribution of commercial activities and other Points of Interest (POIs) across cities. However, the mechanisms by which such heavy-tailed behaviors emerge from local urban dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that global inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution of POIs can arise from the aggregation of locally homogeneous processes.
  Using Foursquare data from the city of Bologna, we show that POI distributions exhibit clear power-law scaling when analyzed at city scale. We develop a theoretical framework in which this behavior naturally emerges from spatial clusters defined by shared intensity levels across disjoint areas, rather than spatial contiguity. By analytically and empirically linking these local processes to the observed global distribution, we provide a generative explanation for the emergence of scale-free patterns in urban commercial structure.
  To further relax the assumptions underlying the purely spatial model, and to account for the empirical observation that areas with similar activity intensity can be spatially disjoint, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical approach that combines spatial clustering with statistical heterogeneity across regions of comparable density, modeled via Poisson mixtures. This enables us to capture real-world deviations from local regularity while preserving interpretability.
  Our findings highlight a key insight: complex global phenomena in cities can arise from the spatial superposition of simple, locally uniform dynamics. This connection between micro-level homogeneity and macro-scale complexity offers new tools for interpreting, modeling, and classifying urban space.</description>

      <title>Cultural tightness and social cohesion under evolving norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful collective action on issues from climate change to the maintenance of democracy depends on societal properties such as cultural tightness and social cohesion. How these properties evolve is not well understood because they emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are usually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a game-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the coevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and norm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and preferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a proliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal properties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can simultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the degree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and reduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the extent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of social homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a population fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different characteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to cooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences for conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have implications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and collective action in times of crisis.</description>

      <title>Analysing contrarian behaviour using nonlinear biased $q$-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of contrarians in a recently proposed weighted-influence variant of the $q$-voter model. In this framework, non-unanimous influence groups affect the focal agent through weighted contributions governed by a bias parameter $p$. We extend this setting by introducing a fraction $\alpha$ ($\alpha&gt; 0$) of contrarians, defined as agents who systematically oppose the prevailing influence irrespective of whether the group is unanimous or divided. Analytical mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the final states of the system are governed by simple phase boundaries: regions of positive and negative majority separated by the lines $p=1/2$ and $\alpha=1/2$, with equally-mixed states confined to these boundaries. While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the bias, higher values of $\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a balanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the presence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions and extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings highlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress consensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately hinder a perfectly even split.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Compliant Formulation for Network Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network. Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, data and information have become overabundant resources within a global network of machines that exchange signals at speeds approaching that of light. In this highly saturated environment, communication has emerged as the most central form of interaction, supported by a rapidly evolving technical infrastructure. These new communication tools have created an overwhelming surplus of information so much so that no human could process it all. In response, platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Google use algorithms to filter and suggest content. These algorithms act as sorting mechanisms, reducing the informational noise and presenting users with content tailored to their habits and preferences. However, by placing themselves between users and data, these platforms gain control over what users see and, in doing so, shape their preferences and behaviors. In physical terms, we might say they function like selective filters or control gates in an information system directing flows and creating feedback loops. Over time, this can lead to a kind of informational inertia, where users become increasingly shaped by algorithmic influence and lose the ability to form independent judgments. This process reflects a broader trend that Bernard Stiegler describes as a new kind of proletarianization where individuals lose the knowledge and skills that are absorbed and automated by digital systems. Borrowing from physics, we study this as a shift toward higher entropy. However, platforms like Wikipedia and arXiv demonstrate how digital tools can support collective knowledge without leading to cognitive degradation. Inspired by Elinor Ostrom work on commons, we propose a model for a digital commons economy where information is shared and governed collaboratively, helping to restore a balance between entropy and organization in our digital environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Quantum Brush, an open-source digital painting tool that harnesses quantum computing to generate novel artistic expressions. The tool includes four different brushes that translate strokes into unique quantum algorithms, each highlighting a different way in which quantum effects can produce novel aesthetics. Each brush is designed to be compatible with the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as demonstrated by executing them on IQM's Sirius device.</description>

      <title>Inference of epidemic networks: the effect of different data types</title>

Abstract: We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.</description>

      <title>Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Ride-pooling adoption model for $\mathrm{CO_2}$ emission estimation</title>

Abstract: With the climate emergency and growing challenges ranging from pollution to congestion, ride-pooling (rp) has been floated as a potential solution for less congested, low-carbon and more space-efficient urban transportation. However, it is unclear which system configurations will enable an economically viable case for shared pooled mobility. To develop a more profound comprehension of the mechanisms underlying this subject, we here develop a simplified model to analyze the switching potential and \coo emissions of ride-pooling systems for a specified number of transport users, road network topology, and other system parameter values. This analysis is conducted across a broad range of switching probability functions (defined as the probability that a car or public transport user switches to ride-pooling) between an upper and lower bound of switching behaviour assumptions. Based on current Berlin parameters and the basic switching probability function, we find that ride-pooling can reduce the carbon emissions resulting from local transportation in Berlin by approximately 39\%. Policies that reduce the time factor - such as the provision of priority lanes - have the greatest effect in encouraging ride-pooling. For the system to be efficient and achieve measurable reductions in carbon emissions, the fleet size must be large enough. Across the range of switching probability functions, our results demonstrate that a fleet of 6,000 to 23,000 minibuses would be optimal to serve Berlin and reduce system-wide emissions.</description>

      <title>Will anyone review this paper? Screening, sorting, and the feedback cycles that imperil peer review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scholarly publishing relies on peer review to identify the best science. Yet finding willing and qualified reviewers to evaluate manuscripts has become an increasingly challenging task, possibly even threatening the long-term viability of peer review as an institution. What can or should be done to salvage it? Here, we develop mathematical models to reveal the intricate interactions among incentives faced by authors, reviewers, and readers in their endeavors to identify the best science. Two facets are particularly salient. First, peer review partially reveals authors' private sense of their work's quality through their decisions of where to send their manuscripts. Second, journals' reliance on traditionally unpaid and largely unrewarded review labor deprives them of a standard market mechanism -- wages -- to recruit additional reviewers when review labor is in short supply. We highlight a resulting feedback loop that threatens to overwhelm the peer review system: (1) an increase in submissions overtaxes the pool of suitable peer reviewers; (2) the accuracy of review drops because journals either must either solicit assistance from less qualified reviewers or ask current reviewers to do more; (3) as review accuracy drops, submissions further increase as more authors try their luck at venues that might otherwise be a stretch. We illustrate how this cycle is further propelled by forces including the increasing emphasis on high-impact publications, the proliferation of journals, and competition among these journals for peer reviews. Finally, we suggest interventions that could slow or even reverse this cycle of peer-review meltdown.</description>

      <title>Policy, Risk, and Norms Shape Collective Behaviors Worldwide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Societal responses to environmental change vary widely, even under comparable shocks, reflecting differences in both policy measures and public reactions shaped by cultural and socioeconomic contexts. We examine mask-wearing dynamics across 47 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic using a process-based, utility-driven model of individual behavior with three evolving drivers: policy stringency, disease risk, and social norms to understand emergent collective behavior. Calibrated with daily data on mask usage, COVID-19 deaths, and policy mandates, the model reproduces diverse national trajectories with minimal complexity. Differences in the decision weights assigned to policy and norms are critical for explaining variation, while risk and policy weights correlate with cultural and socioeconomic indicators. Norm weights, by contrast, are distributed more evenly across contexts. Our findings demonstrate how mechanistic models can uncover the processes shaping collective behavior, enabling policymakers to anticipate the magnitude and timing of behavioral change and design more effective, context-sensitive interventions.</description>

      <title>Epidemiological dynamics with clinically-derived infectiousness and incubation time courses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.08345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better predict the dynamics of epidemics such as COVID-19, it is important not only to investigate the network of local and long-range contagious contacts but also to understand the temporal dynamics of infectiousness and detectable symptoms. Here, we present a model of infection spread in a well-mixed group of individuals, which usually corresponds to a node in large-scale epidemiological networks. The model uses delay equations that take into account the duration of infection and are based on experimentally derived time courses of viral load and shedding, as well as the detectability of symptoms. We show that due to an early onset of infectiousness, which is reported to be synchronous or even precede the onset of detectable symptoms, the tracing and immediate testing of all who came in contact with the detected infected individual reduce the spread of epidemics, hospital load, and fatality rate. We also investigate how the strictness and promptness of the isolation of infected individuals affect the outcome of epidemics. We hope that these more precise node dynamics could be incorporated into complex large-scale epidemiological models to improve the accuracy and credibility of predictions.</description>

      <title>Community as a Vague Operator: Epistemological Questions for a Critical Heuristics of Community Detection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to analyse the nature and epistemic consequences of what figures in network science as patterns of nodes and edges called 'communities'. Tracing these patterns as multi-faceted and ambivalent, we propose to describe the concept of community as a 'vague operator', a variant of Susan Leigh Star's notion of the boundary object, and propose that the ability to construct different modes of description that are both vague in some registers and hyper-precise in others, is core both to digital politics and the analysis of 'communities'. Engaging with these formations in terms drawn from mathematics and software studies enables a wider mapping of their formation. Disentangling different lineages in network science then allows us to contextualise the founding account of 'community' popularised by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman in 2002. After studying one particular community detection algorithm, the widely-used 'Louvain algorithm', we comment on controversies arising with some of their more ambiguous applications. We argue that 'community' can act as a real abstraction with the power to reshape social relations such as producing echo chambers in social networking sites. To rework the epistemological terms of community detection and propose a reconsideration of vague operators, we draw on debates and propositions within the literature of network science to imagine a 'critical heuristics' that embraces partiality, epistemic humbleness, reflexivity and artificiality.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of diffusion-driven multi-type epidemic models with application to COVID-19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a flexible Bayesian evidence synthesis approach to model the age-specific transmission dynamics of COVID-19 based on daily mortality counts. The temporal evolution of transmission rates in populations containing multiple types of individuals is reconstructed via an appropriate dimension-reduction formulation driven by independent diffusion processes. A suitably tailored compartmental model is used to learn the latent counts of infection, accounting for fluctuations in transmission influenced by public health interventions and changes in human behaviour. The model is fitted to freely available COVID-19 data sources from the UK, Greece, and Austria and validated using a large-scale prevalence survey in England. In particular, we demonstrate how model expansion can facilitate evidence reconciliation at a latent level. The code implementing this work is made freely available via the Bernadette R package.</description>

      <title>Multi-Species Prey-Predator Dynamics During a Multi-Strain Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small and large scale pandemics are a natural phenomenon repeatably appearing throughout history, causing ecological and biological shifts in ecosystems and a wide range of their habitats. These pandemics usually start with a single strain but shortly become multi-strain due to a mutation process of the pathogen causing the epidemic. In this study, we propose a novel eco-epidemiological model that captures multi-species prey-predator dynamics with a multi-strain pandemic. The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator model and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem's sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations. Our results are aligned with known ecological and epidemiological findings, thus supporting the adequacy of the proposed model in realistically capturing the complex eco-epidemiological properties of the multi-species multi-strain pandemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature and noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</description>
