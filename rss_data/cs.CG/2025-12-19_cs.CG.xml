      <title>Edge-wise Topological Divergence Gaps: Guiding Search in Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a topological feedback mechanism for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) by analyzing the divergence between a tour and the minimum spanning tree (MST). Our key contribution is a canonical decomposition theorem that expresses the tour-MST gap as edge-wise topology-divergence gaps from the RTD-Lite barcode. Based on this, we develop a topological guidance for 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics that increases their performance. We carry out experiments with fine-optimization of tours obtained from heatmap-based methods, TSPLIB, and random instances. Experiments demonstrate the topology-guided optimization results in better performance and faster convergence in many cases.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Neural Surfaces for 3D Mesh Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art compression of a broad range of modalities such as images, videos, 3D surfaces, and audio. Most studies have focused on building neural counterparts of traditional implicit representations of 3D geometries, such as signed distance functions. However, the triangle mesh-based representation of geometry remains the most widely used representation in the industry, while building INRs capable of generating them has been sparsely studied. In this paper, we present a method for building compact INRs of zero-genus 3D manifolds. Our method relies on creating a spherical parameterization of a given 3D mesh - mapping the surface of a mesh to that of a unit sphere - then constructing an INR that encodes the displacement vector field defined continuously on its surface that regenerates the original shape. The compactness of our representation can be attributed to its hierarchical structure, wherein it first recovers the coarse structure of the encoded surface before adding high-frequency details to it. Once the INR is computed, 3D meshes of arbitrary resolution/connectivity can be decoded from it. The decoding can be performed in real time while achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between reconstruction quality and the size of the compressed representations.</description>

      <title>Locally Correct Interleavings between Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal sequences of terrains arise in various application areas. To analyze them efficiently, one generally needs a suitable abstraction of the data as well as a method to compare and match them over time. In this paper we consider merge trees as a topological descriptor for terrains and the interleaving distance as a method to match and compare them. An interleaving between two merge trees consists of two maps, one in each direction. These maps must satisfy ancestor relations and hence introduce a ''shift'' between points and their image. An optimal interleaving minimizes the maximum shift; the interleaving distance is the value of this shift. However, to study the evolution of merge trees over time, we need not only a number but also a meaningful matching between the two trees. The two maps of an optimal interleaving induce a matching, but due to the bottleneck nature of the interleaving distance, this matching fails to capture local similarities between the trees. In this paper we hence propose a notion of local optimality for interleavings. To do so, we define the residual interleaving distance, a generalization of the interleaving distance that allows additional constraints on the maps. This allows us to define locally correct interleavings, which use a range of shifts across the two merge trees that reflect the local similarity well. We give a constructive proof that a locally correct interleaving always exists.</description>

      <title>Online Competitive Searching for Rays in the Half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for rays (or lines) in the half-plane. The given problem turns out to be a very natural extension of the cow-path problem that is lifted into the half-plane and the problem can also directly be motivated by a 1.5-dimensional terrain search problem. We present and analyse an efficient strategy for our setting and guarantee a competitive ratio of less than 9.12725 in the worst case and also prove a lower bound of at least 9.06357 for any strategy. Thus the given strategy is almost optimal, the gap is less than 0.06368. By appropriate adjustments for the terrain search problem we can improve on former results and present geometrically motivated proof arguments. As expected, the terrain itself can only be helpful for the searcher that competes against the unknown shortest path. We somehow extract the core of the problem.</description>

      <title>Do Multi-Agents Solve Better Than Single? Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

      <title>Element-Saving Hexahedral 3-Refinement Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conforming hexahedral (hex) meshes are favored in simulation for their superior numerical properties, yet automatically decomposing a general 3D volume into a conforming hex mesh remains a formidable challenge. Among existing approaches, methods that construct an adaptive Cartesian grid and subsequently convert it into a conforming mesh stand out for their robustness. However, the topological schemes enabling this conversion require strict compatibility conditions among grid elements, which inevitably refine the initial grid and increase element count. Developing more relaxed conditions to minimize this overhead has been a persistent research focus. State-of-the-art 2-refinement octree methods employ a weakly-balanced condition combined with a generalized pairing condition, using a dual transformation to yield exceptionally low element counts. Yet this approach suffers from critical limitations: information stored on primal cells, such as signed distance fields or triangle index sets, is lost after dualization, and the resulting dual cells often exhibit poor minimum scaled Jacobian (min SJ) with non-planar quadrilateral (quad) faces. Alternatively, 3-refinement 27-tree methods can directly generate conforming hex meshes through template-based replacement of primal cells, producing higher-quality elements with planar quad faces. However, previous 3-refinement techniques impose conditions far more strict than 2-refinement counterparts, severely over-refining grids by factors of ten to one hundred, creating a major bottleneck in simulation pipelines. This article introduces a novel 3-refinement approach that transforms an adaptive 3-refinement grid into a conforming grid using a moderately-balanced condition, slightly stronger than the weakly-balanced condition but substantially more relaxed than prior 3-refinement requirements......
