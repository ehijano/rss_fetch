      <title>How different are deterministic physics suites when coupled to fixed model dynamics and why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often difficult to attribute uncertainty and errors in atmospheric models to designated model components. This is because sub-grid parameterised processes interact strongly with the large-scale transport represented by the explicit model dynamics. We carry out experiments with prescribed large-scale dynamics and different sub-grid physics suites. This dataset has been constructed for the Model Uncertainty Model Intercomparison Project (MUMIP), in which each suite forecasts sub-grid tendencies at a 22km grid. The common dynamics is derived from a convection-permitting benchmark: an ICON DYAMOND experiment (2.5km grid).
  We compare four different physics suites for atmospheric models in an Indian Ocean experiment. We analyse their joint PDFs of precipitation and associated physics tendencies for a full month. Precipitation is selected because it is a dominant uncertainty in the models that redistributes large amounts of heat. We find that all physics suites produce very similar precipitation amounts, with very high correlations between models, which exceed 0.95 at the native grid. However, the convection-permitting benchmark is more dissimilar from each of the physics suites, with correlations of $\approx$0.80.
  Similarly, we show that the vertically averaged physics tendencies in the free-troposphere are highly similar between the four physics suites, yet different if reconstructed for the benchmark. The water vapour sink is very closely linked with precipitation in the four physics suites. This suggests that the coarse-grid models are overconfident.
  We hypothese is that variation in unresolved convective structures can lead to variation in the dynamics, following a given amount of latent heating at fine grids, but not in our physics suites.

      <title>Tidal motions in the deep Mediterranean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mediterranean Sea is known for its limited tidal motions. For example, surface barotropic tidal elevations have an amplitude of 0.1 m in the Northwestern Mediterranean. Nevertheless, these small tides are noticeable in temperature records at the 2500-m deep seafloor, but only under near-homogeneous conditions when buoyancy frequency N &lt; f, the inertial frequency. After transfer of pressure to temperature units via the local adiabatic lapse rate, the observed internal-wave temperature signals may thus be corrected for 1.5x10-5-degrC amplitude semidiurnal barotropic tides. The remaining baroclinic tides are embedded in the broad and featureless inertio-gravity wave band, with some energy enhancement near its boundaries, also under tenfold-larger energetic stratified water conditions.</description>

      <title>Turbulence demonstrates height variations in closely spaced deep-sea mooring lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It may be important to precisely know heights of moored oceanographic instrumentation. For example, moorings can be closely spaced or accidentally be located on small rocks or in small gullies. Height variations O(1 m) will yield registration of different values when conditions such as small-scale density stratification vary strongly. Such little height variations may prove difficult to measure in the deep sea, requiring high-accuracy pressure sensors preferably on all instruments in a mooring-array. In this paper, an alternative method for relative height determination is presented using high-resolution temperature sensors moored on multiple densely-spaced lines in the deep Western Mediterranean. While it was anticipated that height variations between lines could be detected under near-homogeneous conditions via adiabatic lapse rate O(0.0001degrC m-1) by the 0.00003degrC-noise-level sensors, such was prevented by the impossibility of properly correcting for short-term bias due to electronic drift. Instead, a satisfactory height determination was found during a period of relatively strong stratification and large turbulence activity. By band-pass filtering data of the highest-resolved turbulent motions across the strongest temperature gradient, significant height variations were detectable to within +/-0.2 m.</description>

      <title>Stratified-turbulence observations in the deep Mediterranean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nearly half-cubic hectometer of deep Mediterranean-Sea waters is yearlong sampled with about 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors to study different sources of turbulent waterflows, which are vital for life. Although temperature differences are never larger than 0.01degrC, daily, weekly, and seasonal variations are observed. About half the time, relatively warm stratified waters are moved from 100's of meters higher levels to near the seafloor. These internal-wave and sub-mesoscale eddy-induced motions are half an order of magnitude more turbulent than those induced via general geothermal heating from below, and about one order of magnitude more turbulent than those from open-ocean processes. A rough estimate shows that eddy-induced stratified turbulence is likely more important for deep-sea life than rare, not observed, deep dense-water formation at the abyssal-plain mooring site. With a delay of about a week, the stratified turbulence tracks atmospheric disturbances, which are found 35% more energetic in winter than in summer. From comparison of turbulence-calculation methods, of band-pass filtering with vertical-displacement reordering, for data over one-four days, a generalization is proposed for the filter cut-offs under weakly stratified and near-homogeneous conditions in the deep Mediterranean.</description>

      <title>Effects of Horizontal Discretization on Triangular and Hexagonal Grids on Linear Baroclinic and Symmetric Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global ocean general circulation models are run at eddy-permitting resolutions, reproducing accurate growth rates of baroclinic instabilities is a major concern when choosing a discretization of the equations of motion. From this viewpoint, we analyze discretizations on triangular and hexagonal grids with different types of variable staggering used in several ocean circulation models. By extending the linear baroclinic instability analysis in the Eady configuration to discretizations on more complex grids, several numerical subtleties are revealed. In comparison to discretizations on quadrilateral grids, the analyzed discretizations are less robust against unstable spurious modes, partly created by the mesh geometry. Some of the subtleties arise because spurious modes on staggered triangular and hexagonal grids do not adhere to Galilean invariance. As a consequence, their growth rates demonstrate a dependence on the alignment between the background flow and the grid, as well as the strength of a uniform background flow. The interactions with spurious modes become more significant on the axis of symmetric instabilities where the physical and spurious branches of instability are more difficult to separate in wavenumber space. Our analysis shows that in most cases moderate biharmonic viscosity and diffusion suppress spurious branches. However, one needs to carefully calibrate the viscosity and diffusivity parameters for each of the considered discretizations in order to achieve this.</description>

      <title>CNN-based Surface Temperature Forecasts with Ensemble Numerical Weather Prediction over Medium-range Forecast Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is proposed. This method enables surface temperature forecasting with lead times beyond the short-range, extending up to five days. Due to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method applies CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) to an ensemble NWP system. First, the post-processing is applied to each ensemble member to reduce systematic errors and reconstruct high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. This approach reduces the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs and outperforms operational post-processing. Second, the CNN is applied to all ensemble members to construct a new ensemble forecasting system, in which deterministic forecast accuracy, probabilistic reliability, and representation of ensemble spread are improved compared with those of the original system. We demonstrate that this CNN-based post-processing is fundamentally different from the artificial error reduction caused by smoothing inherent in ensemble averaging because the post-processing reduces forecast errors without degrading the forecast information. These results indicate that the proposed method provides a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts and is particularly valuable for use in operational centers with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Statistics of near-inertial waves over a background flow via quantum and statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW) field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the `quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by Danioux, Vanneste and B\"uhler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).</description>
