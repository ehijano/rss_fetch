      <title>On the depth of tensor products over Cohen-Macaulay rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by classical work on the depth formula for tensor products of finitely generated $R$-modules, we introduce two conditions which we call $(\mathbf{ldep})$ and $(\mathbf{rdep})$ and their derived variations. We show for Cohen-Macaulay local rings that derived $(\mathbf{ldep})$ is equivalent to $\dim(R)$ being a uniform Auslander bound for $R$, and if $\dim(R)&gt;0$ that both are equivalent to $(\mathbf{ldep})$. We introduce an analogous condition we call the \emph{uniform Buchweitz condition} and provide a corresponding theorem for the $(\mathbf{rdep})$ condition. As a consequence of these results, we show $(\mathbf{ldep})$ implies $(\mathbf{rdep})$ when $R$ is Gorenstein and that the $(\mathbf{ldep})$ and $(\mathbf{rdep})$ conditions behave well under modding out by regular sequences and completion, but we give a concrete example showing they need not localize. Using our methods, we extend work of Jorgensen by calculating the value $q_R(M,N):=\sup\{i \mid \operatorname{Tor}^R_i(M,N) \ne 0\}$ under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>$(S_2)$-ifications, semi-Nagata rings, and the lifting problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a two-part article. In the first part, we study an alternative notion to Nagata rings. A Nagata ring is a Noetherian ring $R$ such that every finite $R$-algebra that is an integral domain has finite normalization. We replace the normalization by an $(S_2)$-ification, study new phenomena, and prove parallel results. In particular, we show a Nagata domain has a finite $(S_2)$-ification. In the second part, we study the local lifting problem. We show that for a semilocal Noetherian ring $R$ that is $I$-adically complete for an ideal $I$, if $R/I$ has $(S_k)$ (resp. Cohen--Macaulay, Gorenstein, lci) formal fibers, so does $R$. As a consequence, we show if $R/I$ is a quotient of a Cohen--Macaulay ring, so is $R$.</description>

      <title>Key exchange protocol based on circulant matrix action over congruence-simple semiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new key exchange protocol based on circulant matrices acting on matrices over a congruence-simple semiring. We describe how to compute matrices with the necessary properties for the implementation of the protocol. Additionally, we provide an analysis of its computational cost and its security against known attacks.</description>

      <title>Torsion classes of extended Dynkin quivers over commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02928v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Noetherian $R$-algebra $\Lambda$, there is a canonical inclusion $\mathsf{tors}\Lambda\to\prod_{\mathfrak{p}\in \mathrm{Spec} R}\mathsf{tors}(\kappa(\mathfrak{p})\Lambda)$, and each element in the image satisfies a certain compatibility condition. We call $\Lambda$ compatible if the image coincides with the set of all compatible elements. For example, for a Dynkin quiver $Q$ and a commutative Noetherian ring $R$ containing a field, the path algebra $RQ$ is compatible. In this paper, we prove that $RQ$ is compatible when $Q$ is an extended Dynkin quiver and $R$ is either a Dedekind domain or a Noetherian semilocal normal ring of dimension two.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group Gal$(E/F)$. If Tr${}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. Suppose that $E$ has characteristic $p$. We prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. As an application, we find closed-form expressions for the roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials $t^p-t-y$. Let $y$ lie in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$. The Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y\in F_{p^n}[t]$ is reducible precisely when $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y^{p^i}=0$. In this case, $t^p-t-y=\prod_{k=0}^{p-1}(t-x-k)$ where $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in F_{p^e}$ and $e=n_p$. The sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$, and if $e$ is small, then we give explicit $z$.</description>

      <title>New kinds of block diagonal matching fields and toric degenerations of Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block diagonal matching field has many previous works. In general, a coherent matching field induces a monomial order to Pl\"{u}cker algebra, and block diagonal matching fields are a kind of coherent matching fields. In the present paper, we introduce a new kind of block diagonal matching fields and study the problem when they give a SAGBI basis. As a corollary, we provide a new family of toric degenerations of Grassmannians by using SAGBI bases.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for a certain family of polynomials over rationals and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers of normal edge rings (\bf{I})</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach named the {\it induced-subgraph approach} for investigating the Betti numbers of normal edge rings. Utilizing this approach, we compute all the multi-graded Betti numbers of the edge rings associated with two-ear graphs (Definition 4.1) and compact graphs (Definition 5.1). In particular, we show that for two-ear graphs and compact graphs of type 1 or 2, their multi-graded Betti numbers are always equal to the top multi-graded Betti numbers of some of their induced subgraphs. In contrast, some of the multi-graded Betti numbers of compact graphs of type 3 are not the top multi-graded Betti numbers of any of their induced subgraph. We speculate that our approach can be applicable to many other normal edge rings.</description>

      <title>Advertising finite commutative semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every mathematician is familiar with the beautiful structure of finite commutative groups. What is less well known is that finite commutative semigroups also have a neat and well-described structure. We prove this in an efficient fashion. We unravel the structural details of many concrete finite commutative semigroups. Here "concrete" comes in two types. First, we examine the structure of the MULTIPLICATIVE semigroups Z/nZ (more interesting than their bland additive siblings) and show that it depends on the prime factors of $n$ in interesting ways. Second, we thoroughly treat finite commutative semigroups defined by generators and relations. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the area, including some novel results and some enticing directions for the expert to follow.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algebras are subquotients of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Cluster Algebras (GCA) are generalizations of Cluster Algebras (CA) with higher-order exchange relations. Previously, Chekhov-Shapiro conjectured that every GCA can be embedded into a CA. In this paper, we prove a modified version of this conjecture by providing a construction that realizes a given GCA as subquotient of some CA, as an algebra over the ground ring of the GCA via restriction of scalars.</description>
