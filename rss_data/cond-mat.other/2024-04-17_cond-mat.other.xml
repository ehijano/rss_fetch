      <title>Energy Transfer Mechanism Under Incoherent Light Excitation in noisy Environments: Memory Effects in Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the energy gap and coupling constants in and between chromophores can play important role in the absorption and energy transfer across a collection of two level systems. In a noisy environment, fluctuations can control efficiency of energy transfer through several factors, including quantum coherence. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of light-induced stationary quantum coherence on the efficiency of transferring optical excitation to a designated "trap" state, crucial for subsequent reactions such as those in photosynthesis. However, these studies have typically employed either a Markovian, or a perturbative approximation for the environment induced fluctuations. In this study, we depart from these approaches to incorporate memory effects by using Kubo's quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE). We introduce the effects of the decay of excitation (to the ground state) and the desired trapping that provides the direction of the motion of the excitation. In the presence of light-induced pumping, we establish a relation between the mean survival time, efficiency, and the correlation decay time of the bath-induced fluctuations. We find a decrease in the steady state coherence during the transition from the non-Markovian regime (characterized by small values of fluctuation strength V and inverse of bath correlation time b) to the Markovian limit (where V and b are both large), resulting in a decrease in efficiency. We recover a connection between transfer flux and the imaginary part of coherences in both equilibrium and excited bath states, in both correlated and We uncover a non-monotonic dependence of efficiency on site energy heterogeneity for both correlated and uncorrelated bath models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties within DPOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse\textcolor{red}{.} The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>
