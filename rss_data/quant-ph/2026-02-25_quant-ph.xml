      <title>QSolver: A Quantum Constraint Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing interest in quantum programs, ensuring their correctness is a fundamental challenge. Although constraint-solving techniques can overcome some limitations of traditional testing and verification, they have not yet been sufficiently explored in the context of quantum programs. To address this gap, we present QSolver, the first quantum constraint solver. QSolver provides a structured framework for handling five types of quantum constraints and incorporates an automated assertion generation module to verify quantum states. QSolver transforms quantum programs and multi-moment constraints into symbolic representations, and utilizes an SMT solver to obtain quantum states that satisfy these constraints. To validate the correctness of the generated input states, QSolver automatically generates assertion programs corresponding to each constraint. Experimental results show that QSolver efficiently processes commonly used quantum gates and demonstrates good scalability across quantum programs of different sizes.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Proof of the Quantum Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symplectic linear-algebraic proof of the Quantum Singleton Bound for stabiliser quantum error-correcting codes together with a Lean4 formalisation of the linear-algebraic argument. The proof is formulated in the language of finite-dimensional symplectic vector spaces modelling Pauli operators and relies on distance-based erasure correctability and the cleaning lemma. Using a dimension-counting argument within the symplectic stabiliser framework, we derive the bound \( k + 2(d - 1) \le n \) for any [[n, k, d]] stabiliser code. This approach isolates the algebraic structure underlying the bound and avoids the heavier analytic machinery that appears in entropy-based proofs, while remaining well-suited to formal verification.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations for Extreme Ultraviolet Photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the state-of-the-art process in semiconductor fabrication, yet its spatial resolution is fundamentally limited by the ``blur'' originating from absorption of photons at 92 eV, which induce physical and chemical changes in the photoresist via excited state processes and electron cascades. Accurate modeling of these phenomena requires precise ab initio data for high-energy decay channels, specifically photoabsorption and photoelectron emission. These are computationally difficult for classical methods due to prohibitive scaling in simulating electron dynamics, or due to the inability to resolve the ionization continuum in an efficient manner. In this work, we present quantum simulation algorithms to compute these key observables. First, we introduce a coherent time-domain spectroscopy algorithm optimized to resolve the photoabsorption cross-section at the 92 eV operating frequency. Second, we develop a first-quantized plane-wave simulation to compute the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum, utilizing real-time dynamics and energy windowing to treat bound and delocalized scattering states on equal footing. Additionally, we provide logical resource estimation for a model photoresist monomer, 4-iodo-2-methylphenol (IMePh), and demonstrate that 92 eV absorption sensitivity can be resolved using roughly $200$ logical qubits and $10^{9}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit with approximately $10^3$ shots for the smallest instance. The more sophisticated photoemission algorithm that models the continuum explicitly, incurs gate costs of $\geq 10^{13}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit, $10^4$ shots, and requires a few thousand logical qubits. These results establish high-fidelity quantum simulations as a key component to parameterize the multi-scale macroscopic models required to overcome the electron blur bottleneck in semiconductor miniaturization.</description>

      <title>Proof of a finite threshold for the union-find decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast decoders that achieve strong error suppression are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) from both practical and theoretical perspectives. The union-find (UF) decoder for the surface code is widely regarded as a promising candidate, offering almost-linear time complexity and favorable empirical error suppression supported by numerical evidence. However, the lack of a rigorous threshold theorem has left open whether the UF decoder can achieve fault tolerance beyond the error models and parameter regimes tested in numerical simulations. Here, we provide a rigorous proof of a finite threshold for the UF decoder on the surface code under the circuit-level local stochastic error model. To this end, we develop a refined error-clustering framework that extends techniques previously used to analyze cellular-automaton and renormalization-group decoders, by showing that error clusters can be separated by substantially larger buffers, thereby enabling analytical control over the behavior of the UF decoder. Using this guarantee, we further prove a quasi-polylogarithmic upper bound on the average runtime of a parallel UF decoder in terms of the code size. We also show that this framework yields a finite threshold for the greedy decoder, a simpler decoder with lower complexity but weaker empirical error suppression. These results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the practical use of UF-based decoders in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, while offering a unified framework for studying fault tolerance across these practical decoders.</description>

      <title>Time Crystals as Passively Protected Oscillating Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting information against decoherence in open quantum systems remains a central challenge for quantum computing. In particular, passive error correction schemes have so far been limited to static memories rather than dynamical qubits. We demonstrate that a driven-dissipative bosonic system can encode a persistently oscillating qubit within a noiseless subsystem, realized explicitly in the Bose-Hubbard dimer (BHD). The strong parity symmetry of the model leads to degenerate stationary states. This symmetry is further broken into non-stationary states in the thermodynamic limit, which exhibit persistent oscillations. As the driving force increases, the Liouvillian spectrum of these states features a phase transition. Above the transition point, the non-stationary state encodes quantum information, preserving it in a noiseless subsystem. In addition to global loss that affects both bosonic modes identically, we further add global dephasing and show that the oscillating qubit is preserved. Finally, in order to gain additional physical insight, we study the effect of phase perturbation to both modes and observe that likewise they are passively protected, returning approximately to their initial configurations. These results establish dissipative time-crystalline dynamics as a mechanism for passive protection of dynamical quantum information, enabling autonomously stabilized oscillating qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for simulating resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in battery materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20270v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is the workhorse experimental technique for probing the structural degradation of higher-capacity cathode materials. However, the interpretation of experimental spectra is challenging due to the lack of accurate simulations. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for simulating the RIXS spectrum of molecular clusters hypothesized to form in Li-excess cathodes. The algorithm uses quantum phase estimation to sample the spectrum from a state encoding the scattering transition amplitudes of the cluster valence excitations. We prepare this state in the quantum computer using a block-encoding of the dipole operator and quantum signal processing to implement the Green's function propagator over intermediate core-excited states. To showcase the algorithm, we use a model cluster proposed in recent experimental works consisting of an oxygen dimer bonded to a manganese atom. Using the PennyLane software platform, we report resource estimation for simulating RIXS spectra for chemically motivated active spaces of increasing sizes. For a classically challenging active space with 20 orbitals, the algorithm requires $2.0 \times 10^{10}$ Toffoli gates and $414$ logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Pulse-level control for quantum resource preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing the time required for quantum state preparation is crucial to mitigate decoherence and enable practical quantum algorithms on near-term hardware. In this work, we introduce a technique for quantum state preparation in transmon-qubit systems using optimized electromagnetic pulse sequences rather than discrete quantum gates. By directly targeting quantum correlations instead of specific target states, we identify minimal-time pulse protocols that optimize relevant entanglement resources, such as concurrence and the three-tangle for two and three qubit systems, respectively. For the figures of merit considered, this approach successfully achieves maximal entanglement in each case: Bell, GHZ and W like states. Beyond state preparation, the resource-oriented nature of the approach leads to a reduced effective expressivity of the control scheme, a feature that represents an advantage in algorithmic settings where excessive control freedom is known to hinder performance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Barriers from Computational Complexity: Matrix-Product-State Approach to Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Effective Heterodyne Detection Efficiency with SI-Traceable Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of coherent optical receivers is essential for reliable performance assessment in coherent communications, precision and quantum sensing, and continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where the effective detection efficiency directly impacts channel parameter estimation. We present a methodology traceable to the International System of Units (SI) to determine the effective heterodyne detection efficiency of balanced receivers using shot-noise-referenced measurements. The protocol relies on two observables acquired with an electrical spectrum analyzer: the heterodyne beat-note power and the local oscillator shot-noise variance, with explicit treatment of the analyzer's equivalent noise bandwidth (ENBW). The photon flux in the signal path is referenced to SI units via calibrated radiometric standards. We first validate the protocol on a free-space receiver, demonstrating consistency with an independently constructed optical loss chain across a wide range of signal powers and under controlled, calibrated attenuation. Extending the same estimator to a fiber-coupled, polarization-maintaining balanced receiver confirms that the protocol is robust for practical coherent-receiver architectures and intermediate frequencies in the MHz range. These results establish a traceable, uncertainty-bounded framework for real-time receiver calibration, providing a practical route for CV-QKD and other coherent optical systems.</description>

      <title>No change in Hilbert space fundamentalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space fundamentalism (HSF) states that everything about the physical world is encoded in the Hamiltonian operator and the state vector (as a unit vector, not a wavefunction, which requires additional specification of a configuration space, a position basis, or the position observables). That all structures needed to describe reality, including subsystems, space, fields, emerge from these.
  I show that HSF can't account for our observations that the physical world changes in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is rapidly transitioning from theoretical promise to practical relevance across data-intensive scientific domains. In this Review, we provide a structured overview of recent advances that bridge foundational quantum learning principles with real-world applications. We survey foundational QML paradigms, including variational quantum algorithms, quantum kernel methods, and neural-network quantum states, with emphasis on their applicability to complex quantum systems. We examine neural-network quantum states as expressive variational models for correlated matter, non-equilibrium dynamics, and open quantum systems, and discuss fundamental challenges associated with training and sampling. Recent advances in quantum-enhanced sampling and diagnostics of learning dynamics, including information-theoretic tools, are reviewed as mechanisms for improving scalability and trainability. The Review further highlights application-driven QML frameworks in drug discovery, cancer biology, and agro-climate modeling, where data complexity and constraints motivate hybrid quantum-classical approaches. We conclude with a discussion of federated quantum machine learning as a route to distributed, privacy-preserving quantum intelligence. Overall, this Review presents a unified perspective on the opportunities and limitations of QML for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Guided State Refinement for Shallow Feedback-Based Quantum Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited circuit depth remains a central constraint for quantum optimization in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime, where shallow unitary dynamics may fail to sufficiently concentrate probability on low-energy configurations. We introduce Measurement-Guided Initialization (MGI), an iterative strategy that uses measurement outcomes from previous executions to update the initialization of subsequent runs. The method extracts single-qubit marginal probabilities from dominant measurement outcomes and prepares a biased product-state initialization, allowing information obtained during optimization to be reused without introducing classical parameter optimization. We implement this approach in the context of the Feedback-Based Algorithm for Quantum Optimization (FALQON) and evaluate its performance on weighted MaxCut instances. Numerical results show that measurement-guided initialization improves the performance of shallow-depth circuits and enables iterative refinement toward high-quality solutions while preserving the non-variational structure of the algorithm. These results indicate that measurement statistics can be exploited to improve shallow quantum optimization protocols compatible with NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>A quantum mechanical analysis of the coherence de Broglie wavelength for superresolution and enhanced sensitivity in a coupled interferometer scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing has drawn considerable attention as a means to overcome the fundamental limitations in classical sensing. In practice, however, quantum sensing has been strongly constrained by the photon loss, the achievable photon number N in N00N states, and by a finite squeezing level in squeezed states. These limitations are particularly critical to photon-loss-sensitive applications such as LiDAR as well as to general sensing platforms that require large effective N, such as ring-laser gyroscopes. Recently, fundamentally different sensing platforms have been reported to overcome both classical and quantum constraints in a practical regime. One such approach exploits the coherence de Broglie wavelength (CBW) realized in an anti-symmetrically coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) architecture. Here, a pure quantum mechanical analysis of the CBW is presented for a loss-free sensing mechanism of superresolution with enhanced sensitivity. A proof-of-principle demonstration of CBW is also presented.</description>

      <title>A Unified Error Correction Code for Universal Quantum Computing with Identical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on identical particle qubits (IPQs), where we find that the first-order IPQ - bath interaction fundamentally differs from the conventional first-order qubit-bath interaction. This key distinction necessitates a redesign of existing strategies to fight decoherence. We propose that the simplest quantum error correction code can be realized directly within the physical qubit, provided that conventional correction and restoration are generalized beyond unitary operations to employ physically implementable reversal operations -- naturally placing logical and physical qubits on equal footing. We further demonstrate that dynamical decoupling (DD) remains effective within this unified framework, and that a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) -- like structure emerges. Unlike previous approximate treatments, our analytically solvable IPQ-Bath model enables rigorous testing of these strategies, with numerical simulations validating their effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) sits at the intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, offering the prospect of new computational paradigms and advantages for processing complex data. This chapter introduces the fundamentals of QML for readers from both communities, establishing a shared conceptual foundation. We connect the worst-case, adversarial perspective from theoretical computer science with the physical principles of quantum systems, highlighting how superposition, entanglement, and measurement collapse influence learning and robustness. Special attention is given to adversarial robustness, understood as the ability of QML models to resist inputs designed to cause failure. We motivate the study of QML in adversarial settings, outlining distinctions between classical and quantum data and computations when the adversary is a core element. This chapter serves as a starting point to adversarial and robust quantum machine learning in subsequent chapters.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Black Hole Analog: Unidirectional Transport without Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes permit matter to cross their event horizon in only one direction. We show that interacting bosons in optical lattices with asymmetric barrier exhibit an analogous phenomenon, creating unidirectional quantum transport without external driving or dissipation. This directionality emerges purely from many-body interactions, which cause asymmetric projection of the initial state onto transport-enabled or transport-forbidden sectors. The resulting dynamics create an effective one-way boundary in Hilbert space, forming a quantum analog of a black-hole event horizon. Our results establish interactions as a fundamentally new route to directional transport, enabling coherent rectification in atomtronic circuits by the use of intrinsic properties of the system only.</description>

      <title>Aging of coupled qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aging transition refers to the shift from an oscillatory state to a globally ceased state due to some forms of deterioration in classical physics. Similar behavior has also been observed in quantum oscillators. Although it has received extensive attention in coupled oscillator systems, it has not yet been studied in coupled qubits. In this manuscript, we explore the aging transition in a network of coupled qubits. Our model describes {numerous} qubits driven by a laser, with both dissipative and coherent qubit-qubit couplings. The ratio of inactive qubits to total qubits and the population in the excited state of the qubits are employed to characterize the aging transition. We find a transition where the population in the excited states suddenly drops when the ratio exceeds a threshold. This behavior is intriguing and contrasts with coupled oscillators, where no sudden drop is observed. Additionally, we demonstrate how the couplings and driving laser influence the threshold. The underlying physics of the sudden drop is elucidated. The region where the aging transition occurs is determined based on stability analysis theory.</description>

      <title>Distilling Magic States in the Bicycle Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic State Distillation is considered to be one of the promising methods for supplying the non-Clifford resources required to achieve universal fault tolerance. Conventional MSD protocols implemented in surface codes often require multiple code blocks and lattice surgery rounds, resulting in substantial qubit overhead, especially at low target error rates.
  In this work, we present practical magic state distillation factories on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes that execute Pauli-measurement-based Clifford circuits inside a single BB code block. We formulate distillation circuit design as a joint optimization of logical qubit mapping, gate scheduling, measurement nativization, and protocol compression via qubit recycling. Based on detailed resource analysis and simulations, our BB factories have space-time volume comparable to that of leading distillation factories while delivering lower target error at a smaller qubit footprint, and are particularly compelling as second-round distillers following magic state cultivations.</description>

Abstract: In 2013, Clader, Jacobs, and Sprouse developed a quantum computing algorithm that solves electromagnetic scattering problems exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm for that problem. We examine this quantum algorithm's potential practical feasibility for modeling a target's radar cross section. Doing so could be important for modeling and predicting radar behavior against emerging targets.</description>

      <title>Effect of atom-oscillator interaction on the aging transition in coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillators are often employed as a model of radiation fields, which may couple to an atom and play an important role for creating and manipulating nonclassical states in quantum metrology, quantum simulation, and quantum information. Aging transitions in coupled oscillators have been studied extensively in both the classical and quantum contexts. It is well known that the onset of aging transitions can be modulated by the dissipative coupling between oscillators. In this study, we propose an alternative way to modulate the aging transition through coherent couplings between a two-level atom and the oscillators. Our findings reveal that, compared to atom-free systems in both classical and quantum regimes, the atom-oscillator coherent interaction reduces the inactive-to-total oscillator ratio required for aging transitions. Analytical results of the transition for both the classical oscillators and quantum oscillators suggest that the decay rate of the atom and the atom-oscillator coupling strength jointly change the aging transition point. The physics behind the observation is also elucidated in this article. Our research introduces a readily implementable strategy for manipulating aging transitions in more intricate systems, thereby advancing the control and understanding of these critical transitions in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit design from a retraction-based Riemannian optimization framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for ground state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, standard Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are often constrained by limited ansatz expressivity and difficult optimization landscapes. To address these issues, we adopt a geometric perspective, formulating the problem as the minimization of an energy cost function directly over the unitary group. We establish a retraction-based Riemannian optimization framework for this setting, ensuring that all algorithmic procedures are implementable on quantum hardware. Within this framework, we unify existing randomized gradient approaches under a Riemannian Random Subspace Gradient Projection (RRSGP) method. While recent geometric approaches have predominantly focused on such first-order gradient descent techniques, efficient second-order methods remain unexplored. To bridge this gap, we derive explicit expressions for the Riemannian Hessian and show that it can be estimated directly on quantum hardware via parameter-shift rules. Building on this, we propose the Riemannian Random Subspace Newton (RRSN) method, a scalable second-order algorithm that constructs a Newton system from measurement data. Numerical simulations indicate that RRSN achieves quadratic convergence, yielding high-precision ground states in significantly fewer iterations compared to both existing first-order approaches and standard VQA baselines. Ultimately, this work provides a systematic foundation for applying a broader class of efficient Riemannian algorithms to quantum circuit design.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford symmetry protected topological higher-order cluster states in multi-qubit measurement-based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cluster state is a strongly entangled state, which is a source of measurement-based quantum computation. It is generated by applying controlled-Z (CZ) gates to the state $\left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $. It is protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{ \text{odd}}$ symmetry. By applying general quantum gates to the state $ \left\vert ++\cdots +\right\rangle $, we systematically obtain a general short-range entangled cluster state. If we use a non-Clifford gate such as the controlled phase-shift gate, we obtain a non-Clifford cluster state. Furthermore, if we use the controlled-controlled Z (CCZ) gate instead of the CZ gate, we obtain non-Clifford cluster states with five-body entanglement. We generalize it to the C$^{N}$Z gate, where $(2N+1)$-body entangled states are generated. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry is non-Clifford for $N\geq 3$. We demonstrate that there emerge $2^{2N}$ fold degenerate ground states for an open chain, indicating the emergence of $N$ free spins at each edge. They can be used as an $N$-qubit input and an $N$-qubit output in measurement-based quantum computation. We also study the non-invertible symmetry, the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the string-order parameter in addition to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{even}}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\text{odd}}$ symmetry in these models.</description>

      <title>First- and Second-Order Digital Quantum Simulation of Three-Level Jaynes-Cummings Dynamics on Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a digital quantum simulation of a three-level atomic system interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field based on the Jaynes-Cummings model, implemented on IBM Quantum superconducting processors. A qutrit is encoded using two physical qubits to represent the atomic states, while an additional qubit encodes the truncated field mode, enabling the realization of effective $\Lambda$-type atomic dynamics.The continuous-time light-matter interaction is implemented in a digital form by discretizing the evolution using Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. In contrast to an analog realization, the digital simulation replaces the continuous evolution with a sequence of quantum gates whose parameters are explicitly controlled. Phase evolution arising from the interaction Hamiltonian is digitally encoded using calibrated $R_Z$ gates, whose rotation angles are fixed by the physically relevant coupling scale and the chosen Trotter time step.State preparation is achieved using Hadamard and parametrized rotation gates, while the interaction dynamics are implemented through controlled operations. A comparative analysis between first- and second-order Trotter implementations reveals a trade-off between digital accuracy and hardware-induced noise. Overall, the results demonstrate that calibrated gate operations and noise-aware circuit design enable reliable digital simulation of multi-level light-matter interactions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Qudit stabiliser codes for $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the connection between Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs) by showing that a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory with prime dimension $N$ coupled to dynamical matter can be expressed as a qudit stabilizer code. Using the stabilizer formalism we show how to formulate an exact mapping of the encoded $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory onto two different bosonic models, uncovering a logical duality generated by error correction itself. From this perspective, quantum error correction provides a unifying language to expose dual descriptions of lattice gauge theories. In addition, we generalize earlier $\mathbb{Z}_2$ constructions on qubits to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ on $N$-level qudits and demonstrate how universal fault-tolerant gates can be implemented via state injection between compatible qudit codes.</description>

      <title>Task Concurrency and Compatibility in Measurement-Based Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Networks (MBQNs) rely on multipartite pre-shared entanglement resources to satisfy entanglement requests. Traditional designs optimize these resources for individual tasks, neglecting that multiple tasks may arrive concurrently and compete for the same entanglement. We introduce compatibility as a design-level metric, capturing whether concurrent tasks can be satisfied by the same entanglement resources. We define a worst-case notion of compatibility where nodes are prevented from coordinating after task arrival and illustrate why tasks may be incompatible. Furthermore, we explore compatibility extensions that account for stochastic arrivals and the capability to supplement the pre-shared entanglement with additional entanglement on-demand, and show that incompatibility differs structurally dependent on the set of concurrent tasks. We argue that compatibility should be used for resource state design, building the foundation for determining which task pairs the network should support with pre-shared entanglement and which require execution-time coordination. Numerical simulations demonstrate this potential, with $(G,1)$-compatibility achieving a 40%-55% gain in simultaneously supported tasks relative to the single-task baseline. By incorporating compatibility as a fundamental design objective, quantum networks can move beyond single-task optimization towards scalable, robust architectures that effectively balance proactive entanglement distribution and supplemental reactive coordination.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning for the Two-Dimensional Quantum Rotor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of diverse generative deep learning models and their variants has furnished substantial insights for investigating quantum many-body problems. In this work, we design two models based on the foundational architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to investigate the ground-state properties and phase transition characteristics of the two-dimensional quantum rotor model (QRM). Within a semi-supervised learning framework, we incorporate multiple layers of transposed convolutions in the generator, enabling the conditional GAN to more efficiently extract low-dimensional encoded information. Analysis of one-dimensional latent variables associated with ground-state samples for different system sizes allows us to pinpoint the location of the critical point. In addition, we introduce dynamically adaptive weighting factors related to the distributional characteristics into the loss function of the deep convolutional GAN, and utilize upsampling techniques to enlarge the generated sample sizes. Comparisons of the optimization processes for mean magnetization and potential energy density across different magnetization regimes of QRM demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate valid ground-state samples, significantly reducing computational time. Our results highlight the promising potential of generative deep learning in quantum phase transition research, especially in critical point identification and the auxiliary generation of simulation data for quantum many-body models.</description>

      <title>Toward speedup without quantum coherent access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along with the development of quantum technology, finding useful applications of quantum computers has been a central pursuit. Despite various quantum algorithms have been developed, many of them often require strong input assumptions, which is hardware demanding. In particular, recent advances on dequantization have revealed that the quantum advantage is more of a mere artifact of strong input assumptions. In this work, we propose a variant of these algorithms, leveraging both classical and quantum resources. Provided the classical knowledge (the entries) of the matrix/vector of interest, a classical procedure is used to pre-process this information. Then they are fed into a quantum circuit which is shown to be a block encoding of the matrix of interest. From this block-encoding, we show how to use it to tackle a wide range of problems, including principal component analysis, linear equation solving, Hamiltonian simulation, preparing ground state, and data fitting. We also analyze our protocol, showing that both the classical and quantum procedure can achieve logarithmic complexity in the input dimension, thus implying its potential for near term realization. We then discuss several implications and corollaries of our result. First,, our results suggest there are certain matrices/Hamiltonians where our method can provide exponential improvement compared to the existing ones with respect to the sparsity. Regarding dense linear systems, our method achieves exponential speed-up with respect to the inverse of error tolerance, compared to the best previously known quantum algorithm for dense systems. Last, and most importantly, regarding quantum data fitting, we show how the output of our quantum algorithms can be leveraged to predict unseen data. Thus, it provides an end-to-end application, which has been an open aspect of the previous quantum data fitting algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus our attention on tripartite mixed states as initial states, and apply coherence concurrence to investigate quantum coherence properties in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole under phase damping, phase flip and bit flip channels, respectively. Several analytic complementary relationships based on coherence concurrence for tripartite subsystems are proposed. In the case of the bit flip channel, the behavior of the coherence concurrence is similar to the one of the phase damping channel, the accessible coherence concurrence always degrades as the Hawking acceleration rising, but sudden death never occurs, while the inaccessible coherence increases from zero monotonically. Interestingly, the coherence concurrence is decreasing at first and then increasing as the decay probability rising under phase flip channel. Unlike the case of tripartite pure states, the coherence concurrence of mixed state with X shape is equal to $l_1$ -norm of coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus our attention on two-qubit mixed states as initial states, and apply the geometric measure of quantum discord to investigate quantum discord properties in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole under phase damping, phase flip and bit flip channels, respectively. Several analytical complementary relationships based on quantum discords for bipartite subsystems are proposed. For the three channel noises, the behaviors of discords are similar, the accessible discords always degrade as the Hawking acceleration rising, but sudden death never occurs, while the inaccessible discords increase from zero monotonically. Interestingly, in the case of the bit flip channel and phase flip channel, the discords perform symmetrically with the decay probability rising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating cold atoms in traps is a key tool for numerous realizations of quantum simulators and quantum sensors. They require accurate modeling and characterization of the underlying trapping potentials. We introduce a technique based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer for in-situ characterization of weakly anharmonic potentials. By simulating the interferometer in an optical dipole trap, we can accurately determine its trap frequency and upper bounds onto anharmonicity magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Simulating Microwave-Controlled Spin Imaging with Free-Space Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent spin resonance techniques, such as nuclear and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, have revolutionized non-invasive imaging by providing spectrally resolved information about spin dynamics. Motivated by the recent emergence of electron microscopy methods capable of sensing microwave-excitations, we establish a theoretical framework for Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (SRS) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This technique combines microwave pump fields with focused electron probe beams to enable state-selective spin imaging at the atomic scale. Using scattering theory, we model the interaction between free-space electrons and electron spin systems, capturing both elastic and inelastic processes. The strongest effect of the spin system on the free electron is a magnetic phase shift. Our simulations demonstrate that phase shifts from individual electron spins are detectable in both image mode and diffraction mode. In principle, differential measurements under microwave control allow the extraction of local resonance frequencies that are influenced by the surrounding spin environment. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information (CFI), we identify imaging conditions that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), showing how defocus and beam width affect the measurement sensitivity. These findings establish a foundation for integrating SRS with high-resolution TEM, bridging spin spectroscopy and atomic-scale imaging, and enabling new capabilities in quantum spin research and nanoscale materials characterization.</description>

      <title>$\sigma$-VQE: Excited-state preparation of quantum many-body scars with shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a type of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which we denote the $\sigma$-VQE. It is designed to target mid-spectrum eigenstates and prepare quantum many-body scar states. The approach leverages the fact that noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are limited in their ability to generate generic highly-entangled states. This modified VQE pairs a low-depth circuit with an energy-selective objective that explicitly penalizes energy variance around a chosen target energy. The cost function exploits the limited expressibility of the shallow circuit as atypical low-entanglement eigenstates such as scar states are preferentially selected. We validate this mechanism across two complementary families of models that contain many-body scar states: the Shiraishi-Mori embedding approach, and the matrix-product state parent Hamiltonian construction. We define an unbiased estimation scheme for the nonlinear cost function that is compatible with qubit-wise commuting grouping and bitstring reuse. A proof-of-principle demonstration using a small-system instance was carried out on IBM Fez (Heron r2 QPU). These results motivate its use both as a practical "scar detector" and as a state-preparation primitive for initializing nonthermal eigenstate-supported dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that random 1D Clifford brickwork circuits form (in expectation) good approximate quantum error correction codes in logarithmic depth. Our proof makes use of the statistical mechanics techniques for random circuits developed by Dalzell et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 010333], adapted extensively to our own purpose. We also consider exact error correction, where we give matching upper and lower bounds for the required depth in which random 1D Clifford brickwork circuits become error correcting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing low-temperature quantum thermometry and magnetometry via quadratic interactions in optomechanical-like systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard optomechanical sensors operating in the low-temperature regime often face fundamental precision limits imposed by vacuum fluctuations. Here, we demonstrate that moving beyond conventional radiation-pressure interactions and exploiting quadratic coupling can surpass these limits, generating intrinsic squeezing and non-Gaussian features in the probe state. We study quantum thermometry and magnetometry in a coupled two-resonator system, focusing on the estimation of a thermal bath temperature and an external magnetic field. The resonators are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with a common bath, while a weak magnetic field acts on one of the resonators. We perform measurements on a single resonator, which serves as the probe for estimating both parameters. We compute the quantum Fisher information of the probe for two different interaction models between the resonators. Our results show that the counter-rotating terms in the quadratic interaction naturally induce squeezing at intermediate coupling and strong non-Gaussian correlations as the coupling increases further. These effects yield orders-of-magnitude enhancement in sensitivity in the low-temperature and weak-field regimes compared to standard radiation-pressure couplings. Finally, we investigate multiparameter estimation and find that, although the optimal measurements remain compatible, statistical correlations between parameters prevent the simultaneous estimation of temperature and magnetic field from attaining single-parameter precision.</description>

      <title>Experimental Asynchronous Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Cryptographic Conferencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) protocol, which distributes identical secure keys to user groups, is a crucial component of the quantum network. Previous experimental works have implemented the measurement-device-independent (MDI) QCC, of which the key rate in an $N$-user network scales down as $R\sim O(\eta^N)$, respectively. Building on the MDI QCC protocol, the asynchronous MDI (AMDI) QCC protocol theoretically integrates the mode pairing scheme into QCC, significantly boosting the key rate to $R\sim O(\eta)$, which is independent of the number of users, and thus demonstrating greater application potential. Experimentally, in this work, we implement the three-user AMDI QCC network without global phase tracking by adopting the fast Fourier transform-based frequency difference estimation and the phase drift compensation technique. Finally, we achieve a key rate of about $4.470\times10^{-9}$ bits per pulse under a maximum overall loss of about 59.6 dB. This work provides a scalable solution for the development of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Information Gain in Non-ideal Quantum Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing a quantum measurement yields two different results: a classical outcome drawn from a probability distribution, according to Born's rule, and a quantum outcome corresponding to the post-measurement state. Quantum devices that provide both outcomes can be described through quantum instruments. In a realistic scenario, one can expect that the observer's obtained classical and quantum outcomes are non-ideal: this can be due to experimental limitations, but could also be explained by adversarial interference, that is, a second party that disturbs the device through a concealed measurement to obtain information. The second scenario can be interpreted through quantum compatibility, as it implies that both the observer's instrument and the adversary's measurement can be performed simultaneously. In this work, we show how the noise of the observer's device relates to the amount of information that the adversary can obtain. We study scenarios in which the adversary aims to acquire information on the same basis as the observer's measurement, or on a mutually unbiased basis with respect to the observer's basis. In both cases, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the compatibility of a single qubit non-ideal quantum instrument and a noisy meter, from which we obtain the maximum amount of information that the adversary can extract in terms of the noise parameters of the observer's instrument. Finally, we provide the device implementation from the adversary's point of view for the same basis scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited detection of arrival time and carrier frequency of time-dependent signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of both the arrival time and carrier frequency of light pulses are essential for time-frequency-encoded quantum technologies. Quantum mechanics, however, imposes fundamental limits on the simultaneous determination of these quantities. In this work, we derive and experimentally verify the quantum uncertainty bounds governing joint time-frequency measurements. We show that when detection is restricted to finite time windows, the problem is naturally described by a quantum rotor, rendering the commonly used Heisenberg uncertainty relation inapplicable. We further propose an optimal detection scheme that saturates these fundamental limits. By sampling the Q-function, we demonstrate the reconstruction of the Wigner function beyond the harmonic oscillator. Using an experimental implementation based on a quantum pulse gate, we confirm that the proposed scheme approaches the ultimate quantum limit for simultaneous time-frequency measurements. These results provide a new framework for joint time-frequency detection with direct implications for precision measurements and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Induced Resilience of Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body devices suffer from imperfections that destabilize dynamics and limit scalability. We show that the dynamical growth of entanglement can intrinsically protect generic quantum dynamics against coherent and perturbative noise. Through rigorous theoretical analysis of general quantum dynamics and numerical simulations of spin chains and fermionic lattices, we prove that entanglement-entropy growth confines the influence of local Hamiltonian perturbations, thereby suppressing errors in dynamical errors. The degree of protection correlates quantitatively with the entanglement entropy of subsystems on which the perturbations act, and applies broadly to both analog quantum simulators and real-time control protocols. This entanglement-induced resilience is conceptually distinct from quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling: it passively leverages native many-body correlations without additional qubits, measurements, or control overhead. Our results reveal a generic mechanism linking entanglement growth to dynamical stability and provide practical guidelines for designing noise-resilient quantum devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying the causal structure of quantum channels is essential for verifying quantum networks and certifying quantum resources. We introduce a characterization-free protocol enabling two isolated players, Alice and Bob, to classify and identify the definite-order strategy adopted by an unknown environment mediating their channels. Without assuming knowledge of their devices or the environment, the players infer the causal order solely from input-output statistics by testing Markovian conditions that we prove are necessary and sufficient for each strategy class. Remarkably, we prove that even with a minimal random channel consisting of two-outcome POVMs and two-state preparations, the protocol retains full performance with probability one. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol on an optical platform, reliably distinguishing between several strategies. Our results provide a strong and robust tool for causal inference in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Telemetry-Based Server Selection in the Quantum Internet via Cross-Layer Runtime Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet will allow clients to delegate quantum workloads to remote servers over heterogeneous networks, but choosing the server that minimizes end-to-end execution time is difficult because server processing, feedforward classical communication, and entanglement distribution can overlap in protocol-dependent ways and shift the runtime bottleneck. We propose $T_{\max}$, a lightweight runtime score that sums coarse telemetry from multiple layers to obtain a conservative ranking for online server selection without calibrating weights for each deployment. Using NetSquid discrete-event simulations of a modified parameter-blind VQE (PB-VQE) workload, we evaluate $T_{\max}$ on pools of 10,000 heterogeneous candidates (selecting among up to 100 per decision) across crossover and bottleneck-dominated regimes, including temporal jitter scenarios and jobs with multiple shots. $T_{\max}$ achieves single-digit mean regret normalized by the oracle (below 10%) in both regimes and remains in the single-digit range under classical communication latency jitter for multi-shot jobs, while performance degrades for single-shot jobs under severe jitter. To connect performance to deployment planning, we derive an operating map based on requirements relating distance and entanglement rate requirements to protocol level counts, quantify how simple multiuser contention shifts the crossover, and use Sobol global sensitivity analysis to identify regime-dependent bottlenecks. These findings suggest that simple cross-layer telemetry can enable practical server selection while providing actionable provisioning guidance for emerging Quantum Internet services.</description>

      <title>Restriction-Based Certificate of Bipartite Schmidt Rank in Hypergraph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bipartite entanglement in qubit hypergraph states across an arbitrary fixed bipartition. Using the real equally weighted (REW) representation, the Schmidt rank across the cut can be computed as the real rank of a phase-cleaned cross-cut sign matrix. Whereas graph states admit an exact cut-rank rule, because the cross-cut phase is purely bilinear, hypergraph states typically contain higher-degree cross-cut interactions, for which the cut-rank rule fails. Our approach certifies entanglement by fixing a single computational-basis assignment on a subset of qubits, thereby selecting a submatrix on an active slice. When this restriction removes all higher-degree cross-cut residues, the remaining cross-cut phase becomes bilinear up to cut-local terms. We call the resulting submatrices residual-free bilinear cores and show that they yield an exponential Schmidt-rank lower bound in terms of the $\mathbb{F}_2$-rank of an exposed core matrix. We further give a combinatorial sufficient condition, phrased as a disjoint bridge matching, that guarantees the existence of large full-rank cores for broad families of CCZ-type bridge patterns, and we present a search-and-verify procedure that constructs and certifies such cores directly from the hyperedge description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced quantum communication protocols require high-visibility quantum interference between photons generated at distant nodes, which places stringent demands on optical synchronization. Conventionally, synchronization of optical wave packets relies on pulsed sources and precise optical path stabilization. An alternative approach employs continuous-wave (CW) photon-pair sources, where temporal indistinguishability is enforced by post-selecting detection events within a coincidence window $\tau_w$ shorter than the photon coherence time $T_c$. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the quantitative relation between relevant time scales, achievable interference visibility, and usable multi-photon rates has remained unclear. Here, we develop in detail and experimentally validate a theoretical framework that quantitatively describes time-resolved multi-photon interference in the CW regime. We explicitly incorporate detector timing jitter, photon coherence time, and temporal post-selection. The model is verified using four-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements. Based on this validated framework, we determine the coincidence window that maximizes usable four-photon rates for a target visibility. Finally, we compare CW and pulsed SPDC sources under equivalent indistinguishability constraints and show that CW operation can achieve comparable rates while relaxing optical synchronization requirements.</description>

      <title>Correcting coherent quantum errors by going with the flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of a given quantum error correction (QEC) code depends upon the noise model that is assumed. Independent Pauli noise, applied after each quantum operation, is a simplistic noise model that is easy to simulate and understand in the context of stabilizer codes. Although such a noise model is artificial, it is equivalent to independent, random, unbiased qubit rotations. What about spatially or temporally correlated qubit rotations? Such a noise model is applicable to global operations (e.g., NMR or ESR), common control sources (e.g., lasers), or slow drift (e.g., charge or magnetic noise) in various qubit technologies. In the worst case, such errors can combine constructively and result in a post-correction failure rate that increases with the number of error correction cycles. However, we show that this worst case does not generally arise unless taking active corrective actions while performing QEC. That is, by employing virtual Pauli frame updates ("passive" error correction) rather than physical corrections ("active" error correction), coherent errors do not compound appreciably. Starting in a random Pauli frame is also advantageous. In fact, through perturbation theory arguments and supporting numerical simulations, we show that the logical qubit performance beyond distance 3 for correlated single-qubit Hamiltonian noise models (i.e., global errant qubit rotations), when employing these "lazy" strategies, essentially matches the performance of Pauli noise model with the same process fidelity (fidelity after one application). In a more general circuit model of noise, correlations may add constructively within syndrome extraction rounds but Pauli frame randomization from passive error correction mitigates this effect across multiple rounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing DNA sequences without a reference, known as de novo assembly, is a complex computational task involving the alignment of overlapping fragments. To address this problem, a usual strategy is to map the assembly to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, which can be solved by different quantum algorithms. In this work, we focus on three versions of the Feedback-based Algorithm, a protocol that eliminates classical optimization loops via measurement feedback. We analyze long-read DNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and human mitochondrial DNA using standard FALQON, second-order FALQON (SO-FALQON), and time-rescaled FALQON (TR-FALQON). Numerical results show that both variants improve convergence to the ground state and increase success probabilities at reduced circuit depths. These findings indicate that enhanced feedback-driven dynamics are effective for solving combinatorial problems on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>On Hydrodynamic Formulations of Quantum Mechanics and the Problem of Sparse Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic reformulations of the Schr\"odinger equation suggest an interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of a fluid flowing on configuration space. In the discrete hydrodynamic view, this fluid is not fundamental but emerges from many underlying microscopic fluid components whose collective behavior reproduces quantum phenomena. The most developed realization of this idea is the discrete many interacting worlds (MIW) framework, in which discrete particle-like worlds interact via inter-world forces and quantum probabilities are grounded in direct world counting. But there is also an older, continuous version of MIW. After reviewing the hydrodynamic and MIW formalisms, and emphasizing some of their interpretational advantages over the Everettian Many Worlds and Bohmian approaches, we argue that all discrete hydrodynamic models face a generic structural difficulty, which we call the problem of sparse ontology. Because wavefunctions typically branch under decoherence, the discrete components of the fluid are repeatedly partitioned into sub-ensembles, thereby thinning their density in configuration space and driving the dynamics away from the quantum regime once the components become sufficiently sparse. We conclude that successful hydrodynamic completions of quantum mechanics plausibly require an essentially continuous ontology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization for Decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory, and Belief Propagation (BP) is one of the most popular methods for LDPC code decoding. However, BP may encounter convergence issues and suboptimal performance, especially for short-length codes and in high-noise channels. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a type of Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by minimizing a problem-specific cost function. In this paper, we present a QAOA-based decoding framework for LDPC codes by formulating a decoding cost function that incorporates both parity-check constraints and soft channel reliability information. The resulting optimization problem is solved using QAOA to search for low-energy configurations corresponding to valid codewords. We test the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments and compare its performance with BP decoding. The experimental results demonstrate that the QAOA-based decoder achieves a higher probability of correctly recovering the transmitted codeword than BP across multiple experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum transport in non-Markovian open Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build an exact framework to evaluate heat, energy, and particle transport between Gaussian reservoirs mediated by a quadratic quantum system. By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system's initial state. In the steady-state, weak-coupling limit, we recover results analogous to those of the well-known Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We conclude our discussion by demonstrating an application of the method to a prototypical fermionic system. Our results uncover a regime of transient negative heat conductance contingent upon the initial system preparation, providing a clear signature of non-trivial out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity, Confinement and Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic holographic study of Krylov complexity for a wide class of confining quantum field theories. Using the geometric prescription that identifies the time derivative of the complexity with the proper momentum of a massive probe, we analyse radial geodesics in several top-down gravity duals exhibiting confinement and a mass gap. In all geometries with a smooth infrared end-of-space we uncover a robust and universal qualitative feature: Krylov complexity exhibits oscillatory behaviour. The oscillation frequency is controlled by the confinement scale, while the amplitude depends on both the ultraviolet cutoff and the infrared scale. Additional conserved charges modify these patterns without altering their qualitative structure. We further compare our results with the Krylov complexity of the longitudinally perturbed Ising model. The qualitative agreement suggests that oscillatory behaviour of Krylov complexity constitutes a universal signature of confinement and provides a sensitive probe of infrared reorganisation in strongly coupled quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Generator-Enhanced Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of the tensor network generator-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) framework to address the traveling salesman problem (TSP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge. Our approach employs a tensor network Born machine based on automatically differentiable matrix product states (MPS) as the generative model, using the Born rule to define probability distributions over candidate solutions. Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing. The $k$-site variants, which put more focus on local correlations, show better results compared to the full-MPS case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present trainsum, a versatile Python package for doing computations with multidimensional quantics tensor trains: https://github.com/fh-igd-iet/trainsum. Using the Array API standard together with opt_einsum, trainsum allows the effortless approximation of tensors or functions by tensor trains independent of their shape or dimensionality. Once approximated, our package can perform normal arithmetic operations with quantics tensor trains, including addition, Einstein summations and element-wise transformations. It can be therefore used for generic computations with applications in simulation, data compression, machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral Decimation of Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theory of spectral decimation for quantum many-body Hamiltonians and show that it provides a quantitative probe of emergent symmetries in statistically mixed spectra. Building on an analytical description of statistical mixtures, we derive an explicit expression for the size of a characteristic symmetry sector (CSS), defined as the largest subsequence of levels exhibiting non-Poissonian correlations. The CSS dimension is shown to be the size-biased average of the underlying symmetry sectors, establishing a direct link between spectral statistics and Hilbert-space structure. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic settings: Hilbert-space fragmentation and disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL). In fragmented systems, the CSS reproduces the mixture prediction and isolates correlated subsectors even when the full spectrum appears nearly Poissonian. In the disordered Heisenberg chain, spectral decimation reveals the gradual emergence of integrability through a shrinking CSS, whose statistics exhibit signatures consistent with local integrals of motion. We introduce a characteristic symmetry entropy (CSE) as a finite-size scaling observable and extract, within accessible system sizes, the crossover exponents. Our results establish spectral decimation as a controlled, unbiased and computationally inexpensive diagnostic of hidden structure in many-body spectra, capable of distinguishing between chaotic dynamics, statistical mixtures, and emergent integrability.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium and dynamical quantum phase transitions in dipolar atomic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An atomic Josephson junction realized with dipolar bosons in a double-well potential can be described by an extended Bose-Hubbard model in which dipolar interactions generate an effective on-site interaction and nearest-neighbor pair tunneling. Using mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we investigate how this correlated process affects zero-temperature equilibrium and dynamical properties of the system. In equilibrium, we show that pair tunneling induces ground-state parity modulations and significantly reshapes the phase diagram, producing qualitative changes in the quantum phase transitions toward NOON and phase-NOON states, as well as quantitative shifts of the critical points. Out of equilibrium, we demonstrate that it modifies the conditions for macroscopic quantum self-trapping, and assess its impact by comparing mean-field and fully quantum evolution, including the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: This brief note is written with a somewhat similar purpose to Earman's 2011 paper on the conceptual problems on the Unruh effect. However, we confine ourselves to Sewell's modular approach to the Unruh effect, which is based on the theorems of Tomita-Takesaki and Bisognano-Wichmann. This approach is rigorous, and has an advantage of being model-independent. However, we will see that a number of conceptual problems remain unsolved on this approach.</description>

      <title>Zero-point energy of a trapped ultracold Fermi gas at unitarity: squeezing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and suppressing the Pauli principle to produce a superfluid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The zero-point energy of a trapped ultracold Fermi gas at unitarity is investigated in relation to the combined effects of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle. This lowest allowed quantum state is a superfluid state which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically. The method used for the current investigation is based on a recent series of papers that proposed microscopic dynamics based on normal modes to describe superfluidity instead of real-space Cooper pairs. This approach yielded excellent agreement with experimental data for multiple properties and allowed the microscopic behavior underlying these results as well as the basis of universal behavior to be analyzed in detail using the group theoretic basis of this general N-body approach. This microscopic picture is now used to illucidate the roles played by the uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle in determining the energy and character of the lowest allowed quantum state including the squeezed character of this superfluid state and the suppression of the Pauli principle.</description>

      <title>Revealing Pseudo-Fermionization and Chiral Binding of One-Dimensional Anyons using Adiabatic State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional statistics give rise to quantum behaviors that differ fundamentally from those of bosons and fermions. While two-dimensional anyons play a major role in strongly correlated systems and topological quantum computing, the nature of their one-dimensional (1D) counterparts remains the subject of intense debate, with renewed interest fueled by recent experimental progress. Theoretically, 1D anyons are predicted to host exotic many-body phases and quantum phase transitions, yet experimental signatures have remained elusive. Using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we prepare two-body ground states of the 1D anyon-Hubbard model by combining Hamiltonian engineering via quasiperiodic drives and adiabatic state manipulation. We uncover the effects of statistical interactions that lead to pseudo-fermionization and to the formation of chiral bound states when particles remain close together. Our results establish a link between lattice and continuum realizations of anyon models, and mark important steps towards the precise control of 1D anyons in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Toward a CMOS-integrated quantum diamond biosensor based on NV centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress toward a CMOS-integrated quantum diamond biosensing platform that combines nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with a custom 40 nm CMOS Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array. The system integrates on-chip active quenching and digital readout with external FPGA-based photon counting, compact microwave delivery, and practical optical excitation and collection schemes to support widefield optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). System-level design considerations spanning fluorescence collection efficiency, detector count-rate capability, and microwave homogeneity are analyzed with biological compatibility and scalability in mind. Using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION)-labeled HEK293T cells as a representative use case, simple dipole-field estimates indicate that sub-$\mu$T sensitivity is required to resolve ODMR shifts within typical ensemble linewidths. Based on the proposed architecture and efficiency analysis, a magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 90 nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ per pixel is estimated. These results outline a practical path from optics-heavy quantum diamond microscopes toward compact, CMOS-integrated NV-based biosensors for quantitative magnetic imaging in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>Is a covariant virtual tachyon viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sidney Coleman has noted that superluminal particles or observers would be able to go back in time and have no definite trajectory according to subluminal observers, while not violating Lorentz invariance [1]. Recently, Dragan and Ekert have significantly developed similar ideas even further, which lead to formulation of ``quantum principle of relativity'' that intimately links the two theories [2]. However, field theory descriptions of an on-shell tachyon, described by scalar field $\phi$ with negative mass squared parameter, lead to violation of basic principles of relativity or quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate whether purely virtual tachyons can be consistent within the fakeon framework-the only known viable formulation of purely virtual particles. We identify two fatal obstructions. First, Lorentz boosts mix creation and annihilation operators, rendering the canonical commutation relations non-invariant despite formal invariance of the vacuum. Second, the real part of the tachyon Feynman propagator and Wheeler propagator have disjoint support, preventing application of both the fakeon prescription and Wheeler-Feynman absorber mechanism. Interactions with stable Standard Model fields further violate Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, and we provide quantitative limit on coupling strength of such scenario. Our analysis excludes possibility of formulating covariant quantum field theory of interacting virtual tachyons.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown as an entanglement transition driven by continuous measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Kondo screening by a local magnetic field from the perspective of a measurement-driven entanglement transition in a monitored quantum system. Here, the Kondo coupling leads to the growth in entanglement of an impurity spin with it's fermionic environment, while the local field plays the role of a continuous observer. Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid. Various impurity signatures such as the spectral function and thermalisation of impurity observables are used to characterise this entanglement transition. These results offer insight into the interplay of decoherence and measurement in governing the dynamics of a prototypical quantum system.</description>

      <title>Tune-out wavelength for the thulium atom near 576 nm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the theoretical prediction and measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the ground state of the thulium atom in a linearly polarized optical dipole trap with a wavelength of approximately 576 nm. The measurements were conducted using a combination of trap frequency and RF loss spectroscopy, thus making it possible to separate the scalar and tensor parts of the total polarizability without measurements in the range of negative total polarizability. The calculated tune-out wavelength is consistent with the measured one of $575.646_{-0.014}^{+0.016}$ nm in air. The existence of the zero in the polarizability for the Tm ground state was confirmed by the trap loss experiment, which also made it possible to refine the tune-out wavelength to $575.646_{-0.004}^{+0.004}$. Despite the presence of an imaginary part of the polarizability at some wavelengths, it was experimentally demonstrated that, with a proper choice of the dipole trap polarization, it was possible to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation of thulium atoms in the range from 575.348 to 575.689 nm, covering the tune-out wavelength.</description>

      <title>Suppressed correlation-spreading in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with strong interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of non-ergodic behavior in the real-time evolution of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, where the initial state is a doubly occupied density-wave state. We show that the occupation dynamics at strong interactions is dominated by doublon-holon exchange which leads to a domain wall excitation and propagation. The latter manifests as a negated staggered pattern in the density-density correlations. While the single-particle and the pair correlation functions show highly localized correlations that decay rapidly away from the nearest neighbor. We show that the time scale of the domain-wall excitations depends on the inverse of the interaction strength and therefore dictates the slow relaxation dynamics. In the presence of a parabolic trap, the occupation dynamics at the edges become frozen and further suppresses the propagation of correlations. This suppression happens even for trap strengths weaker than the tunneling rate. We also show that the model can be mapped to an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model in the limit of strong interactions and that the correlation-propagation velocity in the original model is well captured by the group velocity of the spin-wave excitation in the effective spin model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonrelativistic system made of two quantum particles constrained to move on a line and a spin located at a fixed point of the line. Initially the two particles are in a maximally entangled state and the spin is down. The first particle interacts with the spin while the second particle is free, i.e., it does not interact neither with the first particle nor with the spin. We rigorously prove that there is a correlation between the state of the spin and the state of the second particle. More precisely, we show that, in a suitable scaling limit, if the first particle flips the spin, then the second particle possesses a definite momentum in the direction opposite to the spin.</description>

      <title>Efficient two-color Floquet control of the RKKY interaction in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Internal dynamics and guided motion in general relativistic quantum interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between internal degrees of freedom of quantum systems and their overall motion in an external gravitational field plays a central role in multiple extensions of Einstein's equivalence principle to quantum physics. While previous models of such effects were predominantly restricted to linearized gravity and often required the motion of quantum particles to follow prescribed world-lines, this letter shows how such phenomena can be understood using generally covariant semiclassical approximations in the framework of quantum field theory in curved space-times. This method provides a unification and generalization of previously established results, but also predicts new effects such as an influence of internal energies on field amplitudes, as well as correction terms to the internal Schr\"odinger equation that give rise to Berry phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Top Quark Pairs Produced at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence in top-antitop production at the LHC by comparing Standard Model predictions with CMS data across different kinematic regimes. Theory and experiment are statistically consistent in the near-threshold and boosted central regions, confirming that the spin-density framework captures the dominant helicity-interference structure. The intermediate-mass window shows a noticeable deviation, indicating enhanced sensitivity to radiative QCD effects. This work reinterprets measured spin-correlation data within a quantum-coherence framework, thereby introducing coherence as a complementary and experimentally grounded probe of the Standard Model spin structure and a potentially sensitive diagnostic of new-physics effects in the top-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry breaking on altermagnetism in CrSb and Formation of fragmented nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomena concerning altermagnets have opened up a window for unconventional analysis of the momentum space spin polarization (MSSP) of antiferromagnetic materials. Taking the example of one of the widely investigated altermagnets, CrSb, we explore the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation or breaking of altermagnetism. With the aid of DFT calculation and symmetry analysis, we study the behavior of MSSP in the altermagnetic bands of pristine CrSb, along with a few model structures designed from the pristine one by hypothetical vacancy engineering and interstitial doping. We show that the six-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine CrSb can be reduced to a two-fold rotational symmetry via vacancy and doping engineering. We discover the formation of fragmented nodal curves (FNCs) across the Brillouin zone when in an altermagnetic material when the symmetry is restricted to two-fold rotation. Unlike the typical nodal planes and axes, the location of the FNCs in the momentum space is found to be band-specific. The formation of FNCs is further validated by introducing uniaxial strain to CrSb and by examining the band structure of RbMnPO$_4$, as they both exhibit a two-fold rotational symmetry responsible for altermagnetism. We observe that, unlike the pristine case, these FNCs have the potential to manifest anomalous Hall conductivities (AHC), while the N\'eel vector orients along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This flexibility of the AHC will pave the way for the application of altermagnets in the futuristic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Gate Count with Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian formulations of lattice field theories provide access to real-time dynamics, but their simulation is difficult to implement efficiently. Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are at the center of time evolution computation, either on quantum hardware or classically, for instance with the use of tensor networks. While low-order Trotterizations remain the standard choice due to their simplicity, higher-order schemes offer the potential for improved efficiency. In this work we outline a short guide to Trotter-Suzuki schemes and their implementations in general. To help with this, we highlight new efficient schemes found by our optimization framework, and demonstrate their performance on the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Topological Floquet Green's function zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum emulation using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and an increased interest in topological Green's function zeros in condensed matter systems, we here study Green's function zeros in topological Floquet systems. We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green's-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI. In the vicinity of special points in the free fermion phase diagram and using tailor-made interactions which lead to the Floquet version of symmetric mass generation, we analytically calculate both edge and bulk Green's functions. Just as in the case of continuum time evolution, topological bands of Green's function zeros may also contribute to the topological invariant. However, contrary to the case of continuum time evolution, Floquet Green's functions can have zeros even in the absence of interactions. Finally, we also discuss an implementation of this Floquet system in a digital quantum emulator: We present a circuit which encodes the interaction under consideration and pinpoint the observables carrying information about the topological Green's function boundary zeros.</description>

      <title>Minimal Time Robust for Two Superconducting Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.08056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F &gt; 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F &gt; 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F &gt; 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

      <title>Classification and reconstruction for single-pixel imaging with classical and quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-pixel cameras are an effective solution for imaging outside the visible spectrum, where traditional CMOS/CCD cameras have challenges. When combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel visualization can potentially be accelerated via quantum machine learning, thereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work, we simulated a single-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and FashionMNIST items of clothing dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstructing images based on these measurements using classical fully-connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed the best accuracies of 96% and 95% for MNIST and 84% and 81% for FashionMNIST, respectively, after 6 training epochs, which is a quite competitive result. In the area of intersection by the number of parameters of the quantum and classical classifiers, the quantum demonstrates results no worse than the classical one, even better by a value of about 1-3%. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs; the best structural similarity index measure values were 0.76 and 0.26 for MNIST and 0.73 and 0.22 for FashionMNIST, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the derivation of a recursive formula for integrals of products of $N$ Hermite polynomials, establishing a numerically stable scheme for their accurate evaluation in computer codes. The derivation is notably simple and leverages solely the well-established properties of Hermite polynomials and the method of integration by parts. Importantly, our formulation completely circumvents explicit factorials, thereby preventing potential numerical instabilities and overflows, while facilitating high-precision computations for large indices. These findings are of significant relevance to a variety of areas in physics and mathematics. In particular, they offer an efficient and accurate framework for calculating two- and three-body matrix elements in ab initio simulations of few-body systems under a 1D harmonic confinement using the Configuration Interactions approach. A numerical subroutine implementing the recursive formula is provided as supplemental material.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, separability and correlation topology of quantum systems over parametric space of interaction potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard understanding of formal quantum theory is based upon the belief that the state of two interacting quantum systems can jointly evolve as, either an entangled state, e.g. in case of measurement or decoherence, or a separable state, e.g. in case of gate operations, through two different processes, i.e. process-1 and process-2, respectively, as suggested by von Neumann, although nothing much is known about such processes in terms of physical interaction. The present work, exploring the correlation topologies of two interacting quantum systems in parametric space of their interaction potential, reveals that process-1 and process-2 are not different kinds of physical interactions but depend on the interaction parameters to result in either an entangled or a separable state. However, under energy conservation restriction, it is impossible to travel from one maximally-entangled state to another in the topological space by continuously varying such interaction parameters without crossing an intermediate separable state, and vice-versa. Nevertheless, a maximal entangled state is shown to be achieved by violating energy conservation utilizing the energy-time uncertainty or a catalytic separable ancillia. The work explores the nature of interaction potential needed to rotate a qubit state on the entire Bloch sphere, thereby revealing a novel method of measuring the qubit phase avoiding its state-collapse. Further, the manipulation of the degree of non-local entanglement of two space-like apart entangled-qubits in a controlled manner by local unitary operation on one has been illustrated. The generalization of process-1 and process-2 in terms of interaction potential to create entanglement or separability suggests a necessary revisit of the fundamental quantum paradoxes and several other quantum limitations including decoherence for advancing the field of quantum technology as a whole.</description>

      <title>Full-field mapping of spatially varying polarization entanglement generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon states generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can display entanglement in all degrees of freedom (DoFs) of light, including spatial, temporal, and polarization. The coupling between different DoFs of a two-photon state has been shown to display rich structures that enable novel and robust information processing schemes. While existing literature has studied these couplings by post-selecting the SPDC field, a comprehensive understanding of the inherent spatial-polarization coupling produced in the SPDC process is still lacking. This work produces a full spatial map of the polarization entanglement generated across the entire SPDC field. We observe an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$, which, together with a certified spatial dimensionality of 148, could potentially offer access to a 251-dimensional hyperentanglement. The spatial-polarization coupling manifests as radially or linearly varying polarization-entangled states, whose wavefunctions are dependent on the transverse momenta of the down-converted photons and the pump beam, respectively. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the coupling between entanglement in different DoFs for future quantum technologies.</description>

When accelerated by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes binary integer programming, which is still NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables, making qubit consumption independent of the increasing number of Benders cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks for sequential solutions, which does not scale with the number of generators. Finally, the simulation results on both 4-generator and the IEEE bus-118 systems demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed algorithm, indicating its superior qubit and runtime efficiency over classical and baseline quantum approaches on the D-Wave QPU platform.</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Incompatibility in Parallel vs Antiparallel Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the joint measurability of incompatible qubit observables on ensembles of parallel and antiparallel spin-1/2 pairs. In parallel configuration, both spins are prepared in the same state, whereas in antiparallel case, each spin is paired with its flipped counterpart. We show that the antiparallel configuration uniquely enables exact simultaneous prediction of three mutually orthogonal spin components -- an advantage not achievable with parallel states. Extending beyond three observables, we examine joint measurability for larger sets of spin measurements and further generalize our analysis to state configurations beyond the parallel and antiparallel cases. As we show, our results reveal a deep connection to the 'mean King retrodiction task' proposed by Vaidman, Aharonov, and Albert, and have implications for a cryptographic protocol introduced by Jeffrey Bub. We further demonstrate how the enhanced compatibility in the antiparallel configuration can facilitate efficient estimation of unknown measurement devices. Finally, we discuss prospects for experimentally realizing the enhanced measurement compatibility in antiparallel configuration by analyzing the effect on finite sub-ensembles of states.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Authentication Protocols for Advanced Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, digital quantum computers are limited to shallow circuits on the order of a thousand layers due to system noise and qubit decoherence. Thus, every step of a simulation must be as efficient as possible. Modifying the recent Givens Rotation state preparation by Chai et al and ladder operator block encoding method by Simon et al, we propose a scattering state preparation method that approximates the fermionic wave packets by localizing them in space, reducing circuit depth by nearly half, while also preserving fermionic anti-commutation relations. Using MPS simulations, we show that these approximated wave packets approach the exact wave packets in weakly interacting critical theories; and then show its immediate application on modern day hardware with IonQ's Forte 1 machine.</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and has the potential to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>A Fully Device-Independent Ternary Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Based on the Impossible Colouring Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Ternary Fully Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (TFDIQKD) protocol based on the two-party Impossible Colouring pseudo-telepathy game, utilizing maximally entangled qutrit states to enable secure key generation between distant parties. The protocol harnesses Bell inequality violations that arise from contextuality in the Kochen-Specker theorem, thereby offering a quantum advantage in a task that is classically impossible and eliminating reliance on assumptions about the internal functioning of quantum devices. A specially designed qutrit quantum circuit is used for state preparation. Security and device independence are rigorously analyzed within a composable framework, employing Bell-inequality violations, smooth min-entropy, von Neumann entropy, and Shannon entropy. The protocol achieves optimal key rates in the ideal case and maintains security under significant noise, with a finite-key analysis that supports its practical viability. Overall, the protocol operates within an adequate security framework and demonstrates an improved key generation rate compared to standard quantum key distribution schemes, highlighting the potential of high-dimensional quantum systems for secure communication.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of discrete-continuous quantum circuits with multimodal diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts and circuit depths, showcasing the ability of the method to outperform existing approaches in gate counts and under noisy conditions. Additionally, we show that a simple post-optimization scheme allows us to significantly improve the generated ans\"atze. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for machine learning with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Recent developments have introduced feedback-based quantum reservoir systems, which process temporal information with comparatively fewer components and enable real-time computation while preserving the input history. Motivated by their promising empirical performance, in this work, we study the approximation capabilities of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing. More specifically, we are concerned with recurrent quantum neural networks, which are quantum analogues of classical recurrent neural networks. Our results show that regular state-space systems can be approximated using quantum recurrent neural networks without the curse of dimensionality and with the number of qubits only growing logarithmically in the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. Notably, our analysis demonstrates that quantum recurrent neural networks are universal with linear readouts, making them both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time processing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound, and hence that stability always holds at high temperature. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analog simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

Abstract: A recent work considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider the more efficient representation of the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is discretized by using the Green's function of the discrete Laplacian operator under the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the continuum Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian and the discretized one proposed here guarantee that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields are decoupled and commute with the corresponding Hamiltonian. Thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate count for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy, and Hamiltonian parameters in lattice units. The gate cost here for implementing the time evolution of the gauge field is reduced at least by a factor on the order of $10^8$ for modest lattice size and accuracy level compared with the previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady-state coherence in open quantum systems is crucial for quantum technologies, yet its behavior is not fully understood due to the interplay between collective and individual decoherence. While collective decoherence is thought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe this because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic oscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing a tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically solving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence depends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under partial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex steady-state coherence behaviors. Our results offer new insights into the role of non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and serve as a benchmark for evaluating approximate methods in modelling quantum processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. We show that the energy spectrum of any entanglement-compressed quantum state must have large support if most energy eigenstates are highly entangled, an assumption supported by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that if the compressed quantum state minimizes expected energy, then its energy spectrum decays with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues under a convex relaxation of the compression constraint. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product states do not decay exponentially.</description>

Abstract: The cubic phase state constitutes a nonlinear resource that is essential for universal quantum computing protocols. However, constructing such non-classical states faces many challenges. In this work, we present a protocol for generating a cubic phase state with high fidelity. The protocol is based on a set of Gaussian operations assisted by a detection operation. To find the proper set of parameters that results in both high fidelity and high detection probability, we provide a numerical multiparameter optimization. We investigate a broad range of target states and study how parameter imperfections influence fidelity.</description>

Abstract: While the capabilities of quantum hardware have significantly advanced in recent years, executing quantum algorithms as quantum circuits at the lowest possible cost remains crucial, regardless of the hardware progress. We are developing a quantum-state-dependent circuit optimizer called AQCEL. Our guiding principle, implemented as the AQCEL optimization protocol, is to optimize quantum circuits by measuring the states of the control qubits to identify and eliminate unnecessary control operations. In this paper, we introduce two key improvements: the state label manager that reduces unnecessary state measurements and the $CX$-pair removal process that eliminates redundant gate pairs. These enhancements significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates, improving the fidelity of quantum circuits executed on quantum hardware. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply AQCEL to quantum circuits for the quantum parton shower algorithm. Experimental results using the IBM quantum computer show a substantial reduction in gate counts and an improvement in fidelity compared to the conventional optimization technique as well as the original AQCEL protocol. Our findings highlight the potential of state-dependent circuit optimization for enhancing the performance of quantum algorithms on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and coding transitions of Haar-random quantum codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random $\textit{stabilizer}$ codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher $\textit{detection}$ threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer which may be useful in neutron interferometry.</description>

      <title>Universality of Many-body Projected Ensemble for Learning Quantum Data Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML. For practicality, we propose an Incremental MPE variant with layer-wise training to improve the trainability. Numerical experiments on clustered quantum states and quantum chemistry datasets validate MPE's efficacy in learning complex quantum data distributions.</description>

Abstract: We improve on our version of the second law of thermodynamics as a deterministic theorem for quantum spin systems in two basic aspects. The first concerns the general statement of the second law: spontaneous changes in an adiabatically closed system will always be in the direction of increasing mean entropy, which rises to a maximal value. Two specific examples concern the transition from pure to mixed states in two different universality classes of dynamics in one dimension, one being the exponential model, the other the Dyson model, the dynamics of the latter exhibiting strong graphical evidence of quantum chaos, as a consequence of the results of Albert and Kiessling on the Cloitre function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.</description>

      <title>Post-measurement states are (very) useful for measurement discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated L\"uders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superposition is the core feature that sets quantum theory apart from classical physics. Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers show promise to solve select problems otherwise intractable on classical computers. However, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices are currently prone to various sources of error. Quantum error correction (QEC) shows promise as a path towards fault tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes, in particular, have become ubiquitous throughout literature for their efficacy as a quantum error correcting code, and can execute quantum circuits via lattice surgery operations. Lattice surgery also allows for logical qubits to maneuver around the architecture, if there is space for it. Hardware used for near-term demonstrations have both spatially and temporally varying error results in logical qubits. By maneuvering logical qubits around the topology, an average logical error rate (LER) can be enforced. We propose cyclic qubit mappings (CQM), a dynamic remapping technique implemented during compilation to mitigate hardware heterogeneity by expanding and contracting logical qubits. In addition to LER averaging, CQM shows initial promise given it's minimal execution time overhead and effective resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the annealing time required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales inversely proportional to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy for improving the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains difficult. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate quadratic speedup of the exponential scaling exponent in time to solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charges is a fundamental process in physics. Here, we introduce a quantum-optical framework for controlling the emission of radiation of an electron in an intense laser field via squeezed vacuum states. By engineering the quantum fluctuations of the emission modes, we demonstrate that the probability of nonlinear Compton scattering can be significantly enhanced or suppressed through tunable squeezing amplitude and angle. We show numerically that our predictions are experimentally accessible with current squeezing technologies, establishing a new paradigm for quantum control in high-intensity light-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless quantum matter stems from low-energy descriptions using conformal field theory. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the underlying quantum geometry by considering finite many-body systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that probe the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. The former is less sensitive to decoherence than the latter, so it can provide robust experimental signatures of our predictions. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the emergent effective description. This is supported both by numerical simulations of gapless lattice models, and by exact results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, probing the full dynamical parameter space.</description>

      <title>Additional quantum many-body scars of the spin-$1$ $XY$ model with Fock-space cages and commutant algebras</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Local measurements and the entanglement transition in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition between short-range entangled (SRE) and long-range ordered (and therefore long-range entangled) states of infinite quantum spin chains, which is induced by local measurements. Specifically, we assume that the initial state is in a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phase with local symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = G \times H$, where $G$ is an Abelian subgroup. We show that the on-site measurements of the local $G$-charge on intervals of increasing lengths transform the initial SRE state into a family of states with increasingly long-range correlations. In particular, the post-measurement states cannot be uniformly short-range entangled. In the case where the initial state is obtained from a product state using a quantum cellular automaton, we construct the infinite-volume post-measurement state and exhibit almost local observables that are maximally correlated.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of Abrikosov vortices by scanning quantum magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>
