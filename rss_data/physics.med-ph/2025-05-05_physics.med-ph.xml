      <title>Impact of metal nanoparticles on cell survival predicted by the local effect model for cells in suspension and tissue. Part 1: Theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the change in cell survival predicted by the local effect model (LEM) for an irradiated cell containing metal nanoparticles (MNPs) depending on the distribution of neighboring cells and the uptake of MNPs into the cells. In this first part of the paper, the theoretical framework is described, which is based on analytical weighting functions for the energy deposition around a single metal nanoparticle and radially symmetric distributions of MNPs. The weighting functions allow calculation of the radial profile of the absorbed dose in the cell nucleus as well as the mean dose and the mean square of the dose in the nucleus. The latter two quantities determine cell survival according to the LEM. The weighting functions are applied to isolated cells in a localized MNP distribution, cells in solution, and densely packed cells in tissue. It is shown that only for the idealistic case of complete uptake of MNPs it is sufficient to consider an isolated cell, as this otherwise leads to a significant underestimation in more realistic situations. In the case of cells in tissue, the MNP concentration within the range of secondary particles around the cell must be taken into account. Different packing densities of the cells may lead to values differing by up to 30% for the mean dose in the cell nucleus, depending on the conceived scenario for the uptake of MNPs. The weighting function offers a versatile method for assessing cell survival under irradiation in the presence of MNPs by the LEM, which is more general than previously reported approaches.</description>

      <title>3D neuron growth and neurodevelopmental disorder modeling based on truncated hierarchical B-splines with multi-level local refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D neuron growth and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) deterioration exhibit complex morphological transformations as neurites differentiate into axons and dendrites, forming intricate networks driven by tubulin concentrations and neurotrophin signals. Conventional 2D models fall short of capturing such morphological complexity, prompting the need and development of advanced 3D computational approaches. In this paper, we present a complex 3D neuron growth model based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the phase field method, utilizing locally refined truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines). IGA offers isoparametric representation and higher-order continuity, which are essential for simulating the smooth, evolving interfaces of phase field neurites. In contrast, the phase field method can automatically handle diffuse interfaces and complex topological changes without explicit boundary tracking. This IGA-based phase field method enables accurate and efficient simulation of neurite extensions, branching, and retraction in a fully 3D setting. The THB-spline implementation supports multi-level local refinement, focusing computational resources on regions of active growth, while dynamic domain expansion adapts the simulation domain to extend with growing neurites. KD-tree-based interpolation ensures that phase field variables are accurately transferred onto newly refined meshes. NDDs associated neurite deterioration is simulated by modulating the driving force term within the phase field model to induce interface retraction. This comprehensive 3D framework enhances the accuracy of neurite morphology simulations, advancing the study of complex neuron development, network formation and NDDs.</description>

      <title>Determination of the absorbed dose in the brain with DICOM images using GATE/GEANT4 and MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the absorbed dose calculation for the cerebral region is refined using the Geant4 software, along with the ROOT and GATE programs. This approach provides a detailed statistical analysis of positron trajectories within a water medium, using a voxel-sized source based on PET imaging. By simulating positron displacement within a 4x4x4 mm3 voxel containing radioactive material mixed with water, and bordered by voxels of identical density, the exact absorbed dose in the brain can be precisely determined. PET images, processed in MATLAB, will complement this dosimetric analysis. Results are compared to established guidelines, such as MIRD Pamphlet 17 and ICRP 106, to validate the accuracy and consistency of the absorbed dose calculations. The primary aim of this research is to optimize the absorbed dose in the cerebral region using digital images from the Philips PET-CT Gemini GXL6 scanner at the Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine Service, University Hospital of Caracas. The absorbed dose is calculated with the GATE simulator, a Monte Carlo-based tool supported by the Geant4 and ROOT frameworks. The focus is on evaluating the positron displacement from the central voxel to neighboring voxels. Post-simulation, the program algorithms provide detailed data on absorbed doses for both gamma and beta radiation emitted by 18F. This simulation data is then integrated into PET DICOM images within MATLAB. Geometric calculations are applied to further enhance absorbed dose information by leveraging the voxel characteristics of the images, thus optimizing the absorbed dose depiction. Results will be benchmarked against standards like ICRP 109, MIRD Pamphlet 2, and ICRP 53 for validation and optimization.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Analysis of Brain MRI: Mutual Information and Pixel Intensity Patterns in Tumor vs. Normal Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of information theory in medical imaging, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offers powerful quantitative tools for analyzing structural differences in brain tissues. This study utilizes mutual information (MI) and pixel intensity distributions to differentiate between normal and tumor-affected brain MRI images. Mutual information analyses revealed significantly higher MI values in tumor images compared to normal ones, indicating greater internal similarity within tumor images. Pixel intensity analysis further demonstrated distinct distribution patterns between the two groups: tumor images showed pronounced pixel frequency concentrations within a specific intensity range (0.3, 0.4), suggesting predictable structural characteristics. Conversely, normal images exhibited broader, more uniform pixel intensity distributions across most intensity ranges, except for an initial peak observed in both groups. These findings highlight the capability of information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information and pixel intensity analysis, to effectively distinguish tumor tissue from normal brain structures, providing promising avenues for enhanced diagnostic and analytical methods in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Cochlear Implants: Measurement of the Localization Performance as a Function of Device Latency Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimodal cochlear implant users show poor localization performance. One reason for this is a difference in the processing latency between the hearing aid and the cochlear implant side. It has been shown that reducing this latency difference acutely improves the localization performance of bimodal cochlear implant users. However, due to the frequency dependency of both the device latencies and the acoustic hearing ear, current frequency-independent latency adjustments cannot fully compensate for the differences, leaving open which latency adjustment is best. We therefore measured the localization performance of eleven bimodal cochlear implant users for multiple cochlear implant latencies. We confirm previous studies that adjusting the interaural latency improves localization in all eleven bimodal cochlear implant users. However, the latency that leads to the best localization performance for most subjects was not at the latency calculated to compensate for the interaural difference at intermediate frequencies (1 kHz). Nine of eleven subjects localized best with a cochlear implant latency that was slightly shorter than the calculated latency compensation.</description>

      <title>Estimations of lung structural properties from a single propagation-based dark-field X-ray image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation, we applied a single-projection dark-field imaging technique to gain statistical information on the smallest airway structures within the lung$\unicode{x2014}$the alveoli$\unicode{x2014}$focusing on their size and number as key indicators of lung health. The algorithm employed here retrieves the projected thickness of the sample from a propagation-based phase contrast image using the transport-of-intensity equation. The first Born approximation is then used to isolate the dark-field signal associated with edge scattering, which increases the visibility of microstructure boundaries. PMMA spheres of known sizes were imaged first as an idealised alveolar model. The dark-field signal was then recovered from propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray images of the lungs of small mammals using this method. The retrieved dark-field signal was found to be proportional to both the alveolar size ($R^2 = 0.85$) and the number in projection ($R^2 = 0.69$), and these measurements could be combined to provide an estimate of the total surface area of the alveolar interfaces ($R^2 = 0.78$). This demonstrates the approach's ability to indicate lung health using the dark-field signal retrieved from a single-phase-contrast X-ray image.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Smoke -- A Rigorous Challenge for HVAC Air Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant air quality challenge as the smoke they produce can travel long distances and infiltrate indoor spaces. HVAC filters serve as a primary defense against this threat. In our study, we tested over 17 different types of commercially available filter media, including charged and uncharged synthetic, as well as fiberglass media, from leading global manufacturers, to assess their efficiency in removing smoke, using pine needle smoke as a proxy for wildfire smoke. Our findings revealed that charged polymer media, across all tested MERV grades, showed a rapid decline in smoke removal efficiency within minutes while causing no increase in airflow resistance. In contrast, mechanical media demonstrated more stable performance but experienced an increase in airflow resistance. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we examined smoke deposition on fiber media, revealing unique interactions that contribute to the decline in filtration performance. These results suggest the need to reconsider current standards - whose testing is centered around inorganic particle removal - and the applicability of their ratings to smoke filtration. Our study also highlights the critical need to develop standard testing methods and evaluation criteria specific to smoke particles in HVAC filters to better protect human occupants during wildfire events.</description>

      <title>Characterization of micro-SPECT system based on Timepix detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the characteristics of a prototype SPECT system based on the Timepix readout chip, with a MURA type encoding mask, were evaluated. The set-up has a small field of view and can be used in preclinical studies of drugs in small laboratory animals. Despite many existing test protocols developed and described in pertinent documents of national standard bodies and IAEA recommendation, they are not suitable for microtomographic systems based on semiconductor pixel detectors due to different detector technology, high spatial resolution and small area of interest. To measure their characteristics, special phantoms were developed, with a small "hot~region". Such micro-SPECT parameters as spatial resolution, contrast, linearity and system efficiency were studied using Tc-99m source. The detector calibration and data preprocessing are described.</description>

      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512x512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>In vivo validation of Wireless Power Transfer System for Magnetically Controlled Robotic Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the in vivo validation of an inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system integrated for the first time into a magnetically controlled robotic capsule endoscopy platform. The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</description>
