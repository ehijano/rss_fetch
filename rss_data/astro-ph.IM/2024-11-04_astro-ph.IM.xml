      <title>Galactic Neutral Hydrogen Structures Spectroscopy and Kinematics: Designing a Home Radio Telescope for 21 cm Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the methodology for creating a cost-efficient radio astronomy telescope that can be used to detect 21 cm emissions (1420.405 MHz) and determine the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen specifically in the Milky Way. By measuring the Doppler shifts of the 21 cm emission, the velocities of hydrogen clouds relative to Earth can be determined. This enables the identification of these clouds' movements, their positions within the galaxy's spiral arms, and their roles in the overall rotational dynamics of the Milky Way. The setup is designed to be accessible to amateurs, enabling others to conduct similar projects. The measurement apparatus consists of a 1-meter parabolic dish, a H1-LNA for 21 cm emissions, an SDR, and a Raspberry Pi. This paper also provides an overview of the data processing required to detect the hydrogen line and generate velocity profiles. Additionally, it examines RFI mitigation techniques, such as spectral filtering and instrument shielding, which enhance observational clarity even in urban environments like Los Angeles. This study also analyzes the observed velocities of different galactic arms, as well as measurements across the sky.</description>

      <title>TOPO: Time-Ordered Provable Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TOPO (Time-Ordered Provable Outputs), a tool designed to enhance reproducibility and data integrity in astrophysical research, providing a trustless alternative to data analysis blinding. Astrophysical research frequently involves probabilistic algorithms, high computational demands, and stringent data privacy requirements, making it difficult to guarantee the integrity of results. TOPO provides a secure framework for verifying reproducible data analysis while ensuring sensitive information remains hidden. Our approach utilizes deterministic hashing to generate unique digital fingerprints of outputs, and Merkle Trees to store outputs in a time-ordered manner. This enables efficient verification of specific components or the entire dataset while making it computationally infeasible to manipulate results - thereby mitigating the risk of human interference and confirmation bias, key objectives of blinding methods. We demonstrate TOPO's utility in a cosmological context using TOPO-Cobaya, showcasing how blinding and verification can be seamlessly integrated into Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations, rendering the process cryptographically provable. This method addresses pressing challenges in the reproducibility crisis and offers a robust, verifiable framework for astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>The Faint Particle Trigger for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Faint Particle Trigger (FPT) was developed for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to enhance the detection efficiency for faint signatures, produced by free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCP) predicted in several Standard Model (SM) extensions. A previous IceCube analysis has shown a reduced trigger efficiency in detecting FCP with a charge of e/3 due to the $\text{z}^2$ dependence of photon production processes. The FPT addresses this shortcoming by incorporating a so far unused hit type, so called SLC hits in the trigger decision. These are single isolated hits that are not used for triggering high energy signatures in IceCube. The FPT employs a sliding time window to analyze hits, utilizing four cuts to remove noise and bright background contributions. The noise contribution is effectively decreased to a few Hz by velocity and directional consistency of hit pairs. Furthermore a part of the dominating atmospheric muon rate is reduced, by requiring a minimum fraction of SLC hits in the trigger window. The FPT significantly improves the trigger efficiency by a factor of 1.55, compared to standard triggers, while increasing the event rate in IceCube by a factor 1.004. The trigger algorithm was tested and successfully deployed at South Pole in November 2023.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: the PIAA Nuller in the prototyping phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the coronagraphic IFU of RISTRETTO is to enable High Dispersion Coronagraphy of planets at a distance of 2$\lambda$/D from their star, without compromising on transmission. The new idea of a PIAA Nuller (PIAAN) allows contrast down to 10$^{-5}$ over large bandwidth $\ge$ 25%, with high transmission $\ge$ 70% at the distance of 2$\lambda$/D. While RISTRETTO will be installed on a VLT, this development is of tremendous importance for fully exploiting future ELTs XAO. We will discuss our PIAAN prototyping activities. This covers 1) the characterisation of our 2nd set of IFU bundles, with 3D-printed MLAs; 2) the characterisation of our first PIAA optics; 3) the integration of a high contrast bench, planned for prototyping of Front-End control strategies; 4) the characterisation of the PIAAN system on the bench.</description>

      <title>Characterization of more than three years of in-orbit radiation damage of SiPMs on GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage. With the increasing popularity of SiPMs among new spaceborne missions, especially on CubeSats, it is of paramount importance to characterize their performance in space environment. In this work, we report the in-orbit ageing of SiPM arrays, so-called multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs), using measurements acquired by the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over three years, which in duration is unique. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021, to a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a gamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and regularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar flares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched on January 13, 2022 also to a 550 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among other payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have flight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs, shielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in an LEO environment on a scientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of MPPCs being employed in future satellites.</description>

      <title>A generative model for Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs: selection functions for binary stars, giant planets, and compact object companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the effects of pulse shape changes on pulsar timing precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of pulses from pulsars are conventionally made by a template matching algorithm that compares a profile constructed by averaging a finite number of pulses to a long-term average pulse shape. However, the shapes of pulses can and do vary, leading to errors in TOA estimation. All pulsars show stochastic variations in shape, amplitude, and phase between successive pulses that only partially average out in averages of finitely many pulses. This jitter phenomenon will only become more problematic for timing precision as more sensitive telescopes are built. We describe techniques for characterizing jitter (and other shape variations) and demonstrate them with data from the Vela pulsar, PSR B0833$-$45. These include partial sum analyses; auto-and cross correlations between templates and profiles and between multifrequency arrival times; and principal component analysis. We then quantify how pulse shape changes affect TOA estimates using both analytical and simulation methods on pulse shapes of varying complexity (multiple components). These methods can provide the means for improving arrival time precision for many applications, including gravitational wave astronomy using pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Investigating Polarization characteristics of GRB200503A and GRB201009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of a comprehensive analysis of the polarization characteristics of GRB 200503A and GRB 201009A observed with the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) on board AstroSat. Despite these GRBs being reasonably bright, they were missed by several spacecraft and had thus far not been localized well, hindering polarization analysis. We present positions of these bursts obtained from the Inter-Planetary Network (IPN) and the newly developed CZTI localization pipeline. We then undertook polarization analyses using the standard CZTI pipeline. We cannot constrain the polarization properties for GRB 200503A, but find that GRB 201009A has a high degree of polarization.</description>

      <title>Probing magneto-ionic microstructure towards the Vela pulsar using a prototype SKA-Low station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vela pulsar (J0835-4510) is known to exhibit variations in Faraday rotation and dispersion on multi-decade timescales due to the changing sightline through the surrounding Vela supernova remnant and the Gum Nebula. Until now, variations in Faraday rotation towards Vela have not been studied on timescales less than around a decade. We present the results of a high-cadence observing campaign carried out with the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2), a prototype SKA-Low station, which received a significant bandwidth upgrade in 2022. We collected observations of the Vela pulsar and PSR J0630-2834 (a nearby pulsar located outside the Gum Nebula), spanning $\sim 1\,\mathrm{yr}$ and $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{yr}$ respectively, and searched for linear trends in the rotation measure (RM) as a function of time. We do not detect any significant trends on this timescale ($\sim$months) for either pulsar, but the constraints could be greatly improved with more accurate ionospheric models. For the Vela pulsar, the combination of our data and historical data from the published literature have enabled us to model long-term correlated trends in RM and dispersion measure (DM) over the past two decades. We detect a change in DM of $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ which corresponds to a change in electron density of $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ on a transverse length scale of $\sim$1-2 au. The apparent magnetic field strength in the time-varying region changes from $240^{+30}_{-20}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ to $-6.2^{+0.7}_{-0.9}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ over the time span of the data set. As well as providing an important validation of polarimetry, this work highlights the pulsar monitoring capabilities of SKA-Low stations, and the niche science opportunities they offer for high-precision polarimetry and probing the microstructure of the magneto-ionic interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 2000$ days.</description>

      <title>A Fast Radio Burst monitor with a Compact All-Sky Phased Array (CASPA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients that occur at random times in host galaxies distributed all over the sky. Large field of view instruments can play a critical role in the blind search for rare FRBs. We present a concept for an all-sky FRB monitor using a compact all-sky phased array (CASPA), which can efficiently achieve an extremely large field of view of $\sim10^4$ square degrees. Such a system would allow us to conduct a continuous, blind FRB search covering the entire southern sky. Using the measured FRB luminosity function, we investigate the detection rate for this all-sky phased array and compare the result to a number of other proposed large field-of-view instruments. We predict a rate of a few FRB detections per week and determine the dispersion measure and redshift distributions of these detectable FRBs. This instrument is optimal for detecting FRBs in the nearby Universe and for extending the high-end of the FRB luminosity function through finding ultraluminous events. Additionally, this instrument can be used to shadow the new gravitational-wave observing runs, detect high energy events triggered from Galactic magnetars and search for other bright, but currently unknown transient signals.</description>

      <title>Optimal Attitude Control of Large Flexible Space Structures with Distributed Momentum Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent spacecraft mission concepts propose larger payloads that have lighter, less rigid structures. For large lightweight structures, the natural frequencies of their vibration modes may fall within the attitude controller bandwidth, threatening the stability and settling time of the controller and compromising performance. This work tackles this issue by proposing an attitude control design paradigm of distributing momentum actuators throughout the structure to have more control authority over vibration modes. The issue of jitter disturbances introduced by these actuators is addressed by expanding the bandwidth of the attitude controller to suppress excess vibrations. Numerical simulation results show that, at the expense of more control action, a distributed configuration can achieve lower settling times and reduce structural deformation compared to a more standard centralized configuration.</description>

Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>
