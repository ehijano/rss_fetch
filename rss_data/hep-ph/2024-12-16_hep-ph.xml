      <title>Probing Millicharged Particles at an Electron Beam Dump with Ultralow-Threshold Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to search for millicharged particles produced in high-intensity electron beam dumps using small ultralow-threshold sensors. As a concrete example, we consider a Skipper-CCD placed behind the beam dump in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. We compute the millicharged particle flux, including both electromagnetic cascade and meson productions emanating from an aluminum target. We find that the sensitivity of a modest 2x14 array of Skipper-CCDs can exceed the sensitivity of all existing searches for millicharged particle masses below 1.5 GeV, and is either competitive or world leading when compared to other proposed experiments. Our results demonstrate that small-scale ultralow threshold silicon devices can enhance the reach of accelerator-based experiments, while fitting comfortably within existing experimental halls.</description>

      <title>Quantum stresses in the hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational form factors are often interpreted as providing access to stresses inside hadrons, in particular through Fourier transforms of the form factors $D$ and $\bar{c}$. Some researchers, however, have expressed skepticism of this interpretation. I revisit the question, and argue that it is indeed appropriate to interpret these quantities as stress distributions. I consider the hydrogen atom's ground state as a familiar example, and use the pilot wave interpretation of quantum mechanics to give the distributions a clear meaning. A striking result is that $\bar{c}$ -- rather than $D$ -- quantifies the force law binding the system, which can be understood through Cauchy's first law of motion.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation group evolution effects on global SMEFT analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global analyses in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework serve as a tool to probe potential directions of new physics. To break degeneracies between the Wilson coefficients of the SMEFT, it is essential to combine observables from various experiments. Since different observables entering global fits may be measured at different energy scales, it becomes increasingly important to account for this fact through the renormalisation group evolution (RGE) of the Wilson coefficients. In this work, we investigate the effects of the RGE on a global SMEFT fit under the assumption of a $U(3)^5$ symmetry within the minimal flavour violation framework. We comment on the role of next-to-leading order SMEFT predictions for breaking potential degeneracies between Wilson coefficients arising as a result of RGE effects.</description>

      <title>Higgs Potential from Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the Higgs potential, a key element in our understanding of Nature, is partially generated by the instantons of new confining dynamics, perhaps from a hidden sector. In this picture, while the Higgs itself is a fundamental field, it controls the strength of the non-perturbative interactions that give rise to its potential. We examine a simple setup in which this instanton contribution is augmented by a quartic term, which is sufficient for a realistic electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The minimum of the potential is given by the Lambert $W_0$ function, with these assumptions. We discuss the predictions of this model and how it may be tested through measurements of the Higgs self coupling. Given the connection with non-trivial dynamics, one may also consider the prospects of accessing hidden sector states at colliders; this seems to be typically challenging in our setup. Symmetry restoration in the early Universe in this scenario is briefly examined. We also comment on the possible connection of our general setup with recent work on the physics of field space end points.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of ALPs from $B$-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion-like particles (ALPs) through flavor changing neutral current processes, such as $B\to K a$ followed by hadronic decays. Our generic framework encompasses different ultraviolet scenarios similar to KSVZ, DFSZ and Flaxion etc. Starting from the effective Lagrangian written at the high scale, we compute the anomalous dimension matrix, taking into account all one-loop and relevant two-loop contributions. The latter is most important for the KSVZ and heavy QCD axion scenarios. We recognized that such two-loop diagrams can have both ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) divergences. We show explicitly that UV divergences cancel by inserting appropriate counterterms, which are new operators involving the axion field and required to be present at the UV itself, to renormalize the theory. On the other hand, the cancellation of IR divergences is subtle and demonstrated through matching with the effective theory at the electroweak scale. We also utilize chiral perturbation theory and vector meson dominance framework to compute the decay and branching fractions of the ALP pertaining to our framework. We find that for KSVZ-like scenario, axion decay constant, $f_a \lesssim 1$ TeV can be ruled out. The bound becomes stronger for the DFSZ and Flaxion-like models, reaching upto $10^2$ TeV and $10^3$ TeV respectively. We also provide projections on the parameter space based on 3 ab$^{-1}$ data from Belle II.</description>

      <title>Vector Portals at Future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to weakly coupled vector dark portals (aka ``$ Z' $ bosons'') with masses ranging from tens of GeV to a few TeV. Our analysis focuses on dark photons and $ L_{\mu} - L_{\tau} $ gauge bosons. We consider both visible and invisible decay channels. We demonstrate that both high energy $\mu$ colliders and future $ e^+e^- $ colliders, using the FCC-ee $Z$-pole and $ZH$ operation modes as a benchmark, offer significant improvements in sensitivity. We find that both colliders can enhance the sensitivity to $ L_{\mu} - L_{\tau} $ bosons (for both visible and invisible decays) and to invisibly decaying dark photons by 1--2 orders of magnitude across the relevant mass range. Furthermore, we study the impact of forward $ \mu $ detectors at the $ \mu $-collider on the sensitivity to both models.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of boosted dark matter in two component dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of boosted dark matter in a two component dark matter model with the hidden gauge $U(1)_D$ symmetry. The model introduces heavy and light fermionic dark matter components, where the heavy dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center boosts the light dark matter. Directional direct detection experiments, such as NEWSdm, are suitable for testing the boosted scenario by focusing on signals from the Galactic center. We found that the expected event rate could reach up to O(10) events per year per 5 kg of the detector material.</description>

      <title>In-medium electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons from the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the modifications of hadron structure in a nuclear medium, focusing on the spacelike electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) of light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. By combining the light-front quark model (LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces EMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter, respectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of mesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level.</description>

      <title>Searching for neutral state in the rare decay $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+ e^- \phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay process $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+ e^-\phi$, where the relatively clean electromagnetic (EM) transitions dominate at leading order at the tree level, while hadronic contributions arise only through hadronic loop transitions. The branching ratio of $J/\psi \rightarrow e^+ e^-\phi$ was estimated to be approximately $2.28 \times 10^{-8}$ keV where the hadronic effects are negligible compared to the EM contributions. The upper limit on the branching fraction was set to be $B(J/\psi \rightarrow e^+ e^-\phi) &lt; 1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ by BESIII collaboration. In this paper we investigate the existence of a neutral state such as dark photon and dark $Z$. Our analysis shows that the constraints on the dark photon and dark $Z$ are stringent in the way that large enhancement to the SM branching ratio up to the present experimental limit is not possible. Therefore, observing a signal for the dark photon and dark $Z$ in this decay channel is changeable.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced neutron, proton and alpha evaporation from heavy nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb nuclei are excited through interactions induced by strong electromagnetic fields. The expected excitation energy could reach hundreds MeV, which leads to the subsequent emission of various particles, including neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. To accurately describe deexcitation of nuclei, we have developed two novel approaches. The first method utilizes the Heavy Ion Phase Space Exploration (HIPSE) model to simulate pre-equilibrium emissions and to estimate the excitation energy of the remaining nucleus. Our second approach introduces a new technique for modeling the excitation energy of the nucleus. This method consists of a two-component function to represent the excitation energy distribution more precisely, accounting for the energy loss due to the interaction between photons and quasi-deuteron. Both of these modeling techniques are integrated with the results produced by the GEMINI++ generator, which implements the Hauser-Feshbach formalism to simulate the statistical decay of excited nuclei. The alternative calculations are done with EMPIRE platform. Using these approaches, we obtained the cross sections for the emission of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles resulting from UPC at the LHC. Our results were compared with the experimental data of the ALICE group on neutron and proton multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Two portals to GeV sterile neutrinos : dipole versus mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive sterile neutrinos, also known as heavy neutral leptons, can have a mixing with active neutrinos, $\theta$, as well as a dipole coupling to the photon, $d$. We study the interplay between these two portals, considering the production from meson decays of sterile neutrinos with mass $0.1$ GeV $\lesssim M_N \lesssim 10$ GeV, at beam-dump facilities such as NA62 and SHiP, and at the FASER2 experiment. These sterile neutrinos can be long-lived and decay into a photon in a distant detector, via the dipole operator. We find that all these experiments will be sensitive to values of $d$ which are presently unconstrained. The experimental reach varies strongly with the mass $M_N$ and the mixing $\theta$, and one observes specific correlations with the flavour of active neutrinos. The SHiP experiment will mark a jump in sensitivity, as it will probe dipole couplings as small as $d\sim 10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$, thus testing new physics well above the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>The bremsstrahlung-like production of the massive spin-2 dark matter mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between Standard Model (SM) particles and dark matter (DM) can be introduced via spin-2 massive mediator, G, that couples to photon and charged leptons. Moreover, in a mediator mass range from sub-MeV to sub-GeV, fixed-target facilities such as NA64e, LDMX, NA64$\mu$, M$^3$, and E137, can potentially probe such particle of the hidden sector via the signatures that are described by the bremsstrahlung-like process involving tensor mediator. We compare numerically the Weizsaker-Williams (WW) approximation and the exact tree-level (ETL) approach for the bremsstrahlung-like mediator production cross section by choosing various parameters of the fixed-target experiments. In addition, we derive novel constraints on spin-2 DM mediator parameter space from the data of the E137 fixed-target experiment. In particular, we demonstrate that the E137 experiment has been ruled out the the couplings of the spin-2 mediator at the level of $8\times10^{-8}~\mbox{GeV}^{-1}~\lesssim~c^{\rm G}_{ee}~\lesssim~10^{-5}~\mbox{GeV}^{-1}$ for the typical masses in the range $100~\mbox{MeV}~\lesssim~m_{\rm G}~\lesssim 800~\mbox{MeV}$, that corresponds to the statistics of $1.87\times 10^{20}$ electrons accumulated on target. The latter implies its universal coupling to photons and leptons, $c^{\rm G}_{ee} = c^{\rm G}_{\gamma \gamma}$.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter from level crossing with refined adiabatic condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the level-crossing phenomenon in two-axion systems, where the mass eigenvalues intersect as the mass of one axion increases with the cooling of the universe. This phenomenon can significantly alter the abundance of axions in the early universe. Our study focuses on its impact on the QCD axion and an axion-like particle, identifying viable regions of axion mass and decay constant that explain the observed dark matter. We demonstrate the equivalence of two different bases for describing the axion system in the existing literature. Furthermore, we derive an improved expression for the adiabatic condition that overcomes limitations in earlier formulations. This new formulation is basis-independent, and we numerically validate its effectiveness. Our analysis reveals specific relations between axion masses and axion-photon couplings within the viable region. These relations could potentially serve as a smoking gun signal for this scenario if confirmed experimentally. We also find that, using the chiral perturbation model, the thermal friction on the QCD axion might be significantly larger than previously estimated. Additionally, we show that a simple model with axion mixing can naturally realize either a heavier or lighter QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Low-scale seesaw with flavour and CP symmetries $\unicode{x2013}$ from colliders to leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos, endowed with a flavour symmetry $G_f$, $G_f=\Delta (3 \, n^2)$ or $G_f=\Delta (6 \, n^2)$, $n \geq 2$, and CP. For large active-sterile mixing, we study the properties of the (nearly mass-degenerate) heavy neutrinos, such as their lifetimes and branching ratios. In doing so, we examine the four different cases, called Case 1) through Case 3 b.1), that lead to distinct lepton mixing patterns, all potentially compatible with current data. Furthermore, we comprehensively explore for each case the region of parameter space in which a sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be generated via leptogenesis, while being testable at accelerator-based and potentially also precision flavour experiments.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effective couplings in the top-Higgs sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe requires new sources of charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) violation beyond those in the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects in the top-Higgs sector using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Focusing on top-pair production in association with a Higgs boson and single top-Higgs associated production at the LHC, we study $\mathcal{CP}$ violation in the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling and other Higgs and top interactions entering these processes. By analysing $\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive differential observables and asymmetries, we provide direct constraints on $\mathcal{CP}$-violating interactions in the top-Higgs sector. Our analysis demonstrates how combining $t\bar{t}h$ and $thj$ production can disentangle the real and imaginary components of the top-Yukawa coupling, offering valuable insights into potential sources of $\mathcal{CP}$ violation. The sensitivity of these observables to SMEFT operators provides model-independent constraints on the parameter space, advancing the search for new physics in the top-Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Portal Dark Matter Detection Prospects at a Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With no concrete evidence for non-gravitational interactions of dark matter to date, it is natural to wonder whether dark matter couples predominantly to the Standard Model (SM)'s neutrinos. Neutrino interactions (and the possible existence of additional neutrinophilic mediators) are substantially less understood than those of other SM particles, yet this picture will change dramatically in the coming decades with new neutrino sources. One potential new source arises with the construction of a high-energy muon collider (MuCol) -- due to muons' instability, a MuCol is a source of high-energy collimated neutrinos. Importantly, since the physics of muon decays (into neutrinos) is very well-understood, this leads to a neutrino flux with systematic uncertainties far smaller than fluxes from conventional high-energy (proton-sourced) neutrino beams. In this work, we study the capabilities of a potential neutrino detector, "MuCol$\nu$," placed ${\sim}$100 m downstream of the MuCol interaction point. The MuCol$\nu$ detector would be especially capable of searching for a neutrinophilic mediator $\phi$ through the mono-neutrino scattering process $\nu_\mu N \to \mu^+ \phi X$, exceeding searches from other terrestrial approaches for $m_\phi$ in the ${\sim}$few MeV -- ten GeV range. Even with a $10$ kg-yr exposure, MuCol$\nu$ is capable of searching for well-motivated classes of thermal freeze-out and freeze-in neutrino-portal dark matter.</description>

      <title>Towards a foundation model for heavy-ion collision experiments through point cloud diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of Asymmetry Generation in Fermion-Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform real-time simulation of fermion-bubble scattering during a first order phase transition by which the fermions become massive. This out-of-equilibrium dynamics can generate a CP asymmetry, which is a crucial ingredient for baryon asymmetry generation in the early Universe. As a prototype, we consider a 1+1-dimensional system, for which CP is replaced by charge conjugation C. We use tensor network methods to study the C asymmetry generation outside the bubble wall induced by a complex fermion mass profile. In the asymptotic region, where reflected particles are far from the scattering point, our lattice calculations are in good agreement with perturbative calculations, but are also applicable in the nonpertubative regime. Real-time evolution of the instantaneous asymmetry generation near the collision point is also accessible within our framework and can be an order of magnitude larger than the asymptotic value. This intriguing feature may have far-reaching consequences in a full model calculation of electroweak baryogenesis. Our studies provide a necessary step for guiding quantum simulations of early universe phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Betwixt Annihilation and Decay: The Hidden Structure of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stasis is a unique cosmological phenomenon in which the abundances of different energy components in the universe (such as matter, radiation, and vacuum energy) each remain fixed even though they scale differently under cosmological expansion. Moreover, extended epochs exhibiting stasis are generally cosmological attractors in many BSM settings and thus arise naturally and without fine-tuning. To date, stasis has been found within a number of very different BSM cosmologies. In some cases, stasis emerges from theories that contain large towers of decaying states (such as theories in extra dimensions or string theory). By contrast, in other cases, no towers of states are needed, and stasis instead emerges due to thermal effects involving particle annihilation rather than decay. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the energy flows in all of these theories during stasis, and find that these theories all share a common energy-flow structure which in some sense lies between particle decay and particle annihilation. This structure has been hidden until now but ultimately lies at the root of the stasis phenomenon, with all of the previous stases appearing as different manifestations of this common underlying structure. This insight not only allows us to understand the emergence of stasis in each of these different scenarios, but also provides an important guide for the potential future discovery of stasis in additional cosmological systems.</description>

      <title>Effective temperatures of the QGP from thermal photon and dilepton production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal electromagnetic radiation is emitted by the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout its space-time evolution, with production rates that depend characteristically on the temperature. We study this temperature using thermal photons and dileptons using the Trajectum heavy ion code, which is constrained by Bayesian analysis. In addition we present the elliptic flow of both the thermal photons and thermal dileptons including systematic uncertainties corresponding to the model parameter uncertainty. We give a comprehensive overview of the resulting effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$, obtained from thermal photon transverse momentum and thermal dilepton invariant mass distributions, as well as the dependence of $T_{\rm eff}$ on various selection criteria of these probes. We conclude that the $T_{\rm eff}$ obtained from thermal photons is mostly insensitive to the temperature of the QGP with a value of $T_{\rm eff} \sim$ 250-300 MeV depending on their transverse momentum, almost independent of collision centrality. Thermal dileptons are much better probes of the QGP temperature as they do not suffer from a blue shift as their invariant mass is used, allowing for a more precise constraint of the QGP temperature during different stages of the evolution of the system. By applying selection criteria on the dilepton transverse momentum and the invariant mass we are able to extract fluid temperatures on average times ranging from late emission ($\langle \tau \rangle = 5.6\,$fm$/c$) to very early emissions ($\langle \tau \rangle &lt; 1.0\,$fm$/c$). Furthermore, we show how these selection criteria can be used to map the elliptic flow of the system all throughout its evolution.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT violation and the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extremely narrow natural linewidths of rovibrational energy levels in the molecular hydrogen ion $\textrm{H}_2^{\,+}$, and the prospect of synthesising its antimatter counterpart $\overline{\textrm{H}}_2^{\,-}$, make it a promising candidate for high-precision tests of fundamental symmetries such as Lorentz and CPT invariance. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the rovibrational spectrum of the (anti-)hydrogen molecular ion in a low-energy effective theory incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. The focus is on the spin-independent couplings in this theory, for which the best current bounds come from measurements of the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen. We show that in addition to the improvement in these bounds from the increased precision of the transition frequencies, potentially reaching 1 part in $10^{17}$, rovibrational transitions have an enhanced sensitivity to Lorentz and CPT violation of $O(m_p/m_e)$ in the proton (hadron) sector compared to atomic transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With no direct evidence for new physics at the TeV scale, deviations from the Standard Model (SM) can be explored systematically through Effective Field Theories (EFTs) such as the Standard Model EFT (SMEFT). SMEFT extends the SM by introducing higher-dimensional operators parametrized by Wilson coefficients, offering a framework to probe beyond the SM (BSM) effects. This contribution highlights three recent analyses using the ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Combined measurements improve the sensitivity to Wilson coefficients by reducing degeneracies and tightening constraints, exploring the potential of SMEFT in the top quark sector.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived dark scalars at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the search for long-lived dark scalars from exotic Higgs boson decays at the Future Circular Collider in its $e^+e^-$ stage, FCC-ee, considering an integrated luminosity of 10.8 $\text{ab}^{-1}$ collected during the ZH run at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV. The work considers $Zh$ events where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson $h$ decays into two long-lived dark scalars $s$ which further decay into bottom anti-bottom quark pairs. The analysis is performed using a parametrized simulation of the IDEA detector concept and targets dark scalar decays in the tracking volume, resulting in multiple displaced vertices in the final state. The sensitivity towards long-lived dark scalars at FCC-ee is estimated using an event selection requiring two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons compatible with the $Z$ boson, and at least two displaced vertices in the final state. The selection is seen to efficiently remove the Standard Model background, while retaining sensitivity for dark scalar masses between $m_s=20$ GeV and $m_s=60$ GeV and mean proper lifetimes $c\tau$ between approximately 10 mm and 10 m The results show that the search strategy has potential to probe Higgs to dark scalar branching ratios as low as $10^{-4}$ for a mean proper lifetime $c\tau\approx 1$ m. The results provide the first sensitivity estimate for exotic Higgs decays at FCC-ee with the IDEA detector concept, using the common FCC framework.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Theorem at work: manifestly gauge-invariant Abelian Higgs model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the Equivalence Theorem from an algebraic viewpoint, using an extended BRST symmetry. This version of the Equivalence Theorem is then used to reexpress the Abelian Higgs model action, originally written in terms of undesirable gauge variant field excitations, in terms of gauge-invariant, physical variables, corresponding to the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi composite operators in the original field formulation. Although the ensuing action encompasses an infinite number of vertices and appears to be nonrenormalizable from the powercounting viewpoint, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to the hidden equivalence with the original model. Hence, manifestly gauge-invariant computations are possible. We present an explicit illustration in terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and corresponding pole mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering (euclidean) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ using a spherical background. Usually, this calculation is performed resorting to proper-time regularization within the heat kernel expansion and gives rise to quartically and quadratically UV-sensitive contributions to the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac}=\frac{\Lambda_{\rm cc}}{8\pi G}$, with $\Lambda_{\rm cc}$ and $G$ cosmological and Newton constant, respectively. We show that, if the measure in the path integral that defines $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ is correctly taken into account, and the physical UV cutoff $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ properly introduced, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$. We also consider a free scalar field and a free Dirac field on a spherical gravitational background, and find that the same holds true even in the presence of matter. These results are found without resorting to any supersymmetric embedding of the theory, and shed new light on the cosmological constant problem.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of modulated positron bunch formed in crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar channeling of the positrons of a bunch taking into account medium polarization is considered, which entails it's radiation at both soft and hard photons at a zero angle. Spatially uniphase charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. This phenomenon can only occur in microundulators with account of the polarization. The crystalline undulator (CU) parameters (the spatial period and the amplitude) are chosen to preserve the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CU radiation (CUR) from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation hinges on the modulation depth of a microbunch. The latter, an important parameter of a bunch, will also be possible to determine as a result of the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific scenario involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE FEL process at the wavelength corresponding to the SASE FEL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study realistic models predicting primordial black hole (PBH) formation from density fluctuations generated in a first-order phase transition. We show that the second-order correction in the expansion of the bubble nucleation rate is necessary for accurate predictions and quantify its impact on the abundance of PBHs and gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the distribution of the fluctuations becomes more Gaussian as the second-order term increases. Consequently, models that predict the same PBH abundances can produce different GW spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homogeneous precession domain (HPD) of superfluid $^{3}$He has recently been identified as a detection medium which might provide sensitivity to the axion-nucleon coupling $g_{aNN}$ competitive with, or surpassing, existing experimental proposals. In this work, we make a detailed study of the statistical and dynamical properties of the HPD system in order to make realistic projections for a full-fledged experimental program. We include the effects of clock error and measurement error in a concrete readout scheme using superconducting qubits and quantum metrology. This work also provides a more general framework to describe the statistics associated with the axion gradient coupling through the treatment of a transient resonance with a non-stationary background in a time-series analysis. Incorporating an optimal data-taking and analysis strategy, we project a sensitivity approaching $g_{aNN} \sim 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ across a decade in axion mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the Standard Model vacuum, and investigate its quantum effective potential using the highest available orders in perturbation theory and the most accurate determination of input parameters to date. We observe that the stability of the electroweak vacuum centrally depends on the values of the top mass and the strong coupling constant. We estimate that reducing their uncertainties by a factor of two to three is sufficient to establish or refute SM vacuum stability at the $5\sigma$ level. We further investigate vacuum stability for a variety of singlet scalar field extensions with and without flavor using the Higgs portal mechanism. We identify the BSM parameter spaces for stability and find sizable room for new physics. We further study the phenomenology of Planck-safe models at colliders, and determine the impact on the Higgs trilinear, the Higgs-to-electroweak-boson, and the Higgs quartic couplings, some of which can be significant. The former two can be probed at the HL-LHC, the latter requires a future collider with sufficient energy and precision such as the FCC-hh.</description>

Abstract: The low-mass dark matter (DM) such as axion or wavelike scalar is a plausible DM candidate. Recently, the possible non-standard couplings of low-mass DM has drawn much attention. In this work we investigate the detection of electromagnetic couplings in a few benchmark models of low-mass DM. For illustration, we consider the generic axion electrodynamics including CP violating coupling as well as the newly proposed axion electromagnetodynamics. The superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity with two modes has more advantages than the traditional cavity approach with static background field. We utilize the two-mode SRF cavity to probe the generic couplings of low-mass DM with frequency lower than GHz. We show the sensitivity of the SRF cavity to the axion couplings in the above frameworks.</description>

      <title>Parity and lepton masses in the left-right symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral symmetry that protects the electron's mass ($m_e$), due to parity (P), implies in the symmetry limit the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break the chiral symmetry softly (or spontaneously if it is gauged) to generate the observed large neutrino mixing angles at the tree-level. The electron then acquires its mass on renormalization group equation (RGE) running due to its neutrino's mixing, and in turn determines the $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking scale ($v_R$) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV.$ If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the $B-L$ breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of the high scale of $v_R$, this is a testable model since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with $0$ or $180^o$ to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on $\delta_{CP}$.</description>

      <title>Transition magnetic moment about neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}^M/\mu_B$ is around $10^{-20}$ $\sim$ $10^{-19}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Collision Energy Dependence of Particle Ratios and Freeze-out Parameters in Ultra Relativistic Nucleus Nucleus Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the thermo-chemical freeze-out condition of the multi-component hot and dense hadron resonance gas (HRG) formed in the ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions (URNNC). The van der Waals (VDW) type model used in the present analysis incorporates the repulsive as well as attractive interactions among the hadrons. The baryons (antibaryons) are treated as incompressible objects. Using this theoretical approach the values of the model freeze-out parameters of the system are extracted over a wide range of collision energy by analyzing experimental data on like-mass antibaryon to baryon ratios. The same set of parameters is found to explain the energy dependence of several other particle ratios quite satisfactorily. We find that the horn-like structures seen in the ratios of strange particles to pions as a function of the collision energy cannot be explained by the VDW-HRG model alone without considering the strangeness imbalance effect in the system. We have compared our freeze-out line with those obtained earlier. The correlation between the $\bar{p}/p$ and $K^-/K^+$ ratios is also examined.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule analysis of $0^{+}$ four-quark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive QCD sum rules analysis at next-to-leading order for all types of $J^P=0^{+}$ four-quark states composed of $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. The eigenvectors of the renormalization matrix are chosen to be the renormalized four-quark operators, which can be equally interpreted as tetraquark or molecule operators. Meanwhile, the typical nonet masses given by bare tetraquark operators are lower than those given by bare molecule operators. Most of the nonet masses are around $1-2\text{GeV}$, and they can be interpreted as the $0^+$ mesons observed in experiments. We find a category of four-quark nonets with masses $\lesssim1\text{GeV}$, potentially corresponding to the light $0^+$ mesons $f_0(500)$, $K^*_0(700)$, $f_0(980)$, and $a_0(980)$. On the other hand, the possible 27-fold states are heavier than most of the nonets, with masses $\gtrsim 2\text{GeV}$. The main uncertainty arises from the factorization of high-dimensional condensates, which usually underestimates their values. To address this, we introduce deviation factors for the dimension-6, -8, and -10 condensates, and vary them over a wide range to obtain conservative estimates of the $0^+$ four-quark state masses. Some general properties of the $0^+$ light four-quark states can be derived that do not rely on precise numerical values. We also find that the ambiguity in the factorization of the dimension-8 condensate can introduce a larger discrepancy than previously estimated. As a byproduct, we propose a simple trick for renormalizing multi-quark operators at the one-loop level.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in primordial power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the "double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large in the setup where the transition from the intermediate USR to the final slow-roll phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass effects in the Energy-Energy Correlation in the back-to-back region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heavy quark mass ($m$) effects in the Energy-Energy Correlation function in $e^+e^- \to hadrons$ at high energy $Q$, in the back-to-back (two-jet) region. In the ultra-relativistic limit, $Q \gg m$, the QCD Sudakov form factor $S(b)$ in impact parameter ($b$-)space reads: \begin{eqnarray} \log S(b) &amp;=&amp; - \int_{m^2}^{Q^2} \frac{dk^2}{k^2} \left\{ \log\left(\frac{Q^2}{k^2}\right) A[\alpha_S(k^2)] + B[\alpha_S(k^2)]\right\} [1-J_0(b k)] \nonumber\\ &amp;&amp; - \int_0^{m^2} \frac{dk^2}{k^2} \left\{ \log\left(\frac{Q^2}{m^2}\right) A[\alpha_S(k^2)] + D[\alpha_S(k^2)] \right\} [1-J_0(b k)]. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} The double-log function $A(\alpha_S)$ describes the effects of soft gluons, quasi-collinear to the original quark-antiquark pair, while the single-log functions $B(\alpha_S)$ and $D(\alpha_S)$ describe hard collinear radiation and soft radiation not log-collinearly enhanced, respectively. The usual logarithmic expansion of the low transverse momenta contribution to the form factor ($k^2&lt;m^2$) involves two new function series. An explicit evaluation of the heavy quark form factor at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic accuracy is presented. The relation of our results with the well-known (classical) dead-cone effect in gauge theories is analyzed. At Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, an improved formula for the dead cone is proposed; the soft term produces an increase of the dead-cone opening angle of a factor $\sqrt{e} \simeq 1.64872$. However, beyond NLL, a physical interpretation of this kind breaks down. The generalization of the above formula to the resummation of shape variables in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, or to the resummation of the transverse momentum distributions in hadron collisions, is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino mass ordering with supernova neutrinos at NO$\nu$A including the effect of sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of probing the mass ordering sensitivity as a function of supernova distance in the context of the ongoing neutrino experiment NO$\nu$A. We provide a detailed study of the active-active and active-sterile mixing frameworks, illustrating how supernova neutrinos can be used to realize the existence of sterile neutrinos. Interestingly, we infer that observation of the NC channel alone can differentiate between the presence and absence of sterile neutrinos. Our results indicate that the primary channel of NO$\nu$A can distinguish normal mass hierarchy from inverted mass hierarchy at $5 \sigma$ confidence level for a supernova explosion occurring at a distance of 5 kpc. Additionally, we examine the impact of systematic uncertainties on mass hierarchy sensitivity, showing that higher levels of systematics lead to a reduction in sensitivity. Similarly, the inclusion of energy smearing significantly diminishes hierarchy sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>High gradient twin $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ linear colliders with energy recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a high energy superconducting (SC) \epem linear collider (LC) with energy recovery (ERLC) has been proposed where twin RF structures are used to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider could operate in a DC (duty cycle) or CW (continuous) modes, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=250-500$ GeV. In this paper, it is noted that the luminosity in the ERLC is independent of the accelerating gradient (at the same total power). Therefore, the ERLC could operate at maximum available accelerating gradients. This paper considers for the first time an $e^-e^-$ twin collider with ER and estimates its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is much simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one because beam recirculation is not needed. Travelling wave RF structures allow for higher gradients and reduced heat load. It is shown that an ERLC with accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m could operate in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1 -- 2.5)$\times 10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3 -- 7)$\times 10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable powers of 150 and 300 MW for $2E_0=250$ and $2E_0=500$ GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star binaries and their associated gravitational wave signal facilitate precision tests of General Relativity. Any deviation of the detected gravitational waveform from General Relativity would therefore be a smoking gun signature of new physics, in the form of additional forces, dark matter particles, or extra gravitational degrees of freedom. To be able to probe new theories, precise knowledge of the expected waveform is required. In our work, we consider a generic setup by augmenting General Relativity with an additional, massive scalar field. We then compute the inspiral dynamics of a binary system, for circular orbits, by employing an effective field theoretical approach, while giving a detailed introduction to the computational framework. Finally, we derive the modified TaylorF2 phase of the gravitational wave signal at next-to-leading order in the post-Newtonian expansion, and leading order in the parameters of the scalar sector, such as the scalar charge. As a consequence of our model-agnostic approach, our results are readily adaptable to a plethora of new physics scenarios, including modified gravity theories and scalar dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08866</link>

Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose a conceptual design for an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering, and we provide the requirements on the beam spectrum and reducible backgrounds such that a detection may be achieved. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <title>Updating neutrino mass constraints with Background measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\Omega_{\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\sum m_\nu &lt;0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently. The tightest bound we find here is $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.043$~eV at $2\sigma$ after combining Cosmic Microwave Background Planck data with DESI BAO, Supernovae Ia, GRBs, cosmic chronometers, and galaxy clusters, showing a clear tension between neutrino oscillation results and cosmological analyses. In general, removing either one of the two background probes still provides a limit $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$~eV, reassuring the enormous potential of these low-redshift observations in constraining the neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on a Pixelated Universe in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is able to accommodate the data, providing a marginally better fit than $\Lambda$CDM; and we show that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today could provide better fits. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary heavy-ion physics research aims to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray deuteron excess from a primary component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent AMS-02 measurements of cosmic-ray (CR) deuteron fluxes suggest the presence of primary deuterons in quantities far exceeding predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This poses a significant challenge to modern astrophysics, as no known processes can account for such large amounts of deuterons without violating existing constraints~\cite{Epstein:1976hq}. In contrast, it is recently proposed that the AMS-02 measurements can be explained by a purely secondary origin when contributions from heavier nuclei are considered. In this study, we recalculate the secondary deuteron flux using production cross sections updated with the latest collider data. We find that some of the deuteron production cross sections are overestimated in the widely-used calculation tools for CR propagation, and a primary deuteron component is still necessary. We then propose a novel process for generating primary deuterons at CR sources through a fusion mechanism, which is naturally unique to deuterons. This model could explain the observed deuteron excess while maintaining consistency with other CR measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>
