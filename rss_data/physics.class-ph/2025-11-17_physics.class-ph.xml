      <title>Non-Gaussianity-induced enhanced target-finding dynamics of confined colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The encounter of diffusing entities underlies a wide range of natural phenomena. The dynamics of these first-passage processes are strongly influenced by the geometry of the system, for example through confining boundaries. Confinement, which alters the diffusion of microscopic particles through both conservative and hydrodynamic interactions, emerges as a key ingredient for modeling realistic environments. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of confinement on the first-passage statistics of a diffusing particle. This diffusive motion is probed, with nanometric precision, by combining \textit{state-of-the-art} holographic microscopy with advanced statistical inference methods. Our experimental and numerical results provide a comprehensive understanding of this process, which is governed by the coupling between gravitational, screened electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, as well as thermal fluctuations. We further show that confinement can either slow down or enhance the typical first-passage kinetics, depending on the experimental parameters and considered direction of space. In particular, the observed boost in wall-normal target-finding efficiency appears to be a direct consequence of the non-Gaussian displacement distribution induced by the near-surface effects, and the associated increased probability of large displacements. As the latter are rare events, our findings may be of relevance to rationalize confined chemical reactions, or biological \textit{winners-take-all} stochastic processes near boundaries.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is crucial for the development of powerful ultrashort light sources. We present a mechanism for generating CSR in the form of generalised superradiance, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density inner surface of a microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons to emit CSR in the Vavilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry of these electrons, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions in the form of isolated harmonics, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission. The challenges to experimentally realise this scheme are discussed, including the need for high-contrast lasers to prevent pre-plasma formation and the demanding tolerances for microtube fabrication and alignment, while these challenges are not beyond the scope of existing or near-future experimental capabilities.</description>
