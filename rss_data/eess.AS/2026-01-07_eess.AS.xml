      <title>Vclip: Face-based Speaker Generation by Face-voice Association Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the task of face-based speech synthesis, a kind of personalized speech synthesis where the synthesized voices are con- strained to perceptually match with a reference face image. Due to the lack of TTS-quality audio-visual corpora, previous approaches suffer from either low synthesis quality or domain mismatch induced by a knowledge transfer scheme. This paper proposes a new approach called Vclip that utilizes the facial-semantic knowledge of the CLIP encoder on noisy audio-visual data to learn the association between face and voice efficiently, achieving 89.63% cross-modal verification AUC score on Voxceleb testset. The proposed method then uses a retrieval-based strategy, combined with GMM-based speaker generation module for a downstream TTS system, to produce probable target speakers given reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Vclip system in conjunction with the retrieval step can bridge the gap between face and voice features for face-based speech synthesis. And using the feedback information distilled from downstream TTS helps to synthesize voices that match closely with reference faces. Demos available at sos1sos2sixteen.github.io/vclip.</description>

      <title>XLSR-MamBo: Scaling the Hybrid Mamba-Attention Backbone for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced speech synthesis technologies have enabled highly realistic speech generation, posing security risks that motivate research into audio deepfake detection (ADD). While state space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, pure causal SSMs architectures often struggle with the content-based retrieval required to capture global frequency-domain artifacts. To address this, we explore the scaling properties of hybrid architectures by proposing XLSR-MamBo, a modular framework integrating an XLSR front-end with synergistic Mamba-Attention backbones. We systematically evaluate four topological designs using advanced SSM variants, Mamba, Mamba2, Hydra, and Gated DeltaNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the MamBo-3-Hydra-N3 configuration achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems on the ASVspoof 2021 LA, DF, and In-the-Wild benchmarks. This performance benefits from Hydra's native bidirectional modeling, which captures holistic temporal dependencies more efficiently than the heuristic dual-branch strategies employed in prior works. Furthermore, evaluations on the DFADD dataset demonstrate robust generalization to unseen diffusion- and flow-matching-based synthesis methods. Crucially, our analysis reveals that scaling backbone depth effectively mitigates the performance variance and instability observed in shallower models. These results demonstrate the hybrid framework's ability to capture artifacts in spoofed speech signals, providing an effective method for ADD.</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-Grained and Multi-Granular Contrastive Language-Speech Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling fine-grained speaking styles remains challenging for language-speech representation pre-training, as existing speech-text models are typically trained with coarse captions or task-specific supervision, and scalable fine-grained style annotations are unavailable. We present FCaps, a large-scale dataset with fine-grained free-text style descriptions, encompassing 47k hours of speech and 19M fine-grained captions annotated via a novel end-to-end pipeline that directly grounds detailed captions in audio, thereby avoiding the error propagation caused by LLM-based rewriting in existing cascaded pipelines. Evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge demonstrate that our annotations surpass existing cascaded annotations in terms of correctness, coverage, and naturalness. Building on FCaps, we propose CLSP, a contrastive language-speech pre-trained model that integrates global and fine-grained supervision, enabling unified representations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLSP learns fine-grained and multi-granular speech-text representations that perform reliably across global and fine-grained speech-text retrieval, zero-shot paralinguistic classification, and speech style similarity scoring, with strong alignment to human judgments. All resources will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>WearVox: An Egocentric Multichannel Voice Assistant Benchmark for Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable devices such as AI glasses are transforming voice assistants into always-available, hands-free collaborators that integrate seamlessly with daily life, but they also introduce challenges like egocentric audio affected by motion and noise, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish device-directed speech from background conversations. Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Quanvolutional Neural Networks Robustness for Speech in Healthcare Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based machine learning systems are sensitive to noise, complicating reliable deployment in emotion recognition and voice pathology detection. We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base. To our knowledge, this is a systematic study of QNN robustness for speech under common non-adversarial acoustic corruptions, indicating that shallow entangling quantum front-ends can improve noise resilience while sensitivity to additive noise remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>VocalBridge: Latent Diffusion-Bridge Purification for Defeating Perturbation-Based Voiceprint Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.
  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Quantization Error Propagation in Encoder-Decoder ASR Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on memory-constrained edge devices requires efficient compression. While layer-wise post-training quantization is effective, it suffers from error accumulation, especially in encoder-decoder architectures. Existing solutions like Quantization Error Propagation (QEP) are suboptimal for ASR due to the model's heterogeneity, processing acoustic features in the encoder while generating text in the decoder. To address this, we propose Fine-grained Alpha for Dynamic Quantization Error Propagation (FADE), which adaptively controls the trade-off between cross-layer error correction and local quantization. Experiments show that FADE significantly improves stability by reducing performance variance across runs, while simultaneously surpassing baselines in mean WER.</description>

      <title>SPO-CLAPScore: Enhancing CLAP-based alignment prediction system with Standardize Preference Optimization, for the first XACLE Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first XACLE Challenge (x-to-audio alignment challenge) addresses the critical need for automatic evaluation metrics that correlate with human perception of audio-text semantic alignment. In this paper, we describe the "Takano_UTokyo_03" system submitted to XACLE Challenge. Our approach leverages a CLAPScore-based architecture integrated with a novel training method called Standardized Preference Optimization (SPO). SPO standardizes the raw alignment scores provided by each listener, enabling the model to learn relative preferences and mitigate the impact of individual scoring biases. Additionally, we employ listener screening to exclude listeners with inconsistent ratings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that both SPO and listener screening effectively improve the correlation with human judgment. Our system achieved 6th place in the challenge with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.6142, demonstrating competitive performance within a marginal gap from the top-ranked systems. The code is available at https://github.com/ttakano398/SPO-CLAPScore.</description>

      <title>MoE Adapter for Large Audio Language Models: Sparsity, Disentanglement, and Gradient-Conflict-Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Discovering and Causally Validating Emotion-Sensitive Neurons in Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion is a central dimension of spoken communication, yet, we still lack a mechanistic account of how modern large audio-language models (LALMs) encode it internally. We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Guided Decoding for Self-Supervised Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised automatic speech recognition (SSL-ASR) is an ASR approach that uses speech encoders pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled audio (e.g., wav2vec2.0 or HuBERT) and then fine-tunes them with limited labeled data to perform transcription. Decoding is usually performed with a CTC decoder, whose hypotheses are scored and refined using an external language model (LM), typically an n-gram or neural LM, which guides beam search to produce the final transcription. Using Large Language Models (LLMs) as external LMs remains a challenge, as their word probabilities are overly confident. The proposed method integrates an LLM with an SSL acoustic model by using the LLM's decoding mechanism to generate a set of candidate next tokens. For each candidate, the SSL model provides an acoustic score by aligning it to the input acoustics of the SSL model. A combined acoustic and LLM score is then calculated based on decomposing the MAP estimator of words given the acoustic signal. The tokens with the highest combined scores are maintained in a beam, which is then used to proceed to the next decoding step. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive comparison with the current state-of-the-art LLM-based decoding, post-processing, and error-correcting methods across multiple datasets. Our approach proves particularly effective when processing challenging inputs such as complex speech sentences, acronyms, and domain-specific vocabulary.</description>

      <title>TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</description>

      <title>CMDAR: A Chinese Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark with Diverse Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization</title>

Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description>
