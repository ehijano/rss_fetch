      <title>MutaPLM: Protein Language Modeling for Mutation Explanation and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying protein mutations within amino acid sequences holds tremendous significance in life sciences. Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in broad biological applications. However, due to architectural design and lack of supervision, PLMs model mutations implicitly with evolutionary plausibility, which is not satisfactory to serve as explainable and engineerable tools in real-world studies. To address these issues, we present MutaPLM, a unified framework for interpreting and navigating protein mutations with protein language models. MutaPLM introduces a protein delta network that captures explicit protein mutation representations within a unified feature space, and a transfer learning pipeline with a chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy to harvest protein mutation knowledge from biomedical texts. We also construct MutaDescribe, the first large-scale protein mutation dataset with rich textual annotations, which provides cross-modal supervision signals. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that MutaPLM excels at providing human-understandable explanations for mutational effects and prioritizing novel mutations with desirable properties. Our code, model, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/PharMolix/MutaPLM.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Multiplectoneme Phases in DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stretched DNA molecule which is also under- or overwound, undergoes a buckling transition forming intertwined looped domains called plectonemes. Here we develop a simple theory that extends the two-phase model of stretched supercoiled DNA, allowing for the coexistence of multiple plectonemic domains by including positional and length distribution entropies. Such a multiplectoneme phase is favored in long DNA molecules in which the gain of positional entropy compensates for the cost of nucleating a plectoneme along a stretched DNA segment. Despite its simplicity, the developed theory is shown to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the twistable wormlike chain model. The theory predicts more plectonemes than experimentally observed, which we attribute to the limited resolution of experimental data. Since plectonemes are detected through fluorescence signals, those shorter than the observable threshold are likely missed.</description>

      <title>Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.</description>

      <title>Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom \textbf{Pep}tide design with \textbf{G}eometric \textbf{LA}tent \textbf{D}iffusion (PepGLAD) given the binding site. We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation.</description>

      <title>Protein-Nucleic Acid Complex Modeling with Frame Averaging Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleic acid-based drugs like aptamers have recently demonstrated great therapeutic potential. However, experimental platforms for aptamer screening are costly, and the scarcity of labeled data presents a challenge for supervised methods to learn protein-aptamer binding. To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening.</description>

Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Predicting Molecular Ground-State Conformation via Conformation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting ground-state conformation from the corresponding molecular graph is crucial for many chemical applications, such as molecular modeling, molecular docking, and molecular property prediction. Recently, many learning-based methods have been proposed to replace time-consuming simulations for this task. However, these methods are often inefficient and sub-optimal as they merely rely on molecular graph information to make predictions from scratch. In this work, considering that molecular low-quality conformations are readily available, we propose a novel framework called ConfOpt to predict molecular ground-state conformation from the perspective of conformation optimization. Specifically, ConfOpt takes the molecular graph and corresponding low-quality 3D conformation as inputs, and then derives the ground-state conformation by iteratively optimizing the low-quality conformation under the guidance of the molecular graph. During training, ConfOpt concurrently optimizes the predicted atomic 3D coordinates and the corresponding interatomic distances, resulting in a strong predictive model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConfOpt significantly outperforms existing methods, thus providing a new paradigm for efficiently and accurately predicting molecular ground-state conformation.</description>
