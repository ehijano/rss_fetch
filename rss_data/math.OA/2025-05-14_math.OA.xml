      <title>Hyperreflexivity of von Neumann algebras and similarity of finitely generated $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\cl A$ be a $C^*$-algebra. We say that $\cl A$ satisfies the SP if every bounded homomorphism $\cl A\to B(K)$, with $K$ a Hilbert space, is similar to a $*$-homomorphism. We introduce the following hypotheses:
  EPH.1 For every hyperreflexive von Neumann algebra $\cl A$ acting on the Hilbert space $H$ and every projection $Q\in B(H)$ the algebra $\cl A\vee \{Q\}^{''}$ is hyperreflexive.
  EPH.2 For every completely hyperreflexive von Neumann algebra $\cl A$ acting on the Hilbert space $H$ and every projection $Q\in B(H)$ the algebra $\cl A\wedge \{Q\}'$ is completely
  hyperreflexive.
  EPH.3 For every $Q_1, Q_2,...,Q_n, n\in \bb N$ projections the algebra $$\{Q_1\otimes I _{\ell^2(I)} \}'\wedge ...\wedge\{Q_n\otimes I _{\ell^2(I)}\}'$$ is hyperreflexive for all cardinals $I.$
  We prove that EPH.1 implies EPH.2, EPH.2 implies EPH.3 and that EPH.3 is equivalent to the statement that every finitely generated $C^*$-algebra satisfies the SP.</description>

      <title>Characteristic function of a power partial isometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model theory says that there is a bijection between the class of purely contractive analytic functions and the class of completely non-unitary (c.n.u. in short) contractions modulo unitary equivalence. In this paper we provide a complete classification of the purely contractive analytic functions such that the associated contraction is a c.n.u. power partial isometry. As an application of our findings, we determine a class of contractive polynomials such that the associated c.n.u. power partial isometry is of the explicit diagonal form $S \oplus N \oplus C$, where $S$ and $C^*$ are unilateral shifts and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we obtain a characterization of operator-valued symbols for which the corresponding Toeplitz operator on vector-valued Hardy space is a partial isometry.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability Relations induced by Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homomorphism indistinguishability is a way of characterising many natural equivalence relations on graphs. Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Examples of such equivalence relations include isomorphism and cospectrality, as well as equivalence with respect to many formal logics. Quantum groups are a generalisation of topological groups that describe "non-commutative symmetries" and, inter alia, have applications in quantum information theory. An important subclass are the easy quantum groups, which enjoy a combinatorial characterisation and have been fully classified by Raum and Weber. A recent connection between these seemingly distant concepts was made by Man\v{c}inska and Roberson, who showed that quantum isomorphism, a relaxation of classical isomorphism that can be phrased in terms of the quantum symmetric group, is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over the class of planar graphs. We generalise Man\v{c}inska and Roberson's result to all orthogonal easy quantum groups. We obtain for each orthogonal easy quantum group a graph isomorphism relaxation $\approx$ and a graph class $\mathcal{F}$, such that homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ coincides with $\approx$. Our results include a full classification of the $(0, 0)$-intertwiners of the graph-theoretic quantum group obtained by adding the adjacency matrix of a graph to the intertwiners of an orthogonal easy quantum group.</description>

      <title>Dilation on an annulus and von Neumann's inequality on certain varieties in the biball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof to Agler's famous result on success of rational dilation on an annulus by an application of a result due to Dritschel and McCullough. We show interplay between operators associated with an annulus, $C_{1,r}$ or quantum annulus and operator pairs living on a certain variety in $\mathbb C^2$ and its intersection with the biball. It is shown that the minimal spectral sets and von Neumann's inequality for these classes $C_{1,r}$, quantum annulus can also be studied via appropriate operator pairs associated with the biball.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for random covering surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show that the recent work of Magee, Puder and van Handel [MPvH25] can be applied to obtain an optimal spectral gap result with polynomial error rate for uniformly random covers of closed hyperbolic surfaces. Let $X$ be a closed hyperbolic surface. We show there exists $b,c&gt;0$ such that a uniformly random degree-$n$ cover $X_{n}$ of $X$ has no new Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}-cn^{-b}$ with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We present an example of a twist over a minimal Hausdorff \'etale groupoid such that the restriction of the twist to the interior of the isotropy is not topologically trivial; that is, the restricted twist is not induced by a continuous 2-cocycle.</description>

      <title>Resource-Dependent Complexity of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>
