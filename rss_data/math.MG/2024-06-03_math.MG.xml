      <title>Two new proofs of partial Godbersen's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two new proofs are provided, offering two new perspectives on Godbersen's conjecture. One of the proofs utilizes Helly's theorem to provide a concise and elegant proof of the inequality in Godbersen's conjecture. The other proof utilizes the Brunn-Minkowski inequality to provide a completely new proof of the inclusion $-K\subset nK$ for convex bodies $K$ with centroid at the origin, thereby proving Godbersen's conjecture.</description>

      <title>R-hulloid of the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $R$-hulloid, in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, of the set of vertices $V$ of a tetrahedron $T$ is the mimimal closed set containing $V$ such that its complement is union of open balls of radius $R$. When $R$ is greater than the circumradius of $T$, the boundary of the $R$-hulloid consists of $V$ and possibly of four spherical subsets of well defined spheres of radius $R$ through the vertices of $T$. The existence of a value $R^*$ such that these subsets collapse into one point $O^*\not \in V$ is investigated; in such case $O^*$ is in the interior of $T$ and belongs to four spheres of radius $R^*$, each one through three vertices of $T$ and not containing the fourth one. As a consequence, the range of $\rho$ such that $V$ is a $\rho$-body is described completely. This work generalizes to three dimensions previous results, proved in the planar case and related to the three circles Johnson's Theorem.</description>

      <title>A new trick for for Santalo's integral geometric proof of the strong Bonnesen inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a lamina $K$ whose boundary $\partial K$ is convex we define the Bonnesen functional by integrating over the position and orientation of a disk of radius $r$ its intersections with the lamina and its boundary. \[ B(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int (\frac{n}{2}-\nu)dx\,dy\,d\theta =rL-A-\pi r^2\] where $n$ is the number of intersections of the boundary of $K$ with the boundary of the disk and $\nu$ (with values either 0 or 1) is the number of intersections of the interiors. Analyzing the interval on which $B(r)\ge 0$ leads to a number of isoperimetric inequalities. For example Santalo observed that $B(r)$ is non-negative on $[r_{in},r_{out}]$ where $r_{in}$, the inradius, is the largest disk contained in $K$ and $r_{out}$, the outradius, is the smallest disk containing $K$. For this configuration if the bodies intersect than their boundaries must intersect in 2 or more points (generically) so the integrand is always non-negative and $B(r)\ge 0$. In this paper we show that $B(r)\ge 0$ on the interval$[\rho_{in}, \rho_{out}]$ where these are the inner and outer radii of the annulus of minimal width which surrounds $\partial K$. In this case the integrand is not always positive but we carefully analyze the integral and use an ``averaging trick'' to balance regions where the integrand is negative with regions where the integrand is positive to show that $B(r)\ge 0$ The final isoperimetric inequalities obtained are not new, the same results have been obtained by cleverly cutting $\partial K$ and doubling it to create two centrally symmetric curves and analyzing those, but I believe that the averaging trick is new in this context. The paper also reviews the concept of ``positive centers'' and shows how the isoperimetric inequalities can be used to the show that the final shape of the curve shortening flow in Euclidean and Minkowski geometries are respectively the disk and the isoperimetrix.</description>

      <title>The volume of an isocanted cube is a determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any dimension d&gt;=2, we give exact volume formulas of two mutually polar dual convex d--polytopes. The primal body is called isocanted cube of dimension d, depending on two real parameters 0&lt;a&lt;l. The limit case a=0 yields a d--cube of edge--length l. We prove that the volume of such a body is the determinant of the matrix of order d having diagonal entries equal to l and a elsewhere.
  We also compute the volume of the polar dual body, getting a rational expression in l and a, homogeneous of degree -d with rational coefficients.
  Isocanted cubes are origin--symmetric zonotopes. Zonoids (defined as the limits of families of zonotopes) satisfy the Mahler conjecture; in particular, zonotopes do. Nonetheless, we confirm (by elementary methods) that the Mahler conjecture holds for isocanted cubes.</description>

      <title>Can you hear the Planck mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the Laplacian of an $n$-Riemannian manifold $X$, the Weyl law states that the $k$-th eigenvalue is asymptotically proportional to $(k/V)^{2/n}$, where $V$ is the volume of $X$. We show that this result can be derived via physical considerations by demanding that the gravitational potential for a compactification on $X$ behaves in the expected $(4+n)$-dimensional way at short distances. In simple product compactifications, when particle motion on $X$ is ergodic, for large $k$ the eigenfunctions oscillate around a constant, and the argument is relatively straightforward. The Weyl law thus allows to reconstruct the four-dimensional Planck mass from the asymptotics of the masses of the spin 2 Kaluza--Klein modes. For warped compactifications, a puzzle appears: the Weyl law still depends on the ordinary volume $V$, while the Planck mass famously depends on a weighted volume obtained as an integral of the warping function. We resolve this tension by arguing that in the ergodic case the eigenfunctions oscillate now around a power of the warping function rather than around a constant, a property that we call weighted quantum ergodicity. This has implications for the problem of gravity localization, which we discuss. We show that for spaces with D$p$-brane singularities the spectrum is discrete only for $p =6,7,8$, and for these cases we rigorously prove the Weyl law by applying modern techniques from RCD theory.</description>

      <title>Limits of manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of \cite{YZ:inrdius},we develop the geometry of the limit spaces of compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, where we assume a lower sectional curvature bound,two sides bounds on the second fundamental forms of boundaries and an upper diameter bound. We mainly focus on the general case of non inradius collapse/convergence, where inradii of manifolds are uniformly bounded away from zero. In this case, many limit spaces have wild geometry, which arise from the boundary behavior of manifolds.Therefore the study of boundary singular points is a key to understand such limit spaces. We also present some global convergence/collapsing results.</description>

      <title>Structural characterizations and Obstructions to Planar-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a scale parameter $r&gt;0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex of $X \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (referred to as planar-Rips complex) under the usual Euclidean metric is a (finite) simplicial complex whose simplices are subsets of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. This paper focuses on characterizing the simplicial complexes that can or cannot be realized as planar-Rips complexes. Building on the prior work of Adamszek et al., we classify, up to simplicial isomorphism, all $n$-dimensional pseudomanifolds and weak-pseudomanifolds that admit a planar-Rips structure, and further characterize two-dimensional, pure, and closed planar-Rips complexes. Additionally, the notion of obstructions to planar-Rips complexes has been introduced, laying the groundwork for algorithmic approaches to identifying forbidden planar-Rips structures. We also explore the correlations between planar-Rips complexes and the class of intersection graphs called disk graphs, establishing a natural isomorphism between the two classes. Parallelly, our findings on planar-Rips complexes have been consolidated in terms of unit disk graphs for interested readers, depicting the significance of the topological and algebraic approaches. Several structural and geometric properties of planar-Rips complexes have been derived that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a metrizable space, we consider the space of all metrics generating the same topology of the metrizable space, and this space of metrics is equipped with the supremum metric. In this paper, for every metrizable space, we establish that the space of metrics on the metrizable space is Baire. We also show that the set of all complete metrics is comeager in the space of metrics. Moreover, we investigate non--Archimedean analogues of these results.</description>

      <title>$n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles cannot cover an equilateral triangle of side $&gt; n$ if all triangles have parallel sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conway and Soifer showed that an equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ with sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ can be covered by $n^2 + 2$ unit equilateral triangles. They conjectured that it is impossible to cover $T$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles no matter how small $\varepsilon$ is.
  We show that if we require all sides of the unit equilateral triangles to be parallel to the sides of $T$ (e.g. $\bigtriangleup$ and $\bigtriangledown$), then it is impossible to cover $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ with $n^2 + 1$ unit equilateral triangles for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. As the coverings of $T$ by Conway and Soifer only involve triangles with sides parallel to $T$, our result determines the exact minimum number $n^2+2$ of unit equilateral triangles with all sides parallel to $T$ that cover $T$. We also determine the largest value $\varepsilon = 1/(n + 1)$ (resp. $\varepsilon = 1 / n$) of $\varepsilon$ such that the equilateral triangle $T$ of side $n + \varepsilon$ can be covered by $n^2+2$ (resp. $n^2 + 3$) unit equilateral triangles with sides parallel to $T$, where the first case is achieved by the construction of Conway and Soifer.</description>

      <title>Half Space Property in RCD(0,N) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for $RCD(0,N)$ spaces, namely that if $(X,d,m)$ is a parabolic $RCD(0,N)$ space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a locally perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices. If the assumption of local perimeter minimizing is strengthened into global perimeter minimizing, then the conclusion can be strengthened into uniqueness of the horizontal slice. As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary) with non-negative Ricci curvature. On the way of proving the main results, we also obtain some properties of Green's functions on $RCD(K,N)$ spaces that are of independent interest.</description>
