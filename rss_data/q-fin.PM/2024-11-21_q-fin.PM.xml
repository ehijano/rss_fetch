      <title>Investor Sentiment in Asset Pricing Models: A Review of Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducted a comprehensive review of 71 papers published between 2000 and 2021 that employed various measures of investor sentiment to model returns. The analysis indicates that higher complexity of sentiment measures and models improves the coefficient of determination. However, there was insufficient evidence to support that models incorporating more complex sentiment measures have better predictive power than those employing simpler proxies. Additionally, the significance of sentiment varies based on the asset and time period being analyzed, suggesting that the consensus relying on the BW index as a sentiment measure may be subject to change.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Pipeline for Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization with Applications to Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>
