      <title>Imaging-Derived Coronary Fractional Flow Reserve: Advances in Physics-Based, Machine-Learning, and Physics-Informed Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose of Review Imaging derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) is rapidly evolving beyond conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based pipelines toward machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics informed approaches that enable fast, wire free, and scalable functional assessment of coronary stenosis. This review synthesizes recent advances in CT and angiography based FFR, with particular emphasis on emerging physics informed neural networks and neural operators (PINNs and PINOs) and key considerations for their clinical translation. Recent Findings ML/DL approaches have markedly improved automation and computational speed, enabling prediction of pressure and FFR from anatomical descriptors or angiographic contrast dynamics. However, their real-world performance and generalizability can remain variable and sensitive to domain shift, due to multi-center heterogeneity, interpretability challenges, and differences in acquisition protocols and image quality. Physics informed learning introduces conservation structure and boundary condition consistency into model training, improving generalizability and reducing dependence on dense supervision while maintaining rapid inference. Recent evaluation trends increasingly highlight deployment oriented metrics, including calibration, uncertainty quantification, and quality control gatekeeping, as essential for safe clinical use. Summary The field is converging toward imaging derived FFR methods that are faster, more automated, and more reliable. While ML/DL offers substantial efficiency gains, physics informed frameworks such as PINNs and PINOs may provide a more robust balance between speed and physical consistency. Prospective multi center validation and standardized evaluation will be critical to support broad and safe clinical adoption.</description>

      <title>Angle dependent dose transformer algorithm for fast proton therapy dose calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04375</link>

Abstract: Accurate 3D dose calculation for Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy (PBSPT) is typically performed with Monte Carlo (MC) engines, but their runtimes limit adaptive workflows and repeated evaluations. Current deep-learning proton dose engines often require orthogonality between proton rays and the CT grid, forcing computationally expensive beamlet-wise 3D reinterpolation. We propose the Angle-dependent Dose Transformer Algorithm (ADoTA), which eliminates grid rotation by augmenting the model input with a fast analytical beamlet-shape projection that explicitly encodes beam direction. The model was trained on CT data from 108 patients to predict beamlet dose distributions for initial energies of $70$--$270\,\mathrm{MeV}$ over an $80\times110\,\mathrm{mm}^2$ field, and tested on an independent cohort of 50 patients. On the test set, gamma pass rates $(1\%,3\,\mathrm{mm})$ were $99.40\pm0.86\%$ (thorax) and $99.87\pm0.23\%$ (abdomen/pelvis). Single-beamlet inference took $1.72\pm0.8\,\mathrm{ms}$. By avoiding reinterpolation, end-to-end 3D dose computation was reduced by $\approx86\%$ relative to the fastest published reinterpolation-based methods. For full treatment plans, gamma pass rates $\Gamma(2\%,2\,\mathrm{mm})$ with a 10\% dose cut-off reached $98.4\%$ (lung) and $98.9\%$ (prostate). ADoTA provides an angle-aware deep-learning proton dose engine that preserves MC-level accuracy across heterogeneous anatomies while substantially reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>A physics inspired and efficient transform for optoacoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optoacoustic imaging technologies require fast and accurate signal pre-processing algorithms to enable widespread deployment in clinical and home-care settings. However, they still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the default tool for essential signal-conditioning operations, which imposes hard limits on both execution speed and signal-retrieval accuracy. Here, we present a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on common signal-processing tasks using both simulations and experimental datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only sets a new lower bound on computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also substantially outperforms classical transforms on basic signal-processing operations in terms of accuracy. We expect this transform to catalyze broader adoption of optoacoustic methods.</description>
