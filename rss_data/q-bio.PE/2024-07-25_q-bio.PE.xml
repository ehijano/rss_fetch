      <title>A minimal model for multigroup adaptive SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the adaptive N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (aNIMFA) model studied in \emph{Achterberg and Sensi} \cite{achterbergsensi2022adaptive} to a heterogeneous network of communities. In particular, the multigroup aNIMFA model describes the impact of both local and global disease awareness on the spread of a disease in a network. We obtain results on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of the basic reproduction number~$R_0$. Under light constraints, we show that the basic reproduction number~$R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number of the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which contrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled out analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is more fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the disease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks with fewer links. Finally, we emphasise that our method of modelling adaptivity is not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Identification of a time-varying SIR Model for Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout human history, epidemics have been a constant presence. Understanding their dynamics is essential to predict scenarios and make substantiated decisions. Mathematical models are powerful tools to describe an epidemic behavior. Among the most used, the compartmental ones stand out, dividing population into classes with well-defined characteristics. One of the most known is the $SIR$ model, based on a set of differential equations describing the rates of change of three categories over time. These equations take into account parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the recovery rate, which both change over time. However, classical models use constant parameters and can not describe the behavior of a disease over long periods. In this work, it is proposed a $SIR$ model with time-varying transmission rate parameter with a method to estimate this parameter based on an optimization problem, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors between the model and historical data. Additionally, based on the infection rates determined by the algorithm, the model's ability to predict disease activity in future scenarios was also investigated. Epidemic data released by the government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil was used to evaluate the models, where the models shown a very good forecasting ability, resulting in errors for predicting the total number of accumulated infected persons of 0.13% for 7 days ahead and 0.6% for 14 days ahead.</description>

      <title>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at late times toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>
