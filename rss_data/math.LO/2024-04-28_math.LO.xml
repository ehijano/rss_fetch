      <title>Generic differentiability and $P$-minimal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove generic differentiability in $P$-minimal theories, strengthening an earlier result of Kuijpers and Leenknegt. Using this, we prove Onshuus and Pillay's $P$-minimal analogue of Pillay's conjectures on o-minimal groups. Specifically, let $G$ be an $n$-dimensional definable group in a highly saturated model $M$ of a $P$-minimal theory. Then there is an open definable subgroup $H \subseteq G$ such that $H$ is compactly dominated by $H/H^{00}$, and $H/H^{00}$ is a $p$-adic Lie group of the expected dimension.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantifiers using team semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependence logic provides an elegant approach for introducing dependencies between variables into the object language of first-order logic. In [1] generalized quantifiers were introduced in this context. However, a satisfactory account was only achieved for monotone increasing generalized quantifiers.
  In this paper, we modify the fundamental semantical guideline of dependence logic to create a framework that adequately handles both monotone and non-monotone generalized quantifiers. We demonstrate that this new logic can interpret dependence logic and possesses the same expressive power as existential second-order logic (ESO) on the level of formulas. Additionally, we establish truth conditions for generalized quantifiers and prove that the extended logic remains conservative over first-order logic with generalized quantifiers and is able to express the branching of continuous generalized quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Filtered Boolean powers of finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebra (e.g. a group, loop, ring). We investigate the Boolean power $\mathbf{D}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$ filtered at some idempotents $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$. When $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are all idempotents of $\mathbf{A}$ we establish two concrete representations of $\mathbf{D}$: as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite direct powers of $\mathbf{A}$, and as congruence classes of the countable free algebra in the variety generated by $\mathbf{A}$. Further, for arbitrary $e_1,\dots,e_n$, we show that $\mathbf{D}$ is $\omega$-categorical and that its automorphism group has the small index property, strong uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. As necessary background we establish some general properties of congruences and automorphisms of filtered Boolean powers of $\mathbf{A}$ by any Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$, including a semidirect decomposition for their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>An order analysis of hyperfinite Borel equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we first consider hyperfinite Borel equivalence relations with a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings. We define a notion of compatibility between such pairs, and prove a dichotomy theorem which characterizes exactly when a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings are compatible with each other. We show that, if a pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings are incompatible, then a canonical incompatible pair of Borel $\mathbb{Z}$-orderings of $E_0$ can be Borel embedded into the given pair. We then consider hyperfinite-over-finite equivalence relations, which are countable Borel equivalence relations admitting Borel $\mathbb{Z}^2$-orderings. We show that if a hyperfinite-over-hyperfinite equivalence relation $E$ admits a Borel $\mathbb{Z}^2$-ordering which is compatible with itself, then $E$ is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On piecewise hyperdefinable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.11669v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to generalize and improve two of the main model-theoretic results of "Stable group theory and approximate subgroups" by E. Hrushovski to the context of piecewise hyperdefinable sets. The first one is the existence of Lie models. The second one is the stabilizer theorem. In the process, a systematic study of the structure of piecewise hyperdefinable sets is developed. In particular, we show the most significant properties of their logic topologies.</description>

      <title>The definable content of homological invariants II: \v{C}ech cohomology and homotopy classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the \v{C}ech cohomology functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ taking values in the category $\mathsf{GPC}$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to show that a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement $S^3\backslash\Sigma$ to the $2$-sphere, is essentially hyperfinite but not smooth.
  In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of \v{C}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics.</description>

      <title>Transferring Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the technology of Radin forcing can be used to transfer compactness properties at a weakly inaccessible but not strong limit cardinal to a strongly inaccessible cardinal.
  As an application, relative to the existence of large cardinals, we construct a model of set theory in which there is a cardinal $\kappa$ that is $n$-$d$-stationary for all $n\in \omega$ but not weakly compact. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in the constructible universe $L$, where $\kappa$ being $(n+1)$-$d$-stationary is equivalent to $\kappa$ being $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_n$-indescribable. We also show that it is consistent that there is a cardinal $\kappa\leq 2^\omega$ such that $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ is $n$-stationary for all $\lambda\geq \kappa$ and $n\in \omega$, answering a question of Sakai.</description>

      <title>Completeness in local positive logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the basic model theory of local positive logic, a new logic that mixes positive logic (where negation is not allowed) and local logic (where models omit types of infinite distant pairs). We study several basic model theoretic notions such as compactness, positive closedness (existential closedness) and completeness (irreducibility).</description>

      <title>On metric approximate subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a metric $\mathrm{d}$ invariant under left and right translations, and let $\bar{\mathbb{D}}_r$ be the ball of radius $r$ around the identity. A $(k,r)$-metric approximate subgroup is a symmetric subset $X$ of $G$ such that the pairwise product set $XX$ is covered by at most $k$ translates of $X\bar{\mathbb{D}}_r$. This notion was introduced in arXiv:math/0601431 along with the version for discrete groups (approximate subgroups). In arXiv:0909.2190, it was shown for the discrete case that, at the asymptotic limit of $X$ finite but large, the "approximateness" (or need for more than one translate) can be attributed to a canonically associated Lie group. Here we prove an analogous result in the metric setting, under a certain finite covering assumption on $X$ replacing finiteness. In particular, if $G$ has bounded exponent, we show that any $(k,r)$-metric approximate subgroup is close to a $(1,r')$-metric approximate subgroup for an appropriate $r'$.</description>
