      <title>Bayesian Spatiotemporal Nonstationary Model Quantifies Robust Increases in Daily Extreme Rainfall Across the Western Gulf Coast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation exceedance probabilities are widely used in engineering design, risk assessment, and floodplain management. While common approaches like NOAA Atlas 14 assume that extreme precipitation characteristics are stationary over time, this assumption may underestimate current and future hazards due to anthropogenic climate change. However, the incorporation of nonstationarity in the statistical modeling of extreme precipitation has faced practical challenges that have restricted its applications. In particular, random sampling variability challenges the reliable estimation of trends and parameters, especially when observational records are limited. To address this methodological gap, we propose the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, a hierarchical Bayesian spatial framework that integrates nonstationarity and regionalization for robust frequency analysis of extreme precipitation. This model draws from extreme value theory, spatial statistics, and Bayesian statistics, and is validated through cross-validation and multiple performance metrics. Applying this framework to a case study of daily rainfall in the Western Gulf Coast, we identify robustly increasing trends in extreme precipitation intensity and variability throughout the study area, with notable spatial heterogeneity. This flexible model accommodates stations with varying observation records, yields smooth return level estimates, and can be straightforwardly adapted to the analysis of precipitation frequencies at different durations and for other regions.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the incidence rate and mortality rate ratio for chronic conditions based on aggregated current status data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the transition rates of the illness-death model (IDM) for chronic conditions are related to the percentages of people in the states by a three-dimensional system of differential equations [Bri24]. The aim of this article is to introduce a method to estimate the age-specific incidence rate together with the mortality rate ratio from aggregated current status (ACS) data. By ACS data we mean counts of (non-necessarily different) people in the three states of the IDM at different points in time. ACS data stem from epidemiological studies where only current disease status and vital status data need to be collected without following-up people (as, for example, in cohort studies). As an application, we use the theory in a simulation study about diabetes in Germany with 600 study subjects at eleven repeated cross-sections each of which with 50% participation quote. Special focus is given to stochastic dependency of the sampled participants. We find a good agreement between the estimates and the input parameters used for the simulation.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Characterization of Effect of Masks in Snapshot Compressive Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) refers to the recovery of three-dimensional data cubes-such as videos or hyperspectral images-from their two-dimensional projections, which are generated by a special encoding of the data with a mask. SCI systems commonly use binary-valued masks that follow certain physical constraints. Optimizing these masks subject to these constraints is expected to improve system performance. However, prior theoretical work on SCI systems focuses solely on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian masks, which do not permit such optimization. On the other hand, existing practical mask optimizations rely on computationally intensive joint optimizations that provide limited insight into the role of masks and are expected to be sub-optimal due to the non-convexity and complexity of the optimization. In this paper, we analytically characterize the performance of SCI systems employing binary masks and leverage our analysis to optimize hardware parameters. Our findings provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the role of binary masks - with both independent and dependent elements - and their optimization. We also present simulation results that confirm our theoretical findings and further illuminate different aspects of mask design.</description>

      <title>Improving exponential-family random graph models for bipartite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs, representing two-mode networks, arise in many research fields. These networks have two disjoint node sets representing distinct entity types, for example persons and groups, with edges representing associations between the two entity types. In bipartite graphs, the smallest possible cycle is a cycle of length four, and hence four-cycles are the smallest structure to model closure in such networks. Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) are a widely used model for social, and other, networks, including specifically bipartite networks. Existing ERGM terms to model four-cycles in bipartite networks, however, are relatively rarely used. In this work we demonstrate some problems with these existing terms to model four-cycles, and define new ERGM terms to help overcome these problems. The position of the new terms in the ERGM dependence hierarchy, and their interpretation, is discussed. The new terms are demonstrated in simulation experiments, and their application illustrated with ERGM models of empirical networks ranging in size from hundreds of nodes to hundreds of thousands of nodes.</description>

      <title>On The Performance of a Two-Sided Shewhart Chart for Continuous Proportions with Estimated Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the recent years there was an increased interest in studying the performance of different types of control charts, under various distributional models for continuous proportions, such as percentages and rates. In this work we consider the Kumaraswamy distribution, a popular and flexible distributional model for data in the unit interval (0,1) and investigate further the properties of a two-sided chart for individual observations for monitoring these types of processes, when the process parameters are unknown. Specifically, using Monte Carlo simulation, we evaluate the performance of the chart under a conditional perspective and provide empirical rules on how to select the appropriate size for the Phase I sample. In addition, we explore possible adjustments on the control limits of the chart, which take into account the available Phase I sample. The performance of the chart is also investigated for several out-of-control situations. The results show that for small and moderate size Phase I samples, practitioners have to choose whether they prefer a guaranteed in-control performance or an improved out-of-control performance. The implementation of the considered methods in practice is discussed via two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Bayesian Multitask Model with Scalable Inference for Microbiome Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian multitask learning model that is applicable to the general multi-task binary classification learning problem where the model assumes a shared sparsity structure across different tasks. We derive a computationally efficient inference algorithm based on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the potential of the new approach on various synthetic datasets and for predicting human health status based on microbiome profile. Our analysis incorporates data pooled from multiple microbiome studies, along with a comprehensive comparison with other benchmark methods. Results in synthetic datasets show that the proposed approach has superior support recovery property when the underlying regression coefficients share a common sparsity structure across different tasks. Our experiments on microbiome classification demonstrate the utility of the method in extracting informative taxa while providing well-calibrated predictions with uncertainty quantification and achieving competitive performance in terms of prediction metrics. Notably, despite the heterogeneity of the pooled datasets (e.g., different experimental objectives, laboratory setups, sequencing equipment, patient demographics), our method delivers robust results.</description>

      <title>Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. This study provides comprehensive, self-contained methodological details for investigating spatial interactions between individuals of the same species in wildlife populations. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears. This can be loosely interpreted to mean that a black bear is generally indifferent to the presence of other black bears living or wandering nearby.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm and Bounds for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. We also provide a sufficiency bound to the number of pooled tests required by any Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder with an arbitrary correlation between infected items. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal MAP performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least 25% compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Automated Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections: Safety and Efficiency Implications of Mixed-Human-Automated Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. The findings reveal a paradox in mixed traffic flow: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset utilized in this study is openly published to foster the research on AV-HV interactions.</description>
