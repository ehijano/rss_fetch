      <title>Explicit Universal and Approximate-Universal Kernels on Compact Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal kernels, whose Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space is dense in the space of continuous functions are of great practical and theoretical interest. In this paper, we introduce an explicit construction of universal kernels on compact metric spaces. We also introduce a notion of approximate universality, and construct tractable kernels that are approximately universal.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty principles for free metaplectic transformation and associated metaplectic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle for free metaplectic transformation, as well as metaplectic operators. Specifically, we obtain two different types of the uncertainty principle for free metaplectic transformations in terms of the so-called phase derivative, one of which can be generalized to the $L^p$-case with $1\le p\le 2$. The obtained results are valid not only for free metaplectic transformations but also for general metaplectic operators. In particular, we point out that our results are closely related to those given in \cite{Dias-deGosson-Prata}, and the relationship should be new and not exactly given in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>The generalized and pseudo $n$-strong Drazin inverse of the sum of elements in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by introducing some necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized $n$-strong Drazin invertibility (g$n$s-invertibility) and pseudo $n$-strong Drazin invertibility (p$n$s-invertibility) of an element in a Banach algebra for $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Subsequently, these results are utilized to prove some additive properties of g$n$s (p$n$s)-Drazin inverse in a Banach algebra. This process produces a generalization of some recent results of H Chen, M Sheibani (Linear and Multilinear Algebra \textbf{70.1} (2022): 53-65) for g$n$s and p$n$s-Drazin inverse. Furthermore, we define and characterize weighted g$n$s and weighted p$n$s-Drazin inverse in a Banach algebra.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Uniform Convergence Of Random Hermite Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the analysis of random series associated to the multidimensional harmonic oscillator $-\Delta + |x|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with d \geq 2$$. More precisely we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition to get the almost sure uniform convergence on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ . It turns out that the same condition gives the almost sure uniform convergence on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (despite $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ is a zero Lebesgue measure of $\mathbb{R}^d$). From a probabilistic point of view, our proof adapts a strategy used by the first author for boundaryless Riemannian compact manifolds. However, our proof requires sharp off-diagonal estimates of the spectral function of $-\Delta + |x|^2$ . Such estimates are obtained using elementary tools.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequality to the setting of Orlicz and Lorentz spaces. Furthermore, we generalize a Kadec--Pe{\l}czy\'nski-type result -- originally established by the first and third authors for $L^p$ spaces with $1 \le p &lt; 2$ -- to a broader class of Orlicz spaces defined via Young functions $\psi$ satisfying $x \le \psi(x) \le x^2$.</description>

      <title>On the Berezin range of Toeplitz and weighted composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we completely characterize the Berezin range of Toeplitz operators with harmonic symbols acting on weighted Bergman spaces, illustrating the necessity of the harmonicity condition through examples. We then introduce a new class of weighted composition operators on these spaces, investigating their fundamental properties and determining their Berezin range and Berezin number. Finally, we study the convexity of the Berezin range of composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces and show that the origin lies in its closure of Berezin range but not in the range itself.</description>

      <title>Metric functionals and weak convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of weak convergence in arbitrary metric spaces. Metric functionals are key in our analysis: weak convergence of sequences in a given metric space is tested against all the metric functionals defined on said space. When restricted to bounded sequences in normed linear spaces, we prove that our notion of weak convergence agrees with the standard one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the CP-distance as a measure of how far a Hermitian map is from being completely positive, deriving key properties and bounds. We investigate the role of CP-distance in the structural analysis of positive Hermitian linear maps between matrix algebras, focusing on its implications for quantum information theory. In particular, we derive bounds on the detection strength of entanglement witnesses. We elucidate the interplay between CP-distance and the structural properties of positive maps, offering insights into their decompositions. We also analyze how the CP-distance influences the decompositions of positive Hermitian maps, revealing its impact on the balance between completely positive components.</description>

Abstract: We derive a complete left-tail asymptotic series for the density of the {\it martingale limit} of a Galton-Watson process with immigration. We show that the series converges everywhere, not only for small arguments. This is the first complete result regarding the left tails of branching processes with immigration. A good, quickly computed approximation for the density will also be derived from the series.</description>

      <title>Transportation cost and contraction coefficient for channels on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a noncommutative optimal transport framework for quantum channels acting on von Neumann algebras. Our central object is the Lipschitz cost measure, a transportation-inspired quantity that evaluates the minimal cost required to move between quantum states via a given channel. Accompanying this is the Lipschitz contraction coefficient, which captures how much the channel contracts the Wasserstein-type distance between states. We establish foundational properties of these quantities, including continuity, dual formulations, and behavior under composition and tensorization. Applications include recovery of several mathematical quantities including expected group word length and Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance, via transportation cost. Moreover, we show that if the Lipschitz contraction coefficient is strictly less than one, one can get entropy contraction and mixing time estimates for certain classes of non-symmetric channels.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to foundations of the geometric measure theory in the infinite dimensional setting of the configuration space over the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$ equipped with the Poisson measure $\pi$. We first provide a rigorous meaning and construction of the $m$-codimensional Poisson measure -- formally written as "$(\infty-m)$-dimensional Poisson measure" -- on the configuration space. We then show that our construction is consistent with potential analysis by establishing the absolute continuity with respect to Bessel capacities. Secondly, we introduce three different definitions of BV functions based on the variational, relaxation and the semigroup approaches, and prove the equivalence of them. Thirdly, we construct perimeter measures and introduce the notion of the reduced boundary. We then prove that the perimeter measure can be expressed by the $1$-codimensional Poisson measure restricted on the reduced boundary, which is a generalisation of De Giorgi's identity to the configuration space. Finally, we construct the total variation measures for BV functions, and prove the Gau{\ss}--Green formula.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-Based Approach for Modelling Gaussian Processes with Functional Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are ubiquitous tools for modeling and predicting continuous processes in physical and engineering sciences. This is partly due to the fact that one may employ a Gaussian process as an interpolator while facilitating straightforward uncertainty quantification at other locations. In addition to training data, it is sometimes the case that available information is not in the form of a finite collection of points. For example, boundary value problems contain information on the boundary of a domain, or underlying physics lead to known behavior on an entire uncountable subset of the domain of interest. While an approximation to such known information may be obtained via pseudo-training points in the known subset, such a procedure is ad hoc with little guidance on the number of points to use, nor the behavior as the number of pseudo-observations grows large. We propose and construct Gaussian processes that unify, via reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the typical finite training data case with the case of having uncountable information by exploiting the equivalence of conditional expectation and orthogonal projections in Hilbert space. We show existence of the proposed process and establish that it is the limit of a conventional GP conditioned on an increasing number of training points. We illustrate the flexibility and advantages of our proposed approach via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Curvature bound of Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00262v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a strongly local symmetric Dirichlet form on the configuration space $\Upsilon$ whose symmetrising (thus also invariant) measure is $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$, which is the law of the sine $\beta$ ensemble for every $\beta&gt;0$. For every $\beta&gt;0$, this Dirichlet form satisfies the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ with $K=0$. This implies various functional inequalities, including the local Poincar\'e inequality, the local log-Sobolev inequality and the local hyper-contractivity. We then introduce an $L^2$-transportation-type extended distance $\bar{\sf d}_{\Upsilon}$ on $\Upsilon$, and prove the dimension-free Harnack inequality and several Lipschitz regularisation estimates of the $L^2$-semigroup associated with the Dirichlet form in terms of $\bar{\sf d}_{\Upsilon}$. As a result of $\mathsf{BE}(0,\infty)$, we obtain that the dual semigroup on the space of probability measures over $\Upsilon$, endowed with a Benamou--Brenier-like extended distance $\mathsf{W}_{\mathcal E}$, satisfies the evolutional variation inequality with respect to the Bolzmann--Shannon entropy $\mathsf{Ent}_{\mathsf{sine}_\beta}$ associated with $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$. Furthermore, the dual semigroup is characterised as the unique $\mathsf{W}_{\mathcal E}$-gradient flow in the space of probability measures with respect to $\mathsf{Ent}_{\mathsf{sine}_\beta}$. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for $\mathsf{BE}(K, \infty)$ beyond $\mathsf{sine}_\beta$ and apply it to the infinite particle diffusion whose symmetrising measure is the law of the $1$-dimensional $(\beta,s)$-circular Riesz gas with $\beta&gt;0$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banach famously related the smoothness of a function to the size of its level sets. More precisely, he showed that a continuous function is of bounded variation exactly when its "indicatrix" is integrable. In a similar vein, we connect the smoothness of the function -- measured now by its integral modulus of continuity -- to the structure of its superlevel sets. Our approach ultimately reduces to a continuum incidence problem for quantifying the regularity of open sets. The pay off is a refinement of Banach's original theorem and an answer to a question of Garsia--Sawyer.</description>

      <title>On cutoff via rigidity for high dimensional curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Lanvegin diffusions in Euclidean space, with curvature equal to the spectral gap. This includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as well as non Gaussian and non product extensions with convex interaction, such as the Dyson process from random matrix theory. We show that a cutoff phenomenon or abrupt convergence to equilibrium occurs in high-dimension, at a critical time equal to the logarithm of the dimension divided by twice the spectral gap. This cutoff holds for Wasserstein distance, total variation, relative entropy, and Fisher information. A key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. A novelty is the extensive usage of functional inequalities, even for short-time regularization, and the reduction to Wasserstein. The proofs are short and conceptual. Since the product condition is satisfied, an Lp cutoff hold for all p. We moreover discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, a link with logarithmic gradient estimates in short-time for the heat kernel, and ask about stability by perturbation. Finally, beyond rigidity but still for diffusions, a discussion around the recent progresses on the product condition for nonnegatively curved diffusions leads us to introduce a new curvature product condition.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a concrete operator system represented on some Hilbert space $H$. A $C^*$-support of $S$ is the $C^*$-algebra generated (via the Choi--Effros product) by $S$ inside an injective operator system acting on $H$. By leveraging Hamana's theory, we show that such a $C^*$-support is unique precisely when $C^*(S)$ is contained in every copy of the injective envelope of $S$ that acts on $H$. Further, we demonstrate how the uniqueness of certain $C^*$-supports can be used to give new characterizations of the unique extension property for $*$-representations, as well as the hyperrigidity of $S$. In another direction, we utilize the collection of all $C^*$-supports of $S$ to describe the subspace generated by the so-called abnormalities of $S$, thereby complementing a result of Kakariadis.</description>
