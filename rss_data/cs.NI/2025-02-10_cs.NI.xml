      <title>Mobile Network-specialized Large Language Models for 6G: Architectures, Innovations, Challenges, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional 5G network management mechanisms, that operate in isolated silos across different network segments, will experience significant limitations in handling the unprecedented hyper-complexity and massive scale of the sixth generation (6G). Holistic intelligence and end-to-end automation are, thus, positioned as key enablers of forthcoming 6G networks. The Large Language Model (LLM) technology, a major breakthrough in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, enjoys robust human-like language processing, advanced contextual reasoning and multi-modal capabilities. These features foster a holistic understanding of network behavior and an autonomous decision-making. This paper investigates four possible architectural designs for integrated LLM and 6G networks, detailing the inherent technical intricacies, the merits and the limitations of each design. As an internal functional building block of future 6G networks, the LLM will natively benefit from their improved design-driven security policies from the early design and specification stages. An illustrative scenario of slicing conflicts is used to prove the effectiveness of our architectural framework in autonomously dealing with complicated network anomalies. We finally conclude the paper with an overview of the key challenges and the relevant research trends for enabling Mobile Networkspecialized LLMs. This study is intended to provide Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) with a comprehensive guidance in their paths towards embracing the LLM technology.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modality Fusion: An AI-enabled Framework for Large-Scale Sensor Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development and operation of smart cities relyheavily on large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and sensor infrastructures that continuously monitor various aspects of urban environments. These networks generate vast amounts of data, posing challenges related to bandwidth usage, energy consumption, and system scalability. This paper introduces a novel sensing paradigm called Data-driven Modality Fusion (DMF), designed to enhance the efficiency of smart city IoT network management. By leveraging correlations between timeseries data from different sensing modalities, the proposed DMF approach reduces the number of physical sensors required for monitoring, thereby minimizing energy expenditure, communication bandwidth, and overall deployment costs. The framework relocates computational complexity from the edge devices to the core, ensuring that resource-constrained IoT devices are not burdened with intensive processing tasks. DMF is validated using data from a real-world IoT deployment in Madrid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately estimating traffic, environmental, and pollution metrics from a reduced set of sensors. The proposed solution offers a scalable, efficient mechanism for managing urban IoT networks, while addressing issues of sensor failure and privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Wireless Resource Management and Synchronization in Digital Twin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an accurate synchronization between a physical network and its digital network twin (DNT), which serves as a virtual representation of the physical network. The considered network includes a set of base stations (BSs) that must allocate its limited spectrum resources to serve a set of users while also transmitting its partially observed physical network information to a cloud server to generate the DNT. Since the DNT can predict the physical network status based on its historical status, the BSs may not need to send their physical network information at each time slot, allowing them to conserve spectrum resources to serve the users. However, if the DNT does not receive the physical network information of the BSs over a large time period, the DNT's accuracy in representing the physical network may degrade. To this end, each BS must decide when to send the physical network information to the cloud server to update the DNT, while also determining the spectrum resource allocation policy for both DNT synchronization and serving the users. We formulate this resource allocation task as an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total data rate of all users while minimizing the asynchronization between the physical network and the DNT. To address this problem, we propose a method based on the GRUs and the value decomposition network (VDN). Simulation results show that our GRU and VDN based algorithm improves the weighted sum of data rates and the similarity between the status of the DNT and the physical network by up to 28.96%, compared to a baseline method combining GRU with the independent Q learning.</description>

      <title>PDStream: Slashing Long-Tail Delay in Interactive Video Streaming via Pseudo-Dual Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) delay is critical for interactive video streaming (IVS) experiences, but remains unsatisfactory for its long-tail distribution caused by periodic large keyframes. Conventional optimization strategies, such as jitter buffer, bitrate adaptation, and customized encoding, either sacrifice clarity, average delay, or compatibility. To address this issue, we propose PDStream, a novel pseudo-dual streaming algorithm, aimed at minimizing E2E delay while maintaining video clarity. The core idea is to split the two functions, delay-sensitive playback and delay-tolerant reference, on keyframes through dual streaming. Specifically, the playback function is held by a second parallel stream, which comprises much smaller non-keyframes and is allocated more immediate bandwidth for real-time performance. The reference function is ensured by the first stream with keyframe preservation, allocated more subsequent bandwidth to smooth out bursty traffic. Additionally, ``pseudo'' minimizes computational and transmission overheads by restricting dual streams to brief activation only when keyframes appear, supported by corresponding dual-stream bitrate allocation and adaptation to ensure delay and clarity. We implement PDStream on a WebRTC-based IVS testbed with real-world network traces. Results show that PDStream significantly outperforms prior algorithms, reducing average E2E delay by 17.5\% and slashing its 97th percentile by 33.3\%, while keeping clarity under varying bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Securing 5G Bootstrapping: A Two-Layer IBS Authentication Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of authentication during the initial bootstrapping phase between cellular devices and base stations allows attackers to deploy fake base stations and send malicious messages to the devices. These attacks have been a long-existing problem in cellular networks, enabling adversaries to launch denial-of-service (DoS), information leakage, and location-tracking attacks. While some defense mechanisms are introduced in 5G, (e.g., encrypting user identifiers to mitigate IMSI catchers), the initial communication between devices and base stations remains unauthenticated, leaving a critical security gap. To address this, we propose E2IBS, a novel and efficient two-layer identity-based signature scheme designed for seamless integration with existing cellular protocols. We implement E2IBS on an open-source 5G stack and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation against alternative solutions. Compared to the state-of-the-art Schnorr-HIBS, E2IBS reduces attack surfaces, enables fine-grained lawful interception, and achieves 2x speed in verification, making it a practical solution for securing 5G base station authentication.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Pipeline Perspective on Video Streaming in Best-Effort Networks: A Survey and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remaining a dominant force in Internet traffic, video streaming captivates end users, service providers, and researchers. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by their problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition (simple heuristics), theory (formal optimization), or machine learning (generalizable data patterns). The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs and use of super resolution. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN) are transformative technologies in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. MEC pushes computational resources closer to end-users, enabling low latency and efficient processing, while ORAN promotes interoperability and openness in radio networks, thereby fostering innovation. This paper explores recent advancements in these two domains, with a particular focus on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being utilized to solve complex wireless challenges. In MEC, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is leveraged for optimizing computation offloading, ensuring energy-efficient solutions, and meeting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In ORAN, AI/ML is used to develop intelligent xApps for network slicing, scheduling, and online training to enhance network adaptability. This reading report provides an in-depth analysis of multiple key papers, discusses the methodologies employed, and highlights the impact of these technologies in improving network efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>InfinitePOD: Building Datacenter-Scale High-Bandwidth Domain for LLM with Optical Circuit Switching Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfinitePOD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfinitePOD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfinitePOD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</description>
