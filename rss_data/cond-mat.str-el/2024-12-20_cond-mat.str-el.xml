      <title>Altermagnetic phase transition in a Lieb metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the phase transition between a symmetric metallic parent state and itinerant altermagnetic order. The underlying mechanism we reveal in our microscopic model of electrons on a Lieb lattice does not involve orbital ordering, but derives from sublattice interference.</description>

      <title>Theory of intervalley-coherent AFM order and topological superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in the vicinity of insulating or Fermi surface reconstructed metallic states has established twisted bilayers of WSe$_2$ as an exciting platform to study the interplay of strong electron-electron interactions, broken symmetries and topology. In this work, we study the emergence of electronic ordering in twisted WSe$_2$ driven by gate-screened Coulomb interactions. Our first-principles treatment begins by constructing moir\'e Wannier orbitals that faithfully capture the bandstructure and topology of the system and project the gate-screened Coulomb interaction onto them. Using unbiased functional renormalization group calculations, we find an interplay between intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic order and chiral, mixed-parity $d/p$-wave superconductivity for carrier concentrations near the displacement field-tunable van-Hove singularity. Our microscopic approach establishes incommensurate intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as the dominant electronic mechanism driving the formation of superconductivity in $\theta = 5.08^{\circ}$ twisted WSe$_2$ and demonstrates that nesting properties of the Fermi surface sheets near the higher-order van-Hove point cause an asymmetric density dependence of the spin ordering as the density is varied across the van-Hove line, in good agreement with experimental observations. We show how the region of superconducting and magnetic order evolves within the two-dimensional phase space of displacement field and electronic density as twist angle is varied between $4^{\circ} \dots 5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Planon-modular fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Band Inversions in Topological Materials Using Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are characterized by insulating bulk states and robust metallic surface states. Band inversion is a hallmark of topological insulators: at time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a swapping of orbital character at the bulk band edges. In this work, we develop a novel method to detect band inversion within continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods that can accurately treat the electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling crucial to the physics of topological insulators. Our approach applies a momentum-space-resolved atomic population analysis throughout the first Brillouin zone utilizing the L\"owdin method and the one-body reduced density matrix produced with Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). We integrate this method into QMCPACK, an open source ab initio QMC package, so that these ground state methods can be used to complement experimental studies and validate prior DFT work on predicting the band structures of correlated topological insulators. We demonstrate this new technique on the topological insulator bismuth telluride, which displays band inversion between its Bi-p and Te-p states at the $\Gamma$-point. We show an increase in charge on the bismuth p orbital and a decrease in charge on the tellurium p orbital when comparing band structures with and without SOC. Additionally, we use our method to compare the degree of band inversion present in monolayer Bi$_2$Te$_3$, which has no interlayer van der Waals interactions, to that seen in the bulk. The method presented here will enable future, many-body studies of band inversion that can shed light on the delicate interplay between correlation and topology in correlated topological materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamic charge order from strong correlations in the cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge order has been a central focus in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors due to its intriguing yet not fully understood connection to superconductivity. Recent advances in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in the soft x-ray regime have enabled the first momentum-resolved studies of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates. This progress has opened a window for a more nuanced investigation into the mechanisms behind the formation of charge order (CO) correlations. This review provides an overview of RIXS-based measurements of dynamic CO correlations in various cuprate materials. It specifically focuses on electron-doped cuprates and Bi-based hole-doped cuprates, where the CO-related RIXS signals may reveal signatures of the effective Coulomb interactions. This aims to explore a connection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb correlations and CO-forming tendencies. Finally, we discuss current open questions and potential directions for future RIXS studies as the technique continues to improve and mature, along with other probes of dynamic correlations that would provide a more comprehensive picture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Continuous Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <title>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of fractionalized Shiba states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba state and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept to a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the dominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the fractionalized Shiba state. At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of $-1/2$ at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of laser science and technology have stimulated the study of condensed matter physics, especially, dynamical or non-equilibrium nature in solids. The laser technique in terahertz (THz) regime, whose photon energy is comparable to those of typical collective modes in solids such as magnetic excitations, phonons, etc., has remarkably proceeded in the last decade. Theoretical tools for non-equilibrium states have also progressed. Thanks to these backgrounds, magneto-optics, especially, the study of controlling magnetism with laser, now enters a new stage. For such controls, Floquet engineering is a key concept, which means the method of controlling static properties of targets with high-frequency external fields like laser. I review the theoretical foundation of Floquet engineering and its application to magnetic insulators. Basic magnetic quantities such as magnetization, spin chirality, and spin current are shown to be controlled with intense THz laser or wave.</description>

      <title>Observation of Mott-gap softening governed by Kitaev spin coupling in a-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominance of short-range spin Ising coupling in a-RuCl3 within a temperature range from 120 K to 7 K establishes it as a highly promising candidate for the Kitaev spin liquid. Here, employing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements, we present our observations on the temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra of monolayer a-RuCl3 directly grown on graphite. We observe a pronounced softening of the Mott gap upon warming the temperature from liquid nitrogen temperature to approximately 120 K, characterized by the shift of charge states in the edges of Hubbard bands toward the Mott gap. This transition temperature corresponds to the crossover from the Kitaev paramagnetic Mott insulator to the conventional paramagnetic Mott insulator of a-RuCl3. The same transition can also be seen in bulk form of a-RuCl3. Our findings suggest that the recombination of spinons and chargons during the disappearance of Kitaev spin coupling has significantly impacted the charge dynamics in the Mott insulator, even without altering the ratio between Coulomb repulsion and bandwidth. The results imply that a-RuCl3 could serve as an ideal platform for investigating the Mott physics across various spin states, encompassing antiferromagnetic-, spin-frustrated- and paramagnetic-phases.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been the focus of extensive experimental and theoretical research, as it is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects has sparked significant debates, especially on the strength of the spin excitations. We show that self-consistently incorporating spatial magnetic fluctuations into our theoretical framework significantly reduces the many-body effects in the system. Consistent with experimental observations, this reduction destabilizes the magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is not found in our calculations in contrast to previous theoretical studies. This resolution of the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the XXZ pyrochlore model from pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the magnetic phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest neighbor XXZ pyrochlore model using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group in the temperature flow formalism. Our phase diagram as a function of temperature and coupling ratio, allowing both longitudinal and transverse couplings to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, reveals a large non-magnetic regime at low temperatures, which includes the quantum spin ice phase near the antiferromagnetic Ising model, as well as the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models. We are able to detect magnetic phase transitions via critical finite size scaling down to temperatures two orders of magnitude smaller than the spin interactions, demonstrating the remarkably good performance of our method upon approaching the ground state. Specifically, the low temperature transition from the zero-flux quantum spin ice phase into the transverse ferromagnetic phase shows very good agreement with previous quantum Monte Carlo results. Comparing our findings with classical results, we identify a quantum order-by-disorder effect near the antiferromagnetic XY model. In magnetically disordered regimes, we find characteristic patterns of broadened pinch points in the spin structure factor and investigate their evolution when approaching magnetically ordered phases. We also compute linear responses to lattice symmetry breaking perturbations and identify a possible lattice nematic ground state of the antiferromagnetic XY model.</description>

      <title>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of interlayer magnetic coupling across the interface in antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of Neel temperature ($T_N$) of low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnets in antiferromagnetic bilayers AF1/AF2, where the $T_N$ of AF1 is larger than AF2 (for example enhancement of $T_{N}$ of CoO in CoO/NiO or FeO in FeO/CoO), is a subject of considerable interest. One essential question needs to be answered in these bilayers: is the interfacial coupling a short-range one or long-range that mediates the effect of the AF1 layers on the magnetic properties of AF2 layer? To understand the systematics of the magnetic coupling across the interface, we investigate the plane-resolved magnetotransport properties of antiferromagnetic bilayers using an electron-hole symmetric one-band Hubbard model at half-filling, employing a semi-classical Monte Carlo method. In our model Hamiltonian calculations, we set Coulomb repulsion $U_{1} = 8$ to mimic high-$T_{N}$ AF1 layer, whereas we use $U_{2}$ = $2\times U_{1}$ to mimic the low-$T_{N}$ AF2 layer. Our calculations show that the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet enhances substantially when it's thickness is small, similar to experiments, giving rise to single magnetic transition temperature of the bilayer system. These findings are well supported by a single peak in temperature-dependent specific heat. However, for larger thicknesses, the $T_{N}$ of the low-$T_{N}$ antiferromagnet approaches towards its bulk value and constituent antiferromagnetic layers align antiferromagnetically at two separate temperatures and two maxima are observed in specific heat data. Our calculations also show that the delocalization of moments is more or less confined near the interface indicating the short-ranged nature of the proximity effect. Our obtained results are consistent with the experimental observations. A detailed discussion of the modifications that will occur if we use $U_{1} = 8$ and $U_{2}$ = $0.5\times U_{1}$ will also be addressed.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of the Pseudogap in the Emery model: Insights for Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudogap in high-temperature superconducting cuprates is an exotic state of matter, displaying emerging Fermi arcs and a momentum-selective suppression of states upon cooling. We show how these phenomena are originating in the three-band Emery model by performing cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation calculations for its normal state. For the hole-doped parent compound our results demonstrate the formation of a pseudogap due to short-ranged commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations. At larger doping values, progressively, incommensurate correlations and a metallic regime appear. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the normal state of cuprates, and, hence, represent a crucial step towards the uniform description of their phase diagrams within a single theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry solutions in one-dimensional lattice models via many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\"uter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic structure factor of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ of the spin-1/2 chain with long-range, power-law decaying unfrustrated (sign alternating) Heisenberg interactions $J_r \sim (-1)^{r-1} r^{-\alpha}$ by means of stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) of imaginary-time correlations computed by quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We do so in both the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM, for $\alpha \lesssim 2.23$) and quasi ordered (QLRO, for $\alpha \gtrsim 2.23$) ground-state phases, employing different SAC parametrizations of $S(k,\omega)$ to resolve sharp edges characteristic of fractional quasi-particles and sharp peaks expected with conventional quasi-particles. In order to identify the most statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed cross-validation method as "model selection" tool. We confirm that the spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a very sharp (likely $\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase. From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different regimes of the model, and in the AFM phase, we extract the weight of the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional Heisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\omega)$ agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy dispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\omega_k \sim k^z$, and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\alpha)$, which in general is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This study serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Braiding for the win: Harnessing braiding statistics in topological states to win quantum games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</description>

      <title>Influence of Magnetic Anisotropy on the Ground State of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$: Insights into the Improper Modulated Magnetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid perovskites [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{x-1}$(HCOO)$_3$ with $x$ = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 possess multiple phase transitions including incommensurate structures. [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Ni(HCOO)$_3$ has also been found to have a proper magnetic incommensurate structure in its ground state. We have carried out a detailed structural characterization of the isomorphous [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$ (1) to investigate whether it also has incommensurate structural and magnetic modulations. We confirm that 1 crystallizes in the $Pnma$ space group at room temperature (RT) with a perovskite structure. Upon cooling, at about 170 K, the occurrence of new satellite reflections in the diffraction pattern show a phase transition to a modulated structure, which could be refined in the $Pnma(00\gamma)0s0$ super space group with $q_1~=~0.1662(2)c^\ast$. On further cooling to 75 K the satellite reflections become closer to the main reflections, indicating a new phase transition that keeps the super space group invariant but changes the modulation wave vector, $q_2~=~0.1425(2)c^\ast$. The structure then does not change structural phase down to base temperature (2 K). Magnetic susceptibility measurements collected under field-cooled and zero-field-cooled reveal a 3D antiferromagnetic order below 17 K. The overlapping in temperature between structural modulation and long-range magnetic order presents a unique opportunity to study magneto-structural coupling. Our results point to an improper modulated structure where interestingly the spins oriented strictly antiferromagnetic are perpendicular to those of previously reported compounds. In the present work, a combination of magnetometry measurements, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations have been used to accurately determine and understand the sequence of nuclear and magnetic phases present in compound 1.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

Abstract: The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d&gt;2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-driven topological quantum phase transition in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D &gt; 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for $D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D &gt; D_c$. Here, we review the main results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to integer spin $S&gt;1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hertz action and quantum criticality of two-dimensional Fermi systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Programmable Kondo Effect Formed by Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanobubbles wield significant influence over the electronic properties of 2D materials, showing diverse applications ranging from flexible devices to strain sensors. Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving pseudo Landau levels with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This results in a new flavor screening mechanism that drives an exotic flavor-frozen Kondo effect, which is absent in conventional Kondo systems. The resonance here also exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile new platform to simulate novel correlated phenomena based on pseudo Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Thermal decay of two-spinon bound states in quasi-2D triangular antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum phase transition leading to a spin liquid phase. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite N\'eel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a {\it terminated Goldstone regime} between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the magnons close to the Goldstone modes survive as well-defined excitations, up to the N\'eel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a transition to a disordered phase can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall effect in a highly conductive frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hall effect is one of the most fundamental but elusive phenomena in condensed matter physics due to the rich variety of underlying mechanisms. Here we report an exceptionally large Hall effect in a frustrated magnet GdCu$_2$ with high conductivity. The Hall conductivity at the base temperature is as high as 4 x 10$^4$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ and shows abrupt sign changes under magnetic fields. Remarkably, the giant Hall effect is rapidly suppressed as the longitudinal conductivity is lowered upon increasing temperature or introducing tiny amount of quenched disorder. Our systematic transport measurements together with neutron scattering measurements and ab initio band calculations indicate that the unusual Hall effect can be understood in terms of spin-splitting induced emergence/disappearance of Fermi pockets as well as skew scattering from spin-chiral cluster fluctuations in a field-polarized state. The present study demonstrates complex interplay among magnetization, spin-dependent electronic structure, and spin fluctuations in producing the giant Hall effect in highly conductive frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Theory of rare-earth Kramers magnets on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice: dimer phases in presence of strong spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system particularly known for the exact solvability of the singlet dimer phase as well as nearly flat triplon excitations in the Heisenberg limit, while the situation in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by the recently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit coupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit, peculiar "triplet" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit coupling. While the "singlet" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still exhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the isotropic Heisenberg model, these "triplet" dimer phases are generally not exactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further discuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these "triplet" dimer phases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet dimer ground state.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>
