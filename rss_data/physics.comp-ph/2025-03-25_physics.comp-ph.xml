      <title>Scalable physics-informed deep generative model for solving forward and inverse stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning approaches have been developed to solve forward and inverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) problems with high-dimensional stochastic space. However, the existing deep learning models have difficulties solving SDEs with high-dimensional spatial space. In the present study, we propose a scalable physics-informed deep generative model (sPI-GeM), which is capable of solving SDE problems with both high-dimensional stochastic and spatial space. The sPI-GeM consists of two deep learning models, i.e., (1) physics-informed basis networks (PI-BasisNet), which are used to learn the basis functions as well as the coefficients given data on a certain stochastic process or random field, and (2) physics-informed deep generative model (PI-GeM), which learns the distribution over the coefficients obtained from the PI-BasisNet. The new samples for the learned stochastic process can then be obtained using the inner product between the output of the generator and the basis functions from the trained PI-BasisNet. The sPI-GeM addresses the scalability in the spatial space in a similar way as in the widely used dimensionality reduction technique, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA). A series of numerical experiments, including approximation of Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic processes, forward and inverse SDE problems, are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model. Furthermore, we also show the scalability of the sPI-GeM in both the stochastic and spatial space using an example of a forward SDE problem with 38- and 20-dimension stochastic and spatial space, respectively.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Simulator for Electrically Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software.
  This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Lagrangian Shock Hydrodynamics with Application to Stable Shock Acceleration of Density Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a gradient based optimization approach for the equations of compressible, Lagrangian hydrodynamics and demonstrate how it can be employed to automatically uncover strategies to control hydrodynamic instabilities arising from shock acceleration of density interfaces. Strategies for controlling the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are of great benefit for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) where shock interactions with many small imperfections in the density interface lead to instabilities which rapidly grow over time. These instabilities lead to mixing which, in the case of laser driven ICF, quenches the runaway fusion process ruining the potential for positive energy return. We demonstrate that control of these instabilities can be achieved by optimization of initial conditions with (&gt; 100) parameters. Optimizing over a large parameter space like this is not possible with gradient-free optimization strategies. This requires computation of the gradient of the outputs of a numerical solution to the equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics with respect to the inputs. We show that the efficient computation of these gradients is made possible via a judicious application of (i) adjoint methods, the exact formal representation of sensitivities involving partial differential equations, and (ii) automatic differentiation (AD), the algorithmic calculation of derivatives of functions. Careful regularization of multiple operators including artificial viscosity and timestep control is required. We perform design optimization of &gt; 100 parameter energy field driving the Richtmyer Meshkov instability showing significant suppression while simultaneously enhancing the acceleration of the interface relative to a nominal baseline case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the complex interaction between CO2 and water in porous media at the pore scale is essential for various geoscience applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). We introduce a comprehensive dataset generated from high-fidelity numerical simulations to capture the intricate interaction between CO2 and water at the pore scale. The dataset consists of 624 2D samples, each of size 512x512 with a resolution of 35 {\mu}m, covering 100 time steps under a constant CO2 injection rate. It includes various levels of heterogeneity, represented by different grain sizes with random variation in spacing, offering a robust testbed for developing predictive models. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information crucial for benchmarking machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Individual and cooperative superexchange enhancement in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that the antiferromagnetic coupling within high temperature superconductors strongly exhibits a profound correlation with the upper limit of superconducting transition temperature these materials can reach. Thus, accurately calculating the positive and negative mechanisms that influence magnetic coupling in specific materials is crucial for the exploration of superconductivity at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to establish a complete description of electron correlations employing ab initio theories because of the large number of orbitals involved. In this study, we tackle the challenge of achieving high-level ab initio wave function theory calculations, which allow an explicit treatment of electron correlations associated with a large number of high-energy orbitals. We elucidate the atomic-shell-wise contributions to the superexchange coupling in the lanthanum cuprate, including individual effects of high-energy orbitals (Cu 4d, 5d, 4f, 5p) and cooperative effects between the core and these high-energy orbitals. Specifically, the prominent contributions from Cu 4d, 5d, 4f and 5p give rise to a rich collection of previously unexamined superexchange channels. We propose a p-d-f model to universally account for the contributions of high-energy orbitals at copper sites. Our calculations and physical rationalizations offer a more robust theoretical foundation for investigating cuprate-type high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing \textit{ab initio} calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a small equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirming the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective multi-fidelity strategy for the optimization of high-Reynolds number turbine flows guided by LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cost-effective multi-objective shape optimization strategy is proposed for high-Reynolds number flows involving complex phenomena such as boundary layer transition, shock-wave interactions, and turbulent wakes. These processes are poorly captured by Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models, necessitating higher-fidelity approaches like Large Eddy Simulation (LES). However, LES is computationally prohibitive at high Reynolds numbers, making its direct use in optimization impractical. To address this, we introduce a low-dimensional design space representation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and construct a multi-fidelity co-Kriging (MFK) surrogate model combining wall-resolved LES (WRLES) and RANS. Adaptive infill criteria are employed to strategically enrich the surrogate model within a limited computational budget (fewer than 10 LES samples). The methodology is applied to optimize a supersonic turbine vane for Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC), operating at Reynolds numbers of $\sim 10^6$. While RANS-LES correlation weakens near the optimal region, the MFK model outperforms single-fidelity Kriging (SFK) trained on the same LES data, effectively leveraging both abundant low-fidelity and scarce high-fidelity data. RANS accurately predicts global objective function trends but fails to resolve key flow features, whereas the MFK model captures fine-detail geometry trends from LES. Loss analysis reveals that LES is essential for identifying performance-detrimental mechanisms, while RANS-only optimization yields sub-optimal designs.</description>

      <title>Unravel the rotational and translational behavior of a single squirmer in flexible polymer solutions at different Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms thrive in complex environments and their behavior in fluids holds significant importance for various medical and industrial applications. By conducting Lattice Boltzmann simulations, the transport and rotational properties of a generic squirmer are investigated in solutions embedded with flexible polymers at different Reynolds numbers. The interplay of activity and heterogeneously distributed polymers have profound influences on these properties. Remarkable enhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the rotational motion, along with apparent decays in self-propelling velocities, are observed for squirmers with non-zero active stresses. These extraordinary phenomena stem from the squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions. Specifically, polymer wrapping occurs in front of a pusher, while numerous polymers are absorbed in the rear of a puller. Both mechanisms enhance the rotational motion and simultaneously impede translations through forces and torques arising from direct contacts or asymmetric local flows induced by polymers. The source dipole flow fields generated by a neutral swimmer rapidly advect polymers to the rear, leaving no apparent impacts on its rotational and transport properties. The influences of Reynolds number Re and squirmer-polymer boundary conditions (no-slip and repulsive) on the dynamics are addressed. In short, the no-slip boundary condition results in more profound effects on both rotational and translational properties at Re = 0.8. However, at Re = 0.04, the disparity between the two boundary conditions diminishes due to the heightened fluid viscous drag, which impedes direct contacts between squirmers and polymers. Our results reveal the relevance of system heterogeneity and highlight the essential role of squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions in shaping the behavior of swimmers in viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's Demon Is Foiled by the Entropy Cost of Measurement, Not Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I dispute the conventional claim that the second law of thermodynamics is saved from a "Maxwell's Demon" by the entropy cost of information erasure, and show that instead it is measurement that incurs the entropy cost. Thus Brillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was essentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's claim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable physics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the defeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from unphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as well as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes into computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations. I argue that the fundamental principle that saves the second law is the quantum uncertainty principle applying to the need to localize physical states to precise values of observables in order to effect the desired disequilibria aimed at violating the second law. I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the Szilard engine, which coincides with the quantity attributed to Landauer's principle. I also note that an experiment characterized as upholding an entropy cost of erasure in a "quantum Maxwell's Demon" actually demonstrates an entropy cost of measurement.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly Reduced-Order Modeling of the Filter Density Function with Time-Dependent Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dynamical low-rank approximation is developed for reduced-order modeling (ROM) of the filtered density function (FDF) transport equation, which is utilized for large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent reacting flows. In this methodology, the evolution of the composition matrix describing the FDF transport via a set of Langevin equations is constrained to a low-rank matrix manifold. The composition matrix is approximated using a low-rank factorization, which consists of two thin, time-dependent matrices representing spatial and composition bases, along with a small time-dependent coefficient matrix. The evolution equations for spatial and composition subspaces are derived by projecting the composition transport equation onto the tangent space of the low-rank matrix manifold. Unlike conventional ROMs, such as those based on principal component analysis, both subspaces are time-dependent and the ROM does not require any prior data to extract the low-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the constructed ROM adapts on the fly to changes in the dynamics. For demonstration, LES via the time-dependent bases (TDB) is conducted of the canonical configuration of a temporally developing planar CO/H2 jet flame. The flame is rich with strong flame-turbulence interactions resulting in local extinction followed by re-ignition. The combustion chemistry is modeled via the skeletal kinetics, containing 11 species with 21 reaction steps. It is shown that the FDF-TDB yields excellent predictions of various statistics of the thermo-chemistry variables, as compared to the full-order model (FOM).</description>

      <title>A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</description>

      <title>Large deformation and collapse analysis of re-entrant auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb lattice structures subjected to tension and compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compensation in Ising spin-$1/2$ site-diluted trilayered square ferrimagnets: Insights from Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</title>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic runtime advantage for all computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An enduring challenge in computer science is reducing the runtime required to solve computational problems. Quantum computing has attracted significant attention due to its potential to deliver asymptotically faster solutions to certain problems compared to the best-known classical algorithms. This advantage is enabled by the quantum mechanical nature of the logical degrees of freedom. To date, it was unknown if permitting other parts of the computer to be quantum mechanical, rather than semi-classical, could yield additional runtime speed-ups as a function of resource utilization (e.g., power consumption or cooling requirements).
  In this work, we prove that when the control mechanisms associated with gate implementation are optimal quantum mechanical states, a quadratic runtime speedup (with respect to power consumption) is achievable for any algorithm, relative to optimal classical or semi-classical control schemes. Moreover, we demonstrate that only a small fraction of the computer's architecture needs to employ optimal quantum control states to realize this advantage, thereby significantly simplifying the design of future systems.
  We call this new device a quantum frequential computer, since the quantum speedup arises from an increase in gate frequency. In current state-of-the-art designs, gate frequency is often limited by the coupling strength between components. Notably, our approach achieves the speedup without requiring an increase in coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>Optical Spiking Neurons Enable High-Speed and Energy-Efficient Optical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear hyperbolic PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. An effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods is presented. The calculated matrices are small matrices; and this allows to use effectively JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which allows to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. The complexity of developing an implementation based on the proposed approach does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation. Performance analysis using roofline partly explains the observed features of the decreasing of computational costs.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics From Video: Unsupervised Physical Parameter Estimation for Continuous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting physical dynamical system parameters from recorded observations is key in natural science. Current methods for automatic parameter estimation from video train supervised deep networks on large datasets. Such datasets require labels, which are difficult to acquire. While some unsupervised techniques--which depend on frame prediction--exist, they suffer from long training times, initialization instabilities, only consider motion-based dynamical systems, and are evaluated mainly on synthetic data. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method to estimate the physical parameters of known, continuous governing equations from single videos suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and robust to initialization. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and compute. We first evaluate our model on synthetic data, as commonly done. After which, we take the field closer to reality by recording Delfys75: our own real-world dataset of 75 videos for five different types of dynamical systems to evaluate our method and others. Our method compares favorably to others. %, yet, and real-world video datasets and demonstrate improved parameter estimation accuracy compared to existing methods.

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings in complex networks using discrete exterior calculus on higher--order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang {\em et al.}~[Math. Program. {\bf 127}, 203 (2011)], utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in higher--order networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect retrieval of true rankings to one of imperfect retrieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>
