      <title>Decentralized Collaborative Inertial Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although people spend most of their time indoors, outdoor tracking systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), are predominantly used for location-based services. These systems are accurate outdoors, easy to use, and operate autonomously on each mobile device. In contrast, Indoor Tracking Systems~(ITS) lack standardization and are often difficult to operate because they require costly infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an indoor tracking algorithm that uses collected data from inertial sensors embedded in most mobile devices. In this setting, mobile devices autonomously estimate their location, hence removing the burden of deploying and maintaining complex and scattered hardware infrastructure. In addition, these devices collaborate by anonymously exchanging data with other nearby devices, using wireless communication, such as Bluetooth, to correct errors in their location estimates. Our collaborative algorithm relies on low-complexity geometry operations and can be deployed on any recent mobile device with commercial-grade sensors. We evaluate our solution on real-life data collected by different devices. Experimentation with 16 simultaneously moving and collaborating devices shows an average accuracy improvement of 44% compared to the standalone Pedestrian Dead Reckoning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Universal Logical Quantum Photonic Neural Network Processor via Cavity-Assisted Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information within bosonic modes offers a promising direction for hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, achieving high-fidelity universal control over the bosonic degree of freedom using native photonic hardware remains a challenge. Here, we propose an architecture to prepare and perform logical quantum operations on arbitrary multimode multi-photon states using a quantum photonic neural network. Central to our approach is the optical nonlinearity, which is realized through strong light-matter interaction with a three-level Lambda atomic system. The dynamics of this interaction are confined to the single-mode subspace, enabling the construction of high-fidelity quantum gates. This nonlinearity functions as a photon-number selective phase gate, which facilitates the construction of a universal gate set and serves as the element-wise activation function in our neural network architecture. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by executing tasks that are key to logical quantum information processing. The network is able to deterministically prepare a wide array of multimode multi-photon states, including essential resource states. We also show that the architecture is capable of encoding and performing logical operations on bosonic error-correcting codes. Additionally, by adapting components of our architecture, error-correcting circuits can be built to protect bosonic codes. The proposed architecture paves the way for near-term quantum photonic processors that enable error-corrected quantum computation, and can be achieved using present-day integrated photonic hardware.</description>

      <title>MTDNS: Moving Target Defense for Resilient DNS Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most critical components of the Internet that an attacker could exploit is the DNS (Domain Name System) protocol and infrastructure. Researchers have been constantly developing methods to detect and defend against the attacks against DNS, specifically DNS flooding attacks. However, most solutions discard packets for defensive approaches, which can cause legitimate packets to be dropped, making them highly dependable on detection strategies. In this paper, we propose MTDNS, a resilient MTD-based approach that employs Moving Target Defense techniques through Software Defined Networking (SDN) switches to redirect traffic to alternate DNS servers that are dynamically created and run under the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) framework. The proposed approach is implemented in a testbed environment by running our DNS servers as separate Virtual Network Functions, NFV Manager, SDN switches, and an SDN Controller. The experimental result shows that the MTDNS approach achieves a much higher success rate in resolving DNS queries and significantly reduces average latency even if there is a DNS flooding attack.</description>

      <title>An Edge-Computing based Industrial Gateway for Industry 4.0 using ARM TrustZone Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure and efficient communication to establish a seamless nexus between the five levels of a typical automation pyramid is paramount to Industry 4.0. Specifically, vertical and horizontal integration of these levels is an overarching requirement to accelerate productivity and improve operational activities. Vertical integration can improve visibility, flexibility, and productivity by connecting systems and applications. Horizontal integration can provide better collaboration and adaptability by connecting internal production facilities, multi-site operations, and third-party partners in a supply chain. In this paper, we propose an Edge-computing-based Industrial Gateway for interfacing information technology and operational technology that can enable Industry 4.0 vertical and horizontal integration. Subsequently, we design and develop a working prototype to demonstrate a remote production-line maintenance use case with a strong focus on security aspects and the edge paradigm to bring computational resources and data storage closer to data sources.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Approximation Ratios for Warm-Started QAOA on 3-Regular Max-Cut Instances at Depth $p=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Farhi et al.'s 0.6924-approximation result technique of the Max-Cut Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on 3-regular graphs to obtain provable lower bounds on the approximation ratio for warm-started QAOA. Given an initialization angle $\theta$, we consider warm-starts where the initial state is a product state where each qubit position is angle $\theta$ away from either the north or south pole of the Bloch sphere; of the two possible qubit positions the position of each qubit is decided by some classically obtained cut encoded as a bitstring $b$.
  We illustrate through plots how the properties of $b$ and the initialization angle $\theta$ influence the bound on the approximation ratios of warm-started QAOA. We consider various classical algorithms (and the cuts they produce which we use to generate the warm-start). Our results strongly suggest that there does not exist any choice of initialization angle that yields a (worst-case) approximation ratio that simultaneously beats standard QAOA and the classical algorithm used to create the warm-start.
  Additionally, we show that at $\theta=60^\circ$, warm-started QAOA is able to (effectively) recover the cut used to generate the warm-start, thus suggesting that in practice, this value could be a promising starting angle to explore alternate solutions in a heuristic fashion.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-inspired Resnet and Densenet for Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks with residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognition. We explain the concrete frameworks and illustrate the potential superiority to prevent gradient explosion of our hybrid models. A group of numerical experiments about generalization power shows that our hybrid models possess the same generalization power as the pure classical models with different noisy datasets utilized. More importantly, another group of numerical experiments of robustness demonstrates that our hybrid models outperform pure classical models notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Also, an ablation study indicate that the recognition accuracy of our hybrid models is 2\%-3\% higher than that of the quantum neural network without residual or dense connection. Eventually, we discuss the application scenarios of our hybrid models by analyzing their computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>
