      <title>Bounding the Eviction Number of a Graph in Terms of its Independence Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An eternal dominating family of graph $G$ in the eviction game is a collection $\mathcal{D}_{k}=\{D_{1},...,D_{l}\}$ of dominating sets of $G$ such that (a) $|D_{i}|=|D_{j}|$ for all $i,j\in\{1,2,...,l\}$, and (b) for any $i\in \{1,2,...,l\}$ and any $v\in D_{i}$, either all neighbours of $v$ belong to $D_{i}$, or there are a neighbour $w$ of $v$ not in $D_{i}$ and an integer $j\in\{1,2,...,l\}\setminus\{i\}$ such that $D_{i}\cup\{w\}\setminus \{v\}=D_{j}$. The eviction number of $G$, denoted by $e^{\infty}(G)$, is the smallest cardinality of the sets in such an eternal dominating family.
  We compare $e^{\infty}$ to the independence number $\alpha$. We show that the ratio $\alpha/e^{\infty}$ is unbounded and construct an infinite class of connected graphs for which $e^{\infty}/\alpha \approx 4/3$. As our main result, we use Ramsey numbers to show that for any integer $k\geq1$, there exists a function $f(k)$ such that any graph with independence number $k$ has eviction number at most $f(k)$.</description>

      <title>Majority relations for Condorcet domains of tiling type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condorcet domains are subsets of permutations arising in voting theory: regarding their permutations as preference orders on a list of candidates, one avoids Condorcet's paradox when aggregating the preferences via a simple majority relation. We use poset theory to show that, for the subclass of Condorcet domains of tiling type, the majority rule has stronger properties. We then develop techniques to predict the majority rule explicitly for the uniform vote tally on Condorcet domains of tiling type, and apply this to several well-known examples.</description>

      <title>Majorization via positivity of Jack and Macdonald polynomial differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorization inequalities have a long history, going back to Maclaurin and Newton. They were recently studied for several families of symmetric functions, including by Cuttler--Greene--Skandera (2011), Sra (2016), Khare--Tao (2021), McSwiggen--Novak (2022), and Chen--Sahi (2024+) among others. Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for several cases of partitions, including all partitions with two parts. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.</description>

      <title>Stochastically Evolving Graphs via Edit Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a randomly evolving process of subgraphs in an underlying host graph using the spectral theory of semigroups related to the Tsetlin library and hyperplane arrangements. Starting with some initial subgraph, at each iteration, we apply a randomly selected edit to the current subgraph. Such edits vary in nature from simple edits consisting of adding or deleting an edge, or compound edits which can affect several edges at once. This evolving process generates a random walk on the set of all possible subgraphs of the host graph. We show that the eigenvalues of this random walk can be naturally indexed by subsets of edges of the host graph. We also provide, in the case of simple edits, a closed-form formula for the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix and a sharp bound for the rate of convergence of this random walk. We consider extensions to the case of compound edits; examples of this model include the previously studied Moran forest model and a dynamic random intersection graph model. Evolving graphs arise in a variety of fields ranging from deep learning and graph neural networks to epidemic modeling and social networks. Our random evolving process serves as a general stochastic model for sampling random subgraphs from a given graph.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.
  In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>There is no prime functional digraph: Seifert's proof revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A functional digraph is a finite digraph in which each vertex has a unique out-neighbor. Considered up to isomorphism and endowed with the directed sum and product, functional digraphs form a semigroup that has recently attracted significant attention, particularly regarding its multiplicative structure. In this context, a functional digraph $X$ divides a functional digraph $A$ if there exists a functional digraph $Y$ such that $XY$ is isomorphic to $A$. The digraph $X$ is said to be prime if it is not the identity for the product, and if, for all functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, the fact that $X$ divides $AB$ implies that $X$ divides $A$ or $B$. In 2020, Antonio E. Porreca asked whether prime functional digraphs exist, and in 2023, his work led him to conjecture that they do not. However, in 2024, Barbora Hudcov\'a discovered that this result had already been proved by Ralph Seifert in 1971, in a somewhat forgotten paper. The terminology in that work differs significantly from that used in recent studies, the framework is more general, and the non-existence of prime functional digraphs appears only as a part of broader results, relying on (overly) technical lemmas developed within this general setting. The aim of this note is to present a much more accessible version of Seifert's proof $-$ that no prime functional digraph exists $-$ by using the current language and simplifying each step as much as possible.</description>

      <title>On the pancyclicity of $2$-connected $[5,3]$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called an $[s,t]$-graph if any induced subgraph of $G$ of order $s$ has size at least $t$. In 2024, Zhan conjectured that every $2$-connected $[p + 2, p]$-graph of order at least $2p + 3$ and with minimum degree at least $p$ is pancyclic, where $p$ is an integer with $3 \leq p \leq 5$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for the case $p=3$, thereby taking the first step toward a complete resolution of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Triangle-Free Cyclic Graphs With Self-Loops Of Rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_S$ be a self-loop graph as the graph obtained by attaching a self-loop at every vertex in $S \subseteq V(G)$ of a simple graph $G.$ If $G=C_n$ is the cycle graphs of order $n$ and $S \neq \emptyset,$ we show that there are no rank 3 self-loop graphs $(C_n)_S$ for $n\geq 5.$ As a consequence, we determine and construct all possible rank 3 triangle-free self-loop cyclic graph of order at least 4 from $(C_4)_S$ via graph join operations. This provides a partial solution to the characterization problem of rank 3 self-loop graphs.</description>

      <title>New results on $k$-Roudenff's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of $k$-neighborly reorientations of an oriented matroid, leading to study $k$-Roudneff's conjecture, the case $k=1$ being the original statement conjectured in 1991. We first prove the conjecture for the family of Lawrence oriented matroids (LOMs) with even rank $r=2k+2$ and also for low ranks by computer. Next, we provide a general upper bound for the number of $k$-neighborly reorientations of any LOM. Finally, we prove that for any $k\ge 1$ and any oriented matroid on $n$ elements, $k$-Roudneff's conjecture holds asymptotically as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and thus giving more credit to the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semiorders induced by points drawn from a uniform random distribution. Of particular interest in this paper are the probabilities of generating specific semiorders and the equivalence classes they produce. We present a method for calculating the asymptotic probability of inducing these semiorders and describe the qualities which group these semiorders together. We also find a class of semiorders, called \emph{ladders}, whose probabilities can be calculated using the Up/Down numbers.</description>

      <title>Understanding the ratio of the partition sum to its Bethe approximation via double covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For various classes of graphical models it has been observed that the ratio of the partition sum to its Bethe approximation is often close to being the square of the ratio of the partition sum to its degree-2 Bethe approximation. This is of relevance because the latter ratio can often better be analyzed and/or quantified than the former ratio. In this paper, we give some justifications for the observed relationship between these two ratios and then analyze these ratios for two classes of log-supermodular graphical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an implementable algorithm which solves the conjugacy problem in twisted right-angled Artin groups (T-RAAGs). In certain cases, the complexity is known to be linear, by reducing the problem to the twisted conjugacy problem in right-angled Artin groups. We also show that T-RAAGs are biautomatic, providing an alternative solution to the conjugacy problem.</description>

      <title>Counting 2x2 integer matrices with a given determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, one has \[ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).\] This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that \[ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). \]</description>

      <title>Modularity from $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the community to provide a proof that takes the summatory forms of the Rogers--Ramanujan $q$-series as input and directly establishes their modularity. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for when holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|&lt;1$ form a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that for all finite colorings of an infinite set, there exists an infinite homogeneous subset. What if we seek a homogeneous subset that is also order-equivalent to the original set? Let $S$ be a linearly ordered set and $a \in N$. The big Ramsey degree of $a$ in $S$, denoted $T(a,S)$, is the least integer $t$ such that, for any finite coloring of the $a$-subsets of $S$, there exists $S'\subseteq S$ such that (i) $S'$ is order-equivalent to $S$, and (ii) if the coloring is restricted to the $a$-subsets of $S'$ then at most $t$ colors are used.
  Ma\v{s}ulovi\'{c} \&amp; \v{S}obot (2019) showed that $T(a,\omega+\omega)=2^a$. From this one can obtain $T(a,\zeta)=2^a$. We give a direct proof that $T(a,\zeta)=2^a$.
  Ma\v{s}ulovi\'{c} and \v{S}obot (2019) also showed that for all countable ordinals $\alpha &lt; \omega^\omega$, and for all $a \in N$, $T(a,\alpha)$ is finite. We find exact value of $T(a,\alpha)$ for all ordinals less than $\omega^\omega$ and all $a\in N$.</description>

Abstract: A family of $r$ distinct sets $\{A_1,\ldots, A_r\}$ is an $r$-sunflower if for all $1 \leqslant i &lt; j \leqslant r$ and $1 \leqslant i' &lt; j' \leqslant r$, we have $A_i \cap A_j = A_{i'} \cap A_{j'}$. Erd\H{o}s and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family $\mathcal{H}$ of $\ell$-element sets of size at least $K(r)^\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that depends only on $r$. We prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a family of $\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (C r (\log d+\log^\ast \ell))^\ell$ for some absolute constant $C &gt; 0$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (r-1)^\ell$ is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of rational-value sums or zero-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the maximum number of $r$-term sums admitting rational values in $n$-element sets of irrational numbers? We determine the maximum when $r&lt;4$ or $r\geq n/2$ and also in case when we drop the condition on the number of summands. It turns out that the $r$-term sum problem is equivalent to determine the maximum number of $r$-term zero-sum subsequences in $n$-element sequences of integers, which can be seen as a variant of the famous Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem.</description>

      <title>Advances on the Packing Coloring Conjectures of Subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(s_1,s_2, \dots, s_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $s_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. The packing chromatic number $\chi_{\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $p$ such that $G$ is $(1,2,\dots ,p)$-packing colorable. Gastineau and Togni asked whether the subdivision $S(G)$ of every subcubic graph $G$ has $\chi_{\rho}(S(G))\leq 5$ and whether every subcubic graph, except the Petersen graph, is $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable; these questions were later conjectured by Bre\v{s}ar et al. Moreover, Gastineau and Togni proved that a positive answer to the second question implies a positive answer to the first. In this paper, we completely resolve the second question for connected non-regular subcubic graphs, proving that they are $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable and hence satisfy $\chi_{\rho}(S(G)) \leq 5$. We also establish the same result for several classes of cubic graphs, including those with diamonds, certain cut-vertices, and bridges on short cycles. Finally, we strengthen the recent result of Liu, Zhang, and Zhang [\textit{Discrete Math.} 348 (11) (2025). 114610] that every subcubic graph is $(1,1,2,2,3)$-packing colorable by proving that every connected cubic graph admits a $(1,1,2,2,k)$-packing coloring in which at most one vertex receives color $k$, where $k$ is arbitrary. This not only simplifies the existing argument but also strictly improves the bound.</description>

      <title>Necklaces, permutations, and periodic critical orbits for quadratic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ denote the $n^{\rm th}$ Gleason polynomial, whose roots correspond to parameters $c$ such that the critical point $0$ is periodic of exact period $n$ under iteration of $z^2 + c$, and let $\bar{G}_n$ denote the reduction of $G_n$ modulo $2$. Buff, Floyd, Koch, and Parry made the surprising observation that the number of real roots of $G_n$ is equal to the number of irreducible factors of $\bar{G}_n$ for all $n$. We provide a bijective proof for this result by first providing explicit bijections between (a) the set of real roots of $G_n$ and the set $\bar{N}(n)$ of equivalence classes of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ under the inversion map swapping $0$ and $1$; and (b) the set of irreducible factors of $G_n$ modulo 2 and the set $\tilde{N}^+(n)$ of binary necklaces which are either primitive of length $n$ with an even number of $1$'s or primitive of length $n/2$ with an odd number of $1$'s. We then provide an explicit bijection, closely related to Milnor and Thurston's kneading theory, between $\bar{N}(n)$ and $\tilde{N}^+(n)$. In addition, we provide explicit bijections between $\bar{N}(n)$, the set ${\rm CUP}(n)$ of cyclic unimodal permutations of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$, and the set $N^-(n)$ of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ with an odd number of $1$'s.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Generalized Tur\'{a}n Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Tur\'{a}n problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}. We also conclude with a generalization of a result by Balister-Bollob\'{a}s-Riordan-Schelp \cite{BALISTER2003366}.</description>

      <title>Density Characterization with The Upper Bound of Density of Fibonacci Word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the natural density and structural relationships within Fibonacci words, the density of a Fibonacci word is $\operatorname{DF}(F_k)=n/(n+m),$ where $m$ denote the number of zeros in a Fibonacci word and $n$ denote the units digit. Through analysis of these ratios and their convergence to powers of $\varphi$, we illustrate the intrinsic exponential growth rates characteristic of Fibonacci words. By considering the natural density concept for sets of positive integers, it is demonstrated that the density of Fibonacci words approaches unity, correlating with classical results on Fibonacci number distributions as \[ \operatorname{DF}(F_k) &lt;\frac{m(m+1)}{n(2m-n+1)}. \] Furthermore, generating functions and combinatorial formulas for general terms of Fibonacci words are derived, linking polynomial expressions and limit behaviors integral to their combinatorial structure. The study is supplemented by numerical data and graphical visualization, confirming theoretical findings and providing insights into the early transient and asymptotic behavior of Fibonacci word densities.</description>

Abstract: In 2012, Andrews and Merca proved a truncated theorem on Euler's pentagonal number theorem, which opened up a new study on truncated theta series. In particular, some truncated versions of a identity of Gauss have been proved. In this article, we provide new combinatorial interpretations of the truncated versions of the identity of Gauss in terms of the minimal excludant non-overlined part of an overpartition.</description>

      <title>Spanning Factorizations in Vertex-Transitive Digraphs of Degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of spanning 1-factorizations in vertex-transitive digraphs of out-degree d. The open question is whether every such digraph admits a spanning 1-factorization that includes, for each vertex v, all d out-edges (v,F_i(v)) from v.
  This paper focuses on the case d=2. Using the structure of alternating cycles and block systems, we develop a block/phase framework that yields sufficient conditions for including both F_1,F_2. We show that certain block obstructions can prevent their simultaneous inclusion, while sharply transitive sets (and hence spanning 1-factorizations) always exist. Our results provide general constraints on feasible block sizes, describe the role of phase distributions, and illustrate the theory with concrete families, including coset digraphs on A_5. The necessity of the block criterion remains open, even in degree 2.</description>

      <title>Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of Some Bull-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edge, a {\em fork } is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and an {\em odd torch} is a graph obtained from an odd hole by adding an edge $xy$ such that $x$ is nonadjacent to any vertex on the odd hole and the set of neighbors of $y$ on the odd hole is a stable set.
  Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019) 54-60] proved that every (odd hole, bull)-free graph and every ($P_5$, bull)-free graph are perfectly divisible. Karthick {\em et al.} [The Electron. J. of Combin. 29 (2022) P3.19.] proved that every (fork, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Chen and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 372 (2025) 298-307.] proved that every ($P_7,C_5$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Let $H\in$\{\{odd~torch\}, $\{P_8,C_5\}\}$. In this paper, we prove that every ($H$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. We also prove that a ($P_6$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Mycielski-Gr\"{o}tzsch graph as an induced subgraph. As corollaries, these graphs is $\binom{\omega+1}{2}$-colorable. Notice that every odd torch contains an odd hole, a $P_5$, and a fork. Therefore, our results generalize the results of these scholars. Moreover, we prove that every ($P_6$, bull)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\omega(G)^7$.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on Random Access Efficiency for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of the recently proposed random access coverage depth problem for DNA data storage. Under this paradigm, it is assumed that the user information consists of $k$ information strands, which are encoded into $n$ strands via a generator matrix $G$. During the sequencing process, the strands are read uniformly at random, as each strand is available in a large number of copies. In this context, the random access coverage depth problem refers to the expected number of reads (i.e., sequenced strands) required to decode a specific information strand requested by the user. This problem heavily depends on the generator matrix $G$, and besides computing the expectation for different choices of $G$, the goal is to construct matrices that minimize the maximum expectation over all possible requested information strands, denoted by $T_{\max}(G)$.
  In this paper, we introduce new techniques to investigate the random access coverage depth problem, capturing its combinatorial nature and identifying the structural properties of generator matrices that are advantageous. We establish two general formulas to determine $T_{\max}(G)$ for arbitrary generator matrices. The first formula depends on the linear dependencies between columns of $G$, whereas the second formula takes into account recovery sets and their intersection structure. We also introduce the concept of recovery balanced codes and provide three sufficient conditions for a code to be recovery balanced. These conditions can be used to compute $T_{\max}(G)$ for various families of codes, such as MDS, simplex, Hamming, and binary Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, we study the performance of modified systematic MDS and simplex matrices, showing that the best results for $T_{\max}(G)$ are achieved with a specific combination of encoded strands and replication of the information strands.</description>

      <title>A threshold for relative hyperbolicity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ whose presentation graph $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ is an Erd{\H o}s--R\'enyi random graph on $n$ vertices with edge probability $p=p(n)$. We establish that $p=1/\sqrt{n}$ is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random group $W_{\Gamma}$. As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.
  We also show that there is an interval of edge probabilities of width $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$ in which the random right-angled Coxeter group has precisely cubic divergence. This interval is between the thresholds for relative hyperbolicity (whence exponential divergence) and quadratic divergence. Moreover, a simple random walk on any Cayley graph of the random right-angled Coxeter group for $p$ in this interval satisfies a central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: We show that if all the finite coset spaces of a polycyclic group have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size then the group is virtually nilpotent. We obtain the same conclusion for a finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent group under the weaker assumption that the finite quotient groups have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size. This extends work of Khukhro and Valette.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14274v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate several basic properties of Verma supermodules over regular symmetrizable Kac--Moody Lie superalgebras, exhibiting $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$-nature as revealed through changing Borel subalgebras.
  We investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras, which enable us to realize the principal block of $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category $\mathcal{O}$. This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks.
  On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.</description>

      <title>Zero-free sector of the Wronski map on the totally nonnegative Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical result states that if $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ with nonnegative coefficients, then $f(z)$ has no zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ of the complex plane, and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Motivated by the Shapiro--Shapiro conjecture and related problems in real Schubert calculus, we generalize this result to Wronskians of polynomials. Namely, let $f_1(z), \dots, f_k(z)$ be linearly independent polynomials of degree at most $n$ whose coefficient matrix has all nonnegative $k\times k$ minors (that is, the polynomials span an element of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian in the sense of Lusztig and Postnikov). We show that the Wronskian polynomial $\operatorname{Wr}(f_1, \dots, f_k)$ has no complex zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ (independent of $k$), and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Our proof uses classical results of Gantmakher and Krein (1950) and Obreschkoff (1923) on sign variation.</description>
