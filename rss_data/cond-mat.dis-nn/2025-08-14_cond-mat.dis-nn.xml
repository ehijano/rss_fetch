      <title>Anomalous Critical Behavior of Driven Disordered Systems Beyond the Overdamped Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of relaxation mechanisms in the driven response of elastic disordered interfaces in finite dimensions, focusing on the interplay between dimensionality and interaction range. Through extensive numerical simulations, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes. In two-dimensional systems with long-range interactions, we observe a regime of coexistence between pinned and flowing states. In contrast, for one-dimensional interfaces with long-range elasticity, as well as for short-range interactions in both 1D and 2D, the coexistence regime is absent. Nevertheless, the avalanche statistics differ significantly from those of overdamped systems: the usual power-law distribution is replaced by a pronounced bump, associated with large, anomalous avalanches that expand ballistically. We interpret these events as failed synchronization attempts and suggest they could be detected in experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Learning complexity of many-body quantum sign structures through the lens of Boolean Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ans\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\"atze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced topological phases in monolayer amorphous carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving non-topological materials out of equilibrium using time-periodic perturbations, such as circularly-polarized laser light, is a compelling way to engineer topological phases. At the same time, topology has traditionally only been considered for crystalline materials. Here we propose an experimentally feasible way of driving monolayer amorphous carbon topological. We show that circularly polarized laser light induces both regular and anomalous edge modes at quasienergies $0$ and $\pm \pi$, respectively. We also obtain complete topological characterization using an energy- and space-resolved topological marker based on the spectral localizer. Additionally, by introducing atomic coordination defects in the amorphous carbon, we establish the importance of the local atomic structure in topological amorphous materials. Our work establishes amorphous systems, including carbon, as a versatile and abundant playground to engineer topological phases.</description>

      <title>Free-Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in ${\cal O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.</description>
