      <title>Higher-order spacings in the superposed spectra of random matrices with comparison to spacing ratios and application to complex systems</title>

Abstract: The connection between random matrices and the spectral fluctuations of complex quantum systems in a suitable limit can be explained by using the setup of random matrix theory. Higher-order spacing statistics in the $m$ superposed spectra of circular random matrices are studied numerically. We tabulated the modified Dyson index $\beta'$ for a given $m$, $k$, and $\beta$, for which the nearest neighbor spacing distribution is the same as that of the $k$-th order spacing distribution corresponding to the $\beta$ and $m$. Here, we conjecture that for given $m(k)$ and $\beta$, the obtained sequence of $\beta'$ as a function of $k(m)$ is unique. This result can be used as a tool for the characterization of the system and to determine the symmetry structure of the system without desymmetrization of the spectra. We verify the results of the $m=2$ case of COE with the quantum kicked top model corresponding to various Hilbert space dimensions. From the comparative study of the higher-order spacings and ratios in both $m=1$ and $m=2$ cases of COE and GOE by varying dimension, keeping the number of realizations constant and vice-versa, we find that both COE and GOE have the same asymptotic behavior in terms of a given higher-order statistics. But, we found from our numerical study that within a given ensemble of COE or GOE, the results of spacings and ratios agree with each other only up to some lower $k$, and beyond that, they start deviating from each other. It is observed that for the $k=1$ case, the convergence towards the Poisson distribution is faster in the case of ratios than the corresponding spacings as we increase $m$ for a given $\beta$. Further, the spectral fluctuations of the intermediate map of various dimensions are studied. There, we find that the effect of random numbers used to generate the matrix corresponding to the map is reflected in the higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Minimum Sample Size Calculation for Multivariable Regression of Continuous Outcomes in Chemometrics for Astrobiology and Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01210</link>

Abstract: Over the last few decades, prediction models have become a fundamental tool in statistics, chemometrics, and related fields. However, to ensure that such models have high value, the inferences that they generate must be reliable. In this regard, the internal validity of a prediction model might be threatened if it is not calibrated with a sufficiently large sample size, as problems such as overfitting may occur. Such situations would be highly problematic in many fields, including space science, as the resulting inferences from prediction models often inform scientific inquiry about planetary bodies such as Mars. Therefore, to better inform the development of prediction models, we applied a theory-based guidance from the biomedical domain for establishing what the minimum sample size is under a range of conditions for continuous outcomes. This study aims to disseminate existing research criteria in biomedical research to a broader audience, specifically focusing on their potential applicability and utility within the field of chemometrics. As such, the paper emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinarity, bridging the gap between the medical domain and chemometrics. Lastly, we provide several examples of work in the context of space science. This work will be the foundation for more evidence-based model development and ensure rigorous predictive modelling in the search for life and possible habitable environments.</description>
