      <title>Speaker Embeddings With Weakly Supervised Voice Activity Detection For Efficient Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speaker diarization systems rely on an external voice activity detection model prior to speaker embedding extraction on the detected speech segments. In this paper, we establish that the attention system of a speaker embedding extractor acts as a weakly supervised internal VAD model and performs equally or better than comparable supervised VAD systems. Subsequently, speaker diarization can be performed efficiently by extracting the VAD logits and corresponding speaker embedding simultaneously, alleviating the need and computational overhead of an external VAD model. We provide an extensive analysis of the behavior of the frame-level attention system in current speaker verification models and propose a novel speaker diarization pipeline using ECAPA2 speaker embeddings for both VAD and embedding extraction. The proposed strategy gains state-of-the-art performance on the AMI, VoxConverse and DIHARD III diarization benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PolyGlotFake: A Novel Multilingual and Multimodal DeepFake Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI, multimodal deepfakes, which manipulate both audio and visual modalities, have drawn increasing public concern. Currently, deepfake detection has emerged as a crucial strategy in countering these growing threats. However, as a key factor in training and validating deepfake detectors, most existing deepfake datasets primarily focus on the visual modal, and the few that are multimodal employ outdated techniques, and their audio content is limited to a single language, thereby failing to represent the cutting-edge advancements and globalization trends in current deepfake technologies. To address this gap, we propose a novel, multilingual, and multimodal deepfake dataset: PolyGlotFake. It includes content in seven languages, created using a variety of cutting-edge and popular Text-to-Speech, voice cloning, and lip-sync technologies. We conduct comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art detection methods on PolyGlotFake dataset. These experiments demonstrate the dataset's significant challenges and its practical value in advancing research into multimodal deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Naturalistic Music Decoding from EEG Data via Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the potential of using latent diffusion models, a family of powerful generative models, for the task of reconstructing naturalistic music from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Emotion Prediction and Control in Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains a challenge to effectively control the emotion rendering in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Prior studies have primarily focused on learning a global prosodic representation at the utterance level, which strongly correlates with linguistic prosody. Our goal is to construct a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) that effectively encapsulates intensity variations of emotions at various levels of granularity, encompassing phonemes, words, and utterances. During TTS training, the hierarchical ED is extracted from the ground-truth audio and guides the predictor to establish a connection between emotional and linguistic prosody. At run-time inference, the TTS model generates emotional speech and, at the same time, provides quantitative control of emotion over the speech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of emotion prediction and control.</description>

      <title>Perception-Inspired Graph Convolution for Music Understanding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new graph convolutional block, called MusGConv, specifically designed for the efficient processing of musical score data and motivated by general perceptual principles. It focuses on two fundamental dimensions of music, pitch and rhythm, and considers both relative and absolute representations of these components. We evaluate our approach on four different musical understanding problems: monophonic voice separation, harmonic analysis, cadence detection, and composer identification which, in abstract terms, translate to different graph learning problems, namely, node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Our experiments demonstrate that MusGConv improves the performance on three of the aforementioned tasks while being conceptually very simple and efficient. We interpret this as evidence that it is beneficial to include perception-informed processing of fundamental musical concepts when developing graph network applications on musical score data.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of generating dance from music is crucial, yet current methods, which mainly produce joint sequences, lead to outputs that lack intuitiveness and complicate data collection due to the necessity for precise joint annotations. We introduce a Dance Any Beat Diffusion model, namely DabFusion, that employs music as a conditional input to directly create dance videos from still images, utilizing conditional image-to-video generation principles. This approach pioneers the use of music as a conditioning factor in image-to-video synthesis. Our method unfolds in two stages: training an auto-encoder to predict latent optical flow between reference and driving frames, eliminating the need for joint annotation, and training a U-Net-based diffusion model to produce these latent optical flows guided by music rhythm encoded by CLAP. Although capable of producing high-quality dance videos, the baseline model struggles with rhythm alignment. We enhance the model by adding beat information, improving synchronization. We introduce a 2D motion-music alignment score (2D-MM Align) for quantitative assessment. Evaluated on the AIST++ dataset, our enhanced model shows marked improvements in 2D-MM Align score and established metrics. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems via Audio Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the widespread application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, their security concerns have received much more attention than ever before, primarily due to the susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks. Previous studies have illustrated that surreptitiously crafting adversarial perturbations enables the manipulation of speech recognition systems, resulting in the production of malicious commands. These attack methods mostly require adding noise perturbations under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, inevitably leaving behind artifacts of manual modifications. Recent research has alleviated this limitation by manipulating style vectors to synthesize adversarial examples based on Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis audio. However, style modifications based on optimization objectives significantly reduce the controllability and editability of audio styles. In this paper, we propose an attack on ASR systems based on user-customized style transfer. We first test the effect of Style Transfer Attack (STA) which combines style transfer and adversarial attack in sequential order. And then, as an improvement, we propose an iterative Style Code Attack (SCA) to maintain audio quality. Experimental results show that our method can meet the need for user-customized styles and achieve a success rate of 82% in attacks, while keeping sound naturalness due to our user study.</description>

      <title>Kid-Whisper: Towards Bridging the Performance Gap in Automatic Speech Recognition for Children VS. Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, exemplified by Whisper, have demonstrated the potential of these systems to approach human-level performance given sufficient data. However, this progress doesn't readily extend to ASR for children due to the limited availability of suitable child-specific databases and the distinct characteristics of children's speech. A recent study investigated leveraging the My Science Tutor (MyST) children's speech corpus to enhance Whisper's performance in recognizing children's speech. They were able to demonstrate some improvement on a limited testset. This paper builds on these findings by enhancing the utility of the MyST dataset through more efficient data preprocessing. We reduce the Word Error Rate (WER) on the MyST testset 13.93% to 9.11% with Whisper-Small and from 13.23% to 8.61% with Whisper-Medium and show that this improvement can be generalized to unseen datasets. We also highlight important challenges towards improving children's ASR performance. The results showcase the viable and efficient integration of Whisper for effective children's speech recognition.</description>

      <title>A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of labeled data is a major challenge in audiovisual speech emotion recognition (SER). Self-supervised learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate the need for labeled data in various applications. This paper proposes the VQ-MAE-AV model, a vector quantized masked autoencoder (MAE) designed for audiovisual speech self-supervised representation learning and applied to SER. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed method employs a self-supervised paradigm based on discrete audio and visual speech representations learned by vector quantized variational autoencoders. A multimodal MAE with self- or cross-attention mechanisms is proposed to fuse the audio and visual speech modalities and to learn local and global representations of the audiovisual speech sequence, which are then used for an SER downstream task. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, which is pre-trained on the VoxCeleb2 database and fine-tuned on standard emotional audiovisual speech datasets, outperforms the state-of-the-art audiovisual SER methods. Extensive ablation experiments are also provided to assess the contribution of the different model components.</description>

      <title>Not My Voice! A Taxonomy of Ethical and Safety Harms of Speech Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid and wide-scale adoption of AI to generate human speech poses a range of significant ethical and safety risks to society that need to be addressed. For example, a growing number of speech generation incidents are associated with swatting attacks in the United States, where anonymous perpetrators create synthetic voices that call police officers to close down schools and hospitals, or to violently gain access to innocent citizens' homes. Incidents like this demonstrate that multimodal generative AI risks and harms do not exist in isolation, but arise from the interactions of multiple stakeholders and technical AI systems. In this paper we analyse speech generation incidents to study how patterns of specific harms arise. We find that specific harms can be categorised according to the exposure of affected individuals, that is to say whether they are a subject of, interact with, suffer due to, or are excluded from speech generation systems. Similarly, specific harms are also a consequence of the motives of the creators and deployers of the systems. Based on these insights we propose a conceptual framework for modelling pathways to ethical and safety harms of AI, which we use to develop a taxonomy of harms of speech generators. Our relational approach captures the complexity of risks and harms in sociotechnical AI systems, and yields a taxonomy that can support appropriate policy interventions and decision making for the responsible development and release of speech generation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation models have opened new avenues in musical creativity. However, music generation usually involves iterative refinements, and how to edit the generated music remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to the editing of music generated by such models, enabling the modification of specific attributes, such as genre, mood and instrument, while maintaining other aspects unchanged. Our method transforms text editing to \textit{latent space manipulation} while adding an extra constraint to enforce consistency. It seamlessly integrates with existing pretrained text-to-music diffusion models without requiring additional training. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over both zero-shot and certain supervised baselines in style and timbre transfer evaluations. Additionally, we showcase the practical applicability of our approach in real-world music editing scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges associated with both the conversion between different spatial audio formats and the decoding of a spatial audio format to a specific loudspeaker layout. Existing approaches often rely on layout remapping tools, which may not guarantee optimal conversion from a psychoacoustic perspective. To overcome these challenges, we present the Universal Spatial Audio Transcoder (USAT) method and its corresponding open source implementation. USAT generates an optimal decoder or transcoder for any input spatial audio format, adapting it to any output format or 2D/3D loudspeaker configuration. Drawing upon optimization techniques based on psychoacoustic principles, the algorithm maximizes the preservation of spatial information. We present examples of the decoding and transcoding of several audio formats, and show that USAT approach is advantageous compared to the most common methods in the field.</description>

      <title>The Codecfake Dataset and Countermeasures for the Universally Detection of Deepfake Audio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Audio Language Model (ALM) based deepfake audio, there is an urgent need for generalized detection methods. ALM-based deepfake audio currently exhibits widespread, high deception, and type versatility, posing a significant challenge to current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models trained solely on vocoded data. To effectively detect ALM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the mechanism of the ALM-based audio generation method, the conversion from neural codec to waveform. We initially construct the Codecfake dataset, an open-source large-scale dataset, including 2 languages, over 1M audio samples, and various test conditions, focus on ALM-based audio detection. As countermeasure, to achieve universal detection of deepfake audio and tackle domain ascent bias issue of original SAM, we propose the CSAM strategy to learn a domain balanced and generalized minima. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that ADD model training with the Codecfake dataset can effectively detects ALM-based audio. Furthermore, our proposed generalization countermeasure yields the lowest average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.616% across all test conditions compared to baseline models. The dataset and associated code are available online.</description>

      <title>EVDA: Evolving Deepfake Audio Detection Continual Learning Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced large language models such as GPT-4, GPT-4o, and the Claude family has made fake audio detection increasingly challenging. Traditional fine-tuning methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving landscape of synthetic speech, necessitating continual learning approaches that can adapt to new audio while retaining the ability to detect older types. Continual learning, which acts as an effective tool for detecting newly emerged deepfake audio while maintaining performance on older types, lacks a well-constructed and user-friendly evaluation framework. To address this gap, we introduce EVDA, a benchmark for evaluating continual learning methods in deepfake audio detection. EVDA includes classic datasets from the Anti-Spoofing Voice series, Chinese fake audio detection series, and newly generated deepfake audio from models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. It supports various continual learning techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Learning without Forgetting (LwF), and recent methods like Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM) and Radian Weight Modification (RWM). Additionally, EVDA facilitates the development of robust algorithms by providing an open interface for integrating new continual learning methods</description>
