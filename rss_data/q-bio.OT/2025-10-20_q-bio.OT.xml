      <title>Evaluation and Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Early Detection of Kidney and Heart Disease in Diabetic Patients</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are major complications of diabetes, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Early detection of these conditions is critical, yet traditional diagnostic markers often lack sensitivity in the initial stages. This study integrates conventional statistical methods with machine learning approaches to improve early diagnosis of CKD and CVD in diabetic patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed in SPSS to explore associations between diseases and clinical or demographic factors. Patients were categorized into four groups: Group A both CKD and CVD, Group B CKD only, Group C CVD only, and Group D no disease. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations: Serum Creatinine and Hypertension with CKD, and Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Hypertension with CVD. These results guided the selection of predictive features for machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented, with Random Forest showing the highest accuracy, particularly for CKD prediction. Ensemble models outperformed single classifiers in identifying high-risk diabetic patients. SPSS results further validated the significance of the key parameters integrated into the models. While challenges such as interpretability and class imbalance remain, this hybrid statistical machine learning framework offers a promising advancement toward early detection and risk stratification of diabetic complications compared to conventional diagnostic approaches.</description>
