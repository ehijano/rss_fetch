      <title>Benoist-Hulin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Benoist-Hulin group is, by definition, a subgroup $\Gamma$ of ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ such that any $\Gamma$-invariant closed set consisting of Jordan curves in the space of closed subsets of the Riemann sphere that are not singletons is composed of $K$-quasicircles for some $K \ge 1$. Y.Benoist and D.Hulin showed that the full group ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ is a Benoist-Hulin group. In this paper, we develop the theory of Benoist-Hulin groups and show that both uniform lattices and parabolic subgroups are Benoist-Hulin groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the symplectic elimnation algorithm. This algorithm using simple row operations reduce a symplectic matrix to a diagonal matrix. This algorithm gives rise to a decomposition of an arbitrary matrix into a product of a symplectic matrix and a reduced matrix. This decomposition is similar to the SR decomposition studied for a long time, which is analogous to the QR decomposition.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of abelianizations of the genus 3 Johnson kernel and the commutator subgroup of the Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_g^b$ be a compact oriented surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components, where $b\in\{0,1\}$. The Johnson kernel $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g^b)$ generated by Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves. Let $F_n$ be a free group with $n$ generators. The Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ is the subgroup $\mathrm{IO}_n\subset\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ consisting of all outer automorphisms that act trivially on the abelianization of $F_n$. Long standing questions are whether the groups $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]$ or their abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_g^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated for $g\ge3$ (respectively, $n\ge3$). During the last 15 years, these questions were answered positively for $g\ge4$ and $n\ge4$, respectively. Nevertheless, the cases of $g=3$ and $n=3$ remained completely unsettled. In this paper, we prove that the abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_3^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_3,\mathrm{IO}_3]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated. Our approach is based on a new general sufficient condition for a module over a Laurent polynomial ring to be finitely generated as an abelian group.</description>

      <title>Profinite groups with complemented closed subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to be a $C$-group if every subgroup $H$ has a permutable complement, i.e. if there exists a subgroup $K$ of $G$ such that $G=HK$ and $H \cap K=1$. In this paper, we study the profinite counterpart of this concept. We say that a profinite group $G$ is profinite-$C$ if every closed subgroup admits a closed permutable complement. We first give some equivalent variants of this condition and then we determine the structure of profinite-$C$ groups: they are the semidirect products $G=B\ltimes A$ of two closed subgroups $A=\text{Cr}_{i\in I} \, \langle a_i \rangle$ and $B=\text{Cr}_{j\in J} \, \langle b_j \rangle$ that are cartesian products of cyclic groups of prime order, and with every $\langle a_i \rangle$ normal in $G$. Finally, we show that a profinite-$C$ group is a $C$-group if and only if it is torsion and $|G:Z(G)\overline{G'}|&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Transformations of Triads and Seventh Chords: Group Extensions and Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformational music theory, pioneered by David Lewin, uses simply transitive group actions to analyze music. In this paper, we construct a simply transitive group action on a disjoint union of two sets, built from a simply transitive action on each set and an equivariant bijection connecting them. Motivational examples are the omnibus progression and the reflected omnibus progression, which involve the consonant triads and the dominant/half-diminished seventh chords, connected by the inclusion bijection. We provide other examples from Jazz tunes. More generally, we combine multiple simply transitive group actions via a "meta-rotation"; examples include a simply transitive group acting on consonant triads and a variety of seventh chords, as well as a meta-rotation that realizes the root position seventh chord sequence of the flattening transformation (described by Clough-Douthett's J-function). The constructions in our theorems extend Lewin dual pairs to Lewin dual pairs. We formulate the constructions in terms of short exact sequences and central extensions as well. Contextual groups are also elucidated: the interval content of the generating pitch-class segment determines whether or not a generalized contextual group is generated by contextual inversions.</description>

      <title>Derangements in finite classical groups and characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first obtain explicit upper bounds for the proportion of elements in a finite classical group G with a given characteristic polynomial. We use this to complete the proof that the proportion of elements of a finite classical group G which lie in a proper irreducible subgroup tends to 0 as the dimension of the natural module goes to infinity. This result is analogous to the result of Luczak and Pyber [15] that the proportion of elements of the symmetric group S_n which are contained in a proper transitive subgroup other than the alternating group goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. We also show that the probability that 3 random elements of SL(n,q) invariably generate goes to 0 as n goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proved that for every $r,s \in \mathbb{N}\backslash \{0,1\}$ the action of $\mathbb{F}_{r+s}$ on $\partial_\beta (\mathbb{F}_{r+s}/\mathbb{F}_r)$ is topologically amenable. In particular the $C^*$-algebra associated to the corresponding quasi-regular representation has a unique non-trivial ideal. The techniques involved rely on a study of dynamical properties for actions on non-standard boundaries studied by the author and F. R{\u a}dulescu in previous works.</description>

      <title>On Alperin's conjecture and functorial equivalence of blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$ and let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We consider Alperin's weight conjecture (over $k$) from the point of view of (stable) functorial equivalence of blocks over $\mathbb{F}$. We formulate a functorial version of Alperin's blockwise weight conjecture, and show that it is equivalent to the original one. We also show that this conjecture holds stably, i.e., in the category of stable diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $\mathbb{F}$.</description>

      <title>Coadjoint orbits of low dimension for nilradicals of Borel subalgebras in classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak g$ be a classical simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic zero or large enough, and let $\mathfrak n$ be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The main tool in representation theory of $\mathfrak n$ is the orbit method, which classifies primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathfrak n)$ and unitary representations of the unipotent group $N=\exp(\mathfrak n)$ in terms of coadjoint orbits on the dual space $\mathfrak n^*$. In the paper, we describe explicitly coadjoint orbits of low dimension for $\mathfrak n$ as above. The answer is given in terms of subsets of positive roots. As a corollary, we provide a way to calculate the number of irreducible complex representations of dimensions $q$, $q^2$ and $q^3$ for a maximal unipotent subgroup $N(q)$ in a classical Chevalley group $G(q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q$ elements. It turned out that this number is a polynomial in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, which agrees with Isaac's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tangent Lie Algebras of Automorphism Groups of Free Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the Andreadakis-Johnson filtration for automorphism groups of free algebras and introduce the notion of tangent Lie algebras for certain automorphism groups, defined as subalgebras of the Lie algebra of derivations. We show that, for many classical varieties of algebras, the tangent Lie algebra is contained in the Lie algebra of derivations with constant divergence. We also introduce the concepts of approximately tame and absolutely wild automorphisms of free algebras in arbitrary varieties and employ tangent Lie algebras to investigate their properties. It is shown that nearly all known examples of wild automorphisms of free algebras are absolutely wild -- with the notable exceptions of the Nagata and Anick automorphisms. We show that the Bergman automorphism of free matrix algebras of order two is absolutely wild. Furthermore, we prove that free algebras in any variety of polynilpotent Lie algebras -- except for the abelian and metabelian varieties -- also possess absolutely wild automorphisms.</description>

      <title>A Novel Post-Quantum Secure Digital Signature Scheme Based on Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic primitives that ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. In the post-quantum era, classical public key-based signature schemes become vulnerable to brute-force and key-recovery attacks due to the computational power of quantum algorithms. Multivariate polynomial based signature schemes are among the one of the cryptographic constructions that offers strong security guarantees against such quantum threats. With the growing capabilities of neural networks, it is natural to explore their potential application in the design of cryptographic primitives. Neural networks inherently captures the non-linear relationships within the data, which are encoded in their synaptic weight matrices and bias vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel construction of a multivariate polynomial based digital signature scheme that leverages neural network architectures. A neural network with binary weights is employed to define the central structure of the signature scheme. The design introduces a recurrent random vector, functionally analogous to an attention mechanism, which contributes dynamic randomness based on the previous state, thereby enhancing the scheme's security. It is demonstrated that the proposed signature scheme provide security against Existential Unforgeability under adaptive Chosen-Message Attacks (EUF-CMA). Furthermore, it is proven that direct attacks aimed to recover the private keys are computationally infeasible within polynomial time, even in the presence of quantum computing abilities. The operational characteristics of the proposed scheme are also evaluated, with results indicating notable efficiency and practical viability in post-quantum cryptographic applications.</description>

Abstract: We study sequences of modular representations of the symplectic and special linear groups over finite fields obtained from the first homology of congruence subgroups of mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, and the module of coinvariants for the abelianization of the Torelli group. In all cases we compute the composition factors and multiplicities for these representations, and obtain periodic representation stability results in the sense of Church--Farb.</description>

Abstract: The commuting graph of a group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, two distinct vertices joined if they commute.
  Our purpose in this paper is twofold: we discuss the computational problem of deciding whether a given graph is the commuting graph of a finite group; we give a quasipolynomial algorithm, and a polynomial algorithm for the case when the group is an extra\-special p-group for p an odd prime; we give new results on the question of whether the commuting graph of a given group is a cograph or a chordal graph, two classes of graphs defined by forbidden subgraphs.
  The problems are not unrelated, since there are a number of cases where hard computational problems on graphs are easier when restricted to special classes of graphs; we conjecture that the recognition problem is polynomial for cographs and chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Random quotients of mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove several rigidity properties for random quotients of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, namely whose kernel is normally generated by random walks. Firstly, every automorphism of the corresponding quotient of the curve graph is induced by a mapping class, thus generalising a celebrated theorem of Ivanov's. Next, we show that, if a finitely generated group is quasi-isometric to one such random quotient, then the two groups are weakly commensurable. This uses techniques from the world of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, and indeed in the process we clarify a proof of Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto on the quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups. Finally, we show that the automorphisms groups of our quotients, as well as their abstract commensurators, coincide with the groups themselves. Our results hold for a wider family of quotients, roughly those whose kernel act by sufficiently large translations on the curve graph. This class also includes quotients by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov element.</description>

      <title>On Normal Subgroups of Twisted Chevalley Groups over Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two structure theorems for twisted Chevalley groups $G_\sigma (R)$ over a commutative ring $R$ with unity. The first theorem concerns the normality of $E'_\sigma (R,J)$, the elementary congruence subgroups at level $J$, in the group $G_\sigma (R)$. The second theorem classifies all subgroups of $G_\sigma (R)$ normalized by its elementary subgroup $E'_\sigma (R)$. Along the way, we obtain several interesting results. For instance, when $R$ is a semilocal ring, we show that $G_\sigma(R)$ can be expressed as the (internal) product of $E'_\sigma (R)$ and the maximal torus $T_\sigma (R)$ of $G_\sigma (R)$.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this survey paper, we shall consider the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They may be regarded as analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than some well-known facts regarding these series, we shall prove several new results about the relationship among their terms. We shall also consider the lower central series of skew braces that was defined by Bonatto and Jedli\v{c}ka. As we shall explain, it seems to be the ``correct" analog of the lower central series for skew braces. In relation to this, we shall also discuss the notion of lower central series of ideals that is due to Ballester-Bolinches et al.</description>

      <title>An explicit algorithm for the Higman Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which for any recursive group $G$, given by its effectively enumerable generators and recursively enumerable relations, outputs an explicit embedding of $G$ into a finitely presented group directly written by its generators and defining relations. This is the explicit analogue of the remarkable Higman Embedding Theorem stating that a finitely generated group $G$ is embeddable into a finitely presented group if and only if $G$ is recursive. The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, which is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, De la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions and their modifications, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and certain auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to indicate which of its parts are or are not explicit.</description>

      <title>Quantitative nonembeddability of groups of polynomial growth into uniformly convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and not virtually abelian finitely generated groups of polynomial growth do not quasi-isometrically embed into uniformly convex Banach spaces. We quantify this fact by showing that a ball of radius $r\ge 2$ in the aforementioned groups must incur bilipschitz distortion at least a constant multiple of $(\log r)^{1/q}$ into a $q(\ge 2)$-uniformly convex Banach space. This bound is sharp for the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces. We prove this by establishing ``vertical versus horizontal inequalities'' for functions from the aforementioned groups into uniformly convex spaces, using the vector-valued Littlewood--Paley--Stein theory approach of Lafforgue and Naor (2012). These inequalities are quantitative nonembeddability statements that any Lipschitz mapping from the aforementioned groups into a uniformly convex space quantitatively collapses along certain central subgroups.
  In the special case of mappings of Carnot groups into the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces, we prove that the quantitative collapse occurs on the commutator subgroup; this is in line with the qualitative Pansu--Semmes nonembeddability argument given by Cheeger and Kleiner (2006) and Lee and Naor (2006). We prove this by establishing a version of the classical Dorronsoro theorem on Carnot groups. Previously, in the setting of Heisenberg groups, F\"assler and Orponen (2019) established a one-sided Dorronsoro theorem with a restriction $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ on the range of exponents $\alpha$ of the Laplacian; this restriction does not appear in the commutative setting and is caused by their use of horizontal polynomials as approximants. We identify the correct class of approximant polynomials and prove the two-sided Dorronsoro theorem with the full range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$ of exponents in the general setting of Carnot groups, thus strengthening and extending the work of F\"assler and Orponen.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative topological boundaries and amenable invariant random intermediate subalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of the topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M, \tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace-preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (A, \tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, any $\Gamma$-invariant amenable intermediate subalgebra between $A$ and $\Gamma \ltimes A$ is necessarily a subalgebra of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma) \ltimes A$. By taking $(A, \tau_A) = L^\infty(X, \nu_X)$ for a free pmp action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (X, \nu_X)$, we obtain a similar result for the invariant subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>

      <title>Enveloping Ellis semigroups as compactifications of transformations groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced. Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$ is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Classifying Stein's groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of Stein's groups, which generalize the well-known Higman-Thompson groups. Stein's groups are defined as groups of piecewise linear bijections of an interval with finitely many breakpoints and slopes belonging to specified additive and multiplicative subgroups of the real numbers. Our main result establishes a classification theorem for these groups under the assumptions that the slope group is finitely generated and the additive group has rank at least 2. We achieve this by interpreting Stein's groups as topological full groups of ample groupoids. A central concept in our analysis is the notion of $H^1$-rigidity in the cohomology of groupoids. In the case where the rank of the additive group is 1, we adopt a different approach using attracting elements to impose strong constraints on the classification.</description>

      <title>Invariant subalgebras rigidity for von Neumann algebras of groups arising as certain semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ISR (von Neumann invariant subalgebra rigidity) property for certain discrete groups arising as semidirect products from algebraic actions on certain 2-torsion groups, mostly arising as direct products of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We present, in particular, the first example of an amenable group with the ISR property that admits a non-trivial abelian normal subgroup. Several other examples are discussed, notably including an infinite amenable group whose von Neumann algebra admits precisely one invariant von Neumann subalgebra which does not come from a normal subgroup. We also investigate the form of invariant subalgebras of the group von Neumann algebra of the standard lamplighter group.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of the Standard Model in $E_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a modified version of the Manogue-Dray-Wilson `octions' model of elementary particles, that overcomes some of the objections to that model that have been raised. In particular, I restore the compactness of the Standard Model gauge group, and show how the symmetry-breaking of the weak $SU(2)$ relates to the symmetry-breaking between the three generations of elementary fermions.
  In the process of attempting to implement a Dirac equation for three generations of fermions simultaneously, it turns out that some parts of the $E_8$ model are not required for the Standard Model, which is entirely contained in the subalgebra $\mathfrak{so}(7,3)$. In particular a re-interpretation of the Dirac spinors allows us to interpret part of the model as quantum gravity, which is then compared to General Relativity. The general structure of the model shows that the mixing angles depend on masses, and that the masses emerge from quantum interactions with the dynamic background spacetime (vacuum). Some sample calculations are given to support these predictions.</description>
