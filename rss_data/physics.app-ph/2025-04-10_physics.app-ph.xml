      <title>A Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface With Surface-Wave Assisted Beamforming Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of tunability mechanisms in the metasurface design has unleashed a tremendous potential for wireless communications. In particular, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can manipulate the reflections of an incident electromagnetic wave at will, based on the real-time conditions, with the aim of enhancing communication links. In this paper, we develop an RIS at C band that operates with a transverse-electric (TE) polarization and can shape the radiation pattern at a single plane with high-accuracy, in addition to the more conventional beamsteering functionalities. The beamforming is facilitated by subwavelength unit cells that allow the excitation of auxiliary surface waves in the vicinity of the RIS. Importantly, these evanescent fields are predicted and harnessed through an integral-equation framework used for the analysis and optimization of the RIS. A fabricated prototype demonstrates beamsteering up to 60 degrees with an average illumination efficiency of 95% and sector patterns with a varying beamwidth (ranging from 30 degrees to 60 degrees) that verify the full-wave simulations. Lastly, losses are predicted and constrained during the optimization stage leading to solutions with relatively high power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast and Directional Magnetization Control via Voltage-Controlled Exchange Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving ultrafast and energy-efficient magnetization switching is essential for next-generation spintronic devices. Voltage-driven switching offers a promising alternative to current-based approaches. Although voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) has been proposed to steer magnetic states, its ultrafast response and role in polarity selection have not been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate that VCEC induces a directional exchange field that persists under nanosecond voltage pulses in a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) with an exchange-coupled free layer. This confirms that VCEC can operate on ultrafast timescales and deterministically select the switching polarity. The reversal is primarily assisted by voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), which transiently lowers the energy barrier. This combination enables magnetization switching within 87.5 ps with 50% switching probability and 100 ps with 94% switching probability, respectively. The observed fast switching is enabled in part by enhanced angular momentum dissipation in the exchange-coupled structure, which increases effective damping and accelerates relaxation. These findings reveal a purely voltage-driven and dynamically viable route for fast, directional control of magnetization-positioning VCEC as a key functional mechanism for future spintronic logic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics of GHz acoustic waves in chipscale phononic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic integrated circuits, which manipulate GHz-frequency acoustic fields in {\mu}m-scale waveguides, provide new degrees of freedom for routing and manipulation of microwaves in deeply sub-wavelength geometries with associated implications for chipscale sensing and signal processing. The combination of low propagation loss, long interaction lengths and slow speed of sound put together with the large measurement bandwidths and high frequency resolution available from modern vector network analyzers (VNA) makes it feasible to visualize the temporal dynamics of propagating acoustic fields in these devices and see the device in action. Two representative examples we discuss here are pulse circulation and ringdown in an acoustic microring resonator, and the observation of (parasitic) multipath interference effects in waveguide resonator geometries. In the absence of fast 3D acoustic field imaging modalities, such time domain reflectometry based methods provide the best alternative for mapping interface reflection and loss, which becomes increasingly critical as these devices start to scale in complexity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced cooling via self-Kerr nonlinearity in cavity-magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling massive oscillators to quantum ground state is a key step for their precise control and quantum application. Recent work found that the center-of-mass motion of a levitated magnetic sphere can be cooled via magnon-cavity coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that a enhanced cooling can be realized by exploiting self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnon mode, observed in a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. By means of proper pump driving, the self-Kerr nonlinearity is mapped into degenerate magnon squeezing, leading to considerable enhancement of cooling via optimizing system parameters. Moreover, this Kerr nonlinear effect also brings enhanced cooling in the sideband-unresolved regime where the mechanical frequency is smaller than the cavity decay rate. These results provide new way to quantum technologies in terms of storage schemes and ultrasensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a key technology for next-generation communication, offering real-time and dynamic control over electromagnetic wave characteristics. The scattering of an RIS unit cell can be effectively modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a lumped RLC-loaded metasurface. However, existing ECMs, particularly those with square patches, often fail to generalize beyond specific configurations or integrate lumped elements, limiting their practical applicability to single polarization or normal incidence. In this work, we propose a simple yet robust ECM that accurately predicts the spectral response while maintaining adaptability across varying design parameters, including polarization, arbitrary angles of incidence, and physical dimensions of lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from a 1x1 unit cell as the fundamental structure and extending to 2x1 and 2x2 cell configurations. The 2x2 cell structure allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in dual independent polarizations. These capabilities facilitate the realization of vector holographic metasurfaces. Validation with full-wave simulations demonstrates strong agreement, highlighting the efficiency and robustness of our model. This work lays the foundation for simplified and effective RIS modeling and optimization in advanced communication systems.</description>

      <title>Isolator-Free Laser Operation Enabled by Chip-Scale Reflections in Zero-Process-Change SOI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isolation-free operation of photonic integrated circuits enables dense integration, reducing packaging costs and complexity. Most isolator replacements require a change in the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) foundry process and suffer from large insertion loss. Most solutions did not integrate the laser, leaving the verification incomplete, and measurements with modulated reflections have also been missing. In this work, we present, for the first time, a zero-process-change silicon photonic (SiP) circuit that, when paired with an integrated distributed-feedback laser (DFB), enhances the DFB's immunity to continuous-wave and modulated parasitic reflections from multiple reflectors. The circuit generates intentional, controlled self-injection to stabilize laser dynamics and maintain operation. The SiP circuit is complemented by an electro-optic feedback loop that dynamically adjusts the self-injection to preserve laser stability. The proposed circuit introduces an insertion loss of 1.5 dB and enables the DFB laser to tolerate back reflections as large as -7 dB and -12 dB from on-chip and off-chip reflectors, respectively. The DFB is hybrid integrated with the SiP chip using a photonic wire bond (PWB). The isolator-free operation of the integrated laser in a high-speed optical link has been demonstrated, highlighting its potential for data communication applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Optical Modulation and Control at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Revealing Modeshape Complexity and Sensitivity in Torsional Vibrations of Microcantilevers with Overhang- and T-shaped Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The torsional vibration of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers is critical for high-sensitivity measurements, yet existing models for width-varying cantilevers often rely on approximations that lead to significant discrepancies with experimental data. Unlike prior studies, this work introduces a refined analytical framework to precisely compute resonance frequencies and mode shapes, including higher-order modes, for overhang- and T-shaped microcantilevers, validated through targeted experimental comparisons. By systematically analyzing the effects of overhang length, we reveal previously unreported multi-maxima mode shapes and demonstrate how geometric tuning can controllably shift resonant frequencies. Furthermore, we establish a quantitative relationship between modal sensitivity and cantilever-surface coupling strength, providing actionable design principles for optimizing AFM cantilever performance. Our results not only reconcile theoretical predictions with experimental observations but also offer practical guidelines for tailoring cantilever geometry to achieve specific frequency responses in applications such as nanomechanical imaging and surface property mapping. This work advances the design of next-generation AFM probes by bridging the gap between analytical models and real-world operational demands.</description>

      <title>Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for Laplace's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>
