      <title>Isotropic Remeshing with Inter-Angle Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important metric for mesh quality evaluation, the isotropy property holds significant value for applications such as texture UV-mapping, physical simulation, and discrete geometric analysis. Classical isotropy remeshing methods adjust vertices and edge lengths, which exhibit certain limitations in terms of input data sensitivity, geometric consistency control, and convergence speed. In this paper, we propose an improved isotropy remeshing solution with inter-angle optimization during mesh editing to enhance shape control capability and accelerate convergence. The advantage of the solution lies in its ability to predict the impact of edge length adjustments on subsequent optimization by monitoring angle transformations. It avoids inefficient editing that may cause performance fluctuations, thereby improving efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the overall efficiency of mesh optimization.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algorithms for Potts lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus. Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.</description>

      <title>Faithful Reeb Graph Reconstruction of a Tectonic Subduction Zone from Earthquake Hypocenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important problem in topological data analysis (TDA)$\unicode{x2014}$of both theoretical and practical interest$\unicode{x2014}$is to reconstruct the topology and geometry of an underlying (usually unknown) metric graph from possibly noisy data sampled around it. Reeb graphs have recently been successfully employed in abstract metric graph reconstruction under Gromov$\unicode{x2013}$Hausdorff noise: the sample is assumed to be metrically close to the ground truth. However, such a strong global density guarantee is often unavailable, making the existing Reeb graph-based methods unusable. A very different yet more relevant paradigm focuses on the reconstruction of metric graphs$\unicode{x2014}$embedded in the Euclidean space$\unicode{x2014}$from Euclidean samples that are only Hausdorff-close. We relax the density assumption to give provable geometric reconstruction schemes, even when the sample is metrically close only locally, but still provide provable guarantees for the successful geometric reconstruction of Euclidean graphs under the Hausdorff noise model.
  We apply our graph reconstruction techniques to reconstruct earthquake plate tectonic boundaries from the global earthquake catalog. The SLAB2.0 model is a comprehensive spatial summary of all known subduction zone slabs on Earth. We reconstruct parts of the SLAB2.0 model from possibly noisy earthquake hypocenter data.</description>

      <title>A Discrete Analog of Tutte's Barycentric Embeddings on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tutte's celebrated barycentric embedding theorem describes a natural way to build straight-line embeddings (crossing-free drawings) of a (3-connected) planar graph: map the vertices of the outer face to the vertices of a convex polygon, and ensure that each remaining vertex is in convex position, namely, a barycenter with positive coefficients of its neighbors. Actually computing an embedding then boils down to solving a system of linear equations. A particularly appealing feature of this method is the flexibility given by the choice of the barycentric weights. Generalizations of Tutte's theorem to surfaces of nonpositive curvature are known, but due to their inherently continuous nature, they do not lead to an algorithm.
  In this paper, we propose a purely discrete analog of Tutte's theorem for surfaces (with or without boundary) of nonpositive curvature, based on the recently introduced notion of reducing triangulations. We prove a Tutte theorem in this setting: every drawing homotopic to an embedding such that each vertex is harmonious (a discrete analog of being in convex position) is a weak embedding (arbitrarily close to an embedding). We also provide a polynomial-time algorithm to make an input drawing harmonious without increasing the length of any edge, in a similar way as a drawing can be put in convex position without increasing the edge lengths.</description>
