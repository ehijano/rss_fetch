      <title>EcoEdgeTwin: Enhanced 6G Network via Mobile Edge Computing and Digital Twin Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 6G era, integrating Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies presents a transformative approach to enhance network performance through predictive, adaptive control for energy-efficient, low-latency communication. This paper presents the EcoEdgeTwin model, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy between MEC and DT technologies to ensure efficient network operation. We optimize the utility function within the EcoEdgeTwin model to balance enhancing users' Quality of Experience (QoE) and minimizing latency and energy consumption at edge servers. This approach ensures efficient and adaptable network operations, utilizing DT to synchronize and integrate real-time data seamlessly.
  Our framework achieves this by implementing robust mechanisms for task offloading, service caching, and cost-effective service migration. Additionally, it manages energy consumption related to task processing, communication, and the influence of DT predictions, all essential for optimizing latency and minimizing energy usage.
  Through the utility model, we also prioritize QoE, fostering a user-centric approach to network management that balances network efficiency with user satisfaction. A cornerstone of our approach is integrating the advantage actor-critic algorithm, marking a pioneering use of deep reinforcement learning for dynamic network management. This strategy addresses challenges in service mobility and network variability, ensuring optimal network performance matrices. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that compared to benchmark models lacking DT integration, EcoEdgeTwin framework significantly reduces energy usage and latency while enhancing QoE.</description>

      <title>Protocols to Code: Formal Verification of a Next-Generation Internet Router</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first formally-verified Internet router, which is part of the SCION Internet architecture. SCION routers run a cryptographic protocol for secure packet forwarding in an adversarial environment. We verify both the protocol's network-wide security properties and low-level properties of its implementation. More precisely, we develop a series of protocol models by refinement in Isabelle/HOL and we use an automated program verifier to prove that the router's Go code satisfies memory safety, crash freedom, freedom from data races, and adheres to the protocol model. Both verification efforts are soundly linked together. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of coherently verifying a critical network component from high-level protocol models down to performance-optimized production code, developed by an independent team. In the process, we uncovered critical bugs in both the protocol and its implementation, which were confirmed by the code developers, and we strengthened the protocol's security properties. This paper explains our approach, summarizes the main results, and distills lessons for the design and implementation of verifiable systems, for the handling of continuous changes, and for the verification techniques and tools employed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Secure Anonymous Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) enable Internet browsing in a way that prevents the accessed content from being traced back to the user. This allows a high level of privacy, protecting individuals from being tracked by advertisers or governments, for example. The Tor network, a prominent example of such a network, uses a layered encryption scheme to encapsulate data packets, using Tor nodes to obscure the routing process before the packets enter the public Internet. While Tor is capable of providing substantial privacy, its encryption relies on schemes, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman for distributing symmetric keys, which are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks and are currently in the process of being phased out.
  To overcome the threat, we propose a quantum-resistant alternative to RSA and Diffie-Hellman for distributing symmetric keys, namely, quantum key distribution (QKD). Standard QKD networks depend on trusted nodes to relay keys across long distances, however, reliance on trusted nodes in the quantum network does not meet the criteria necessary for establishing a Tor circuit in the ACN. We address this issue by developing a protocol and network architecture that integrates QKD without the need for trusted nodes, thus meeting the requirements of the Tor network and creating a quantum-secure anonymous communication network.</description>

      <title>DYST (Did You See That?): An Amplified Covert Channel That Points To Previously Seen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covert channels are stealthy communication channels that enable manifold adversary and legitimate scenarios, ranging from stealthy malware communications to the exchange of confidential information by journalists.
  We present DYST, which represents a new class of covert channels we call history covert channels jointly with the new paradigm of covert channel amplification.
  All covert channels described until now need to craft seemingly legitimate flows or need to modify third-party flows, mimicking unsuspicious behavior. In contrast, history covert channels can communicate by pointing to unaltered legitimate traffic created by regular network nodes. Only a negligible fraction of the covert communication process requires the transfer of actual covert channel information by the covert channel's sender. This information can be sent through different protocols/channels. This allows an amplification of the covert channel's message size, i.e., minimizing the fraction of actually transferred secret data by a covert channel's sender in relation to the overall secret data being exchanged. Further, we extend the current taxonomy for covert channels to show how history channels can be categorized.
  We describe multiple scenarios in which history covert channels can be realized, analyze the characteristics of these channels, and show how their configuration can be optimized.</description>
