      <title>Thermodynamics of Sodium-Lead Alloys for Negative Electrodes from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals, such as tin, antimony, and lead (Pb) have garnered renewed attention for their potential use as alloyant-negative electrode materials in sodium (Na)-ion batteries (NIBs). Despite Pb's toxicity and its high molecular weight, lead is one of the most commonly recycled metals, positioning Pb as a promising candidate for a cost-effective, high-capacity anode material. Understanding the miscibility of Na into Pb is crucial for the development of high-energy density negative electrode materials for NIBs. Using a first-principles multiscale approach, we analyze the thermodynamic properties and estimate the Na-alloying voltage of the Na-Pb system by constructing the compositional phase diagram. In the Pb-Na system, we elucidate the phase boundaries of important phases, such as Pb-rich face-centered cubic and $\beta$-NaPb$_3$, thereby improving our understanding of the phase diagram of the Na-Pb alloy. Due to the strong ordering tendencies of the Na-Pb intermetallics (such as NaPb, Na$_5$Pb$_2$, and Na$_{15}$Pb$_4$), we do not observe any solid-solution behavior at intermediate and high Na concentrations.</description>

      <title>3D reconstruction of a million atoms by multiple-section local-orbital tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two groups of electron microscopy methods that are capable of providing three-dimensional (3D) structural information of an object, i.e., electron tomography and depth sectioning. Electron tomography is capable of resolving atoms in all three dimensions, but the accuracy in atomic positions is low and the object size that can be reconstructed is limited. Depth sectioning methods give high positional accuracy in the imaging plane, but the spatial resolution in the third dimension is low. In this work, electron tomography and depth sectioning are combined to form a method called multiple-section local-orbital tomography, or nLOT in short. The nLOT method provides high spatial resolution and high positional accuracy in all three dimensions. The object size that can be reconstructed is extended to a million atoms. The present method establishes a foundation for the widespread application of atomic electron tomography.</description>

      <title>Gain-loss-engineering: a new platform for extreme anisotropic thermal photon tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel approach to achieving anisotropic thermal photon tunneling, inspired by the concept of parity-time symmetry in quantum physics. Our method leverages the modulation of constitutive optical parameters, oscillating between loss and gain regimes. This modulation reveals a variety of distinct effects in thermal photon behavior and dispersion. Specifically, we identify complex tunneling modes through gain-loss engineering, which include thermal photonic defect states and Fermi-arc-like phenomena, which surpass those achievable through traditional polariton engineering. Our research also elucidates the laws governing the evolution of radiative energy in the presence of gain and loss interactions, and highlights the unexpected inefficacy of gain in enhancing thermal photon energy transport compared to systems characterized solely by loss. This study not only broadens our understanding of thermal photon tunneling but also establishes a versatile platform for manipulating photon energy transport, with potential applications in thermal management, heat science, and the development of advanced energy devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of crystal symmetries and Weyl nodes on high-harmonic generation in Weyl semimetal TaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) offers an all-optical approach to discern structural symmetries through its selection rules and probe topological phases with its spectral signatures. Here we develop a universal theoretical framework -- the Jones matrix formalism -- establishing the fundamental relationship between pulse-crystal shared symmetries and HHG selection rules. Applying this to the Weyl semimetal (WSM) material TaAs, shows that the anomalous harmonics excited by linearly and circularly polarized pulses are governed respectively by the shared twofold and fourfold rotational symmetries of laser pulses and lattice, rather than the topology of Weyl nodes. The common observables of HHG, including intensity, circular dichroism, ellipticity dependence, and carrier-envelope phase dependence, are not found to carry a signature of the Weyl cones. This insight into TaAs can be extended to other WSMs, indicating that HHG is not a particularly effective tool for investigating the topological features of WSMs. However, the Jones matrix formalism lays the groundwork for both HHG probing crystal symmetry and controlling harmonic polarization states.</description>

      <title>Active oversight and quality control in standard Bayesian optimization for autonomous experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fusion of experimental automation and machine learning has catalyzed a new era in materials research, prominently featuring Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization (GPBO) driven autonomous experiments navigating complex experimental conditions for accelerated scientific discovery. In traditional GPBO-driven experiments, a predefined scalarizer function is often required to preprocess the experimental data, transforming non-scalar raw data into scalar descriptors for GP training. However, such predefined scalarizer functions have limitations, which likely fail to accommodate the diversity and complexity of real-world experimental data, potentially skewing experimental outcomes. Thus, oversight and quality control are necessitated over the process to avoid GPBO from being misled by low quality scalarizers. To address the limitation, we introduce a Dual-GP approach that enhances traditional GPBO by adding a secondary surrogate model to dynamically constrain the experimental space based on real-time assessments of the raw experimental data. This Dual-GP approach enhances the optimization efficiency of traditional GPBO by isolating more promising space for BO sampling and more valuable experimental data for primary GP training. We also incorporate a flexible, human-in-the-loop intervention method in the Dual-GP workflow to adjust for unanticipated results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Dual-GP model with synthetic model data and implement this approach in autonomous pulsed laser deposition experimental data. This Dual-GP approach has broad applicability in diverse GPBO-driven experimental settings, providing a more adaptable and precise framework for refining autonomous experimentation for more efficient optimization.</description>

      <title>Pros and cons of structural chirality measurements and computation of handedness in periodic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the various chirality measures most widely used in the literature to quantify chiral symmetry in extended solids, i.e., the continuous chirality measure, the Hausdorff distance, and the angular momentum. By studying these functions in an algebraically tractable case, we can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses when applied to more complex crystals. Going beyond those classical calculations, we propose a new method to quantify the handedness of a crystal based on a pseudoscalar function, i.e., the helicity. This quantity, borrowed from hydrodynamics, can be computed from the eigenvector carrying the system from the high-symmetry non-chiral phase to the low-symmetry chiral phase. Different model systems like K$_3$NiO$_2$, CsCuCl$_3$ and MgTi$_2$O$_4$ are used as test cases where we show the superior interest of using helicity to quantify chirality together with the handedness distinction.</description>

      <title>The strain-stress relationships for coherent in-plane strain in heterostructures with monoclinic crystal systems: $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ on $(h0l)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive the state of strain or stress under symmetry conserving conditions in pseudomorphic lattices with monoclinic symmetry. We compare surface vectors across the template epitaxial layer interface and impose conditions of a stress free epitaxial layer. As a result, we demonstrate the existence, in theory, of exactly three possible unit cells which can establish onto a given template. We demonstrate this approach for a class of templates with $(h0l)$ planes and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ on $(h0l)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. We discuss the effects of composition $x$ and surface orientation onto the formation of three elastically stable unit cells, their strain and stress tensors, unit cell axes, unit cell volumes, lattice spacing, elastic potential energies, and stress free directions. The previous paradigm for epitaxial layer growth where the stress free direction is always perpendicular to the growing surface is not generally valid for low symmetry materials. In the example here, we find two possible competing domains with stress free direction oblique to the surface of the template for almost all planes $(h0l)$. We calculate the band-to-band transitions for $\beta$-(Al$_{0.1}$Ga$_{0.9}$)$_2$O$_3$ on $(h0l)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using the composition dependent deformation parameters and elastic coefficients reported prevoiously [Korlacki~\textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Appl.~\textbf{18}, 064019 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Engineering liquid-liquid interfaces for high-entropy alloy synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) with various promising applications have attracted significant interest. However, alloying immiscible metal elements while controlling the morphology and crystallinity remains extremely challenging. We report a general route, by engineering liquid-liquid interfaces, for the synthesis of HEAs with controlled crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal, amorphous), morphology (0-dimension, 2-dimension, 3-dimension), and high composition diversity (20 elements) under mild conditions (room temperature to 80 degrees celsius). As reactions can be spatially confined at the liquid-liquid interface, it provides an opportunity to control the kinetics and reduce the alloying temperature. Our real-time observation of the alloying of HEAs reveals hydrogen-enhanced mixing and isothermal solidification that kinetically traps the mixing states due to composition changes. The concept of liquid-liquid interface engineering can be applied to obtain other high-entropy compounds.</description>

      <title>Prediction of induced magnetism in 2D Ti$_2$C based MXene by manipulating the mixed surface functionalization and metal substitution computed by xTB model Hamiltonian of the DFTB method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the recently developed density functional tight binding (DFTB) method's Hamiltonian, GFN1-xTB, for modeling the mixed termination in Ti$_{{\rm2}}$C MXene, namely three types of termination by combining -O and -OH, -O and -F, as well as -F and -OH. We demonstrated that the approach yields reliable predictions for electronic and magnetic properties of such MXenes. The first highlighted result is that the mixed surface functionalization in Ti$_{{\rm2}}$CA$_{{\rm x}}$B$_{{\rm y}}$ MXene induces spin polarization with diverse magnetic alignments, including ferromagnetism and two types of antiferromagnetism. We further identified the magnetic alignment for the investigated MXene in terms of the compositions of the terminal groups. Moreover, the effect of the transition metal (Ti) substituted by the Sc atom on the electronic and magnetic properties were also investigated. We found that the studied systems maintain the magnetism and the metallic characteristics. A magnetic transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic (FiM) ordering was found for ScTi$_{{\rm15}}$C$_{{\rm8}}$F$_{{\rm8}}$(OH)$_{{\rm8}}$ and ScTi$_{{\rm15}}$C$_{{\rm8}}$F$_{{\rm12}}$(OH)$_{{\rm4}}$ compounds. Finally, we proved that incorporating the Sc atom into the lattice of Ti$_{{\rm2}}$CO$_{{\rm2}}$ and mixed surface termination Ti$_{{\rm2}}$CA$_{{\rm x}}$B$_{{\rm y}}$ is an effective strategy to induce magnetism. Our study may provide a new potential application for designing MXene-based spintronics.</description>

      <title>Crystal facet orientation and temperature dependence of charge and spin Hall effects in noncollinear antiferromagnet: A first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (nc-AFMs) have attracted increasing research attention in spintronics due to their unique spin structures and fascinating charge and spin transport properties. By using first-principles calculations, we comprehensively investigate the charge and spin Hall effects in representative noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Pt. Our study reveals that the Hall effects in nc-AFMs are critically dependent on the crystal facet orientation and temperature. For (001) orientated Mn3Pt, each charge and spin Hall conductivity element is comprised of both time reversal odd (T-odd) and even (T-even) contribution, associated with longitudinal conductivity, which leads to sizable and highly anisotropic Hall conductivity. The temperature dependence of charge and spin Hall conductivity has been elucidated by considering both phonon and spin disorder scattering. The scaling relations between Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity have also been investigated. The existence of prominent spin Hall effect in nc-AFMs may generate spin current with Sz spin polarization, which is advantageous for field free switching of perpendicular magnetization. Our work may provide unambiguous understanding on the charge and spin transport in noncollinear antiferromagnets and pave their way for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic and Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional Diboron-Porphyrin by Strain Engineering: A Density Functional Theory Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have carried out DFT simulations to investigate the electronic and optical properties of a porphyrin-based 2D crystal named 2D Diboron-Porphyrin (2DDP). We showed that it is possible to use strain to tune the 2DDP electronic properties (from semiconductor to metal) depending on the direction of the applied strain. 2DDP exhibits optical activity from the infrared to the ultraviolet region. Similarly to electronic bands, strain can also modulate the optical activity response. 2DDP can be a promising candidate for some electro-opto-mechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of Reactivity Parameters, UV-Vis and IR Spectra, NLO Properties, and Temperature-Dependent Thermodynamic Characteristics of Schiff-Based Interdigitated 5O.m (m=14,16) Liquid Crystalline Compounds: A DFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article studies the different physical, vibrational, nonlinear optical, and thermodynamical properties of higher homologs 5O.m (m = 14,16) liquid crystalline compounds using density functional theory. The optimized structure of 5O.m (m= 14,16) liquid crystals was obtained by using density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional and standard basis set 6-31G (d, p). The Infrared spectra (IR), various physical properties such as HOMO-LUMO, nonlinear optical properties (NLO), reactivity parameters, relative energy gaps, and electrostatic potential function are computed and analyzed using the optimized structure of 5O liquid crystal. The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been used to analyze and obtain UV-Vis spectra for both LC compounds. It is observed that the 5O.m (m=14,16) liquid crystals are showing the lower value of HOMO-LUMO energy gaps as 4.17ev which resulted in some highly fascinating optical and physical properties. Using DFT excellent agreement is observed between all spectrum patterns and the simulated UV-Vis and IR spectra. This article, however, also discussed temperature-dependent thermodynamical properties such as zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE), total thermal energy, total specific heat capacity, rotational constants, and total entropy which enable us to understand the phase transition behavior and specific transition temperatures of different phases</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic and Optical Properties of Impurity-Engineered Two-Dimensional Graphullerene Half-Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel material consisting of a monolayer of C$_{60}$ buckyballs with hexagonal symmetry has recently been observed experimentally, named graphullerene. In this study, we present a comprehensive \textit{ab-initio} theoretical analysis of the electronic and optical properties of both pristine and impurity-engineered monolayer graphullerene using spin-dependent density functional theory (spin-DFT). Our findings reveal that graphullerene is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of approximately 1.5 eV at the $\Gamma$ point, agreeing well with experimental data. Notably, we demonstrate that by adding impurities, in particular substitutional nitrogen, substitutional boron, or adsorbent hydrogen, to graphullerene results in the formation of spin-dependent deep donor and deep acceptor levels, thereby giving rise to a variety of half-semiconductors. All the impurities exhibit a magnetic moment of approximately $\mu_B$ per impurity. This impurity engineering enables the tuning of spin-polarized exciton properties in graphullerene, with spin-dependent band gap energies ranging from 0.43 eV ($\lambda \sim$ 2.9 $\mu$m) to 1.5 eV ($\lambda \sim$ 820 nm), covering the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) regimes. Our results suggest that both pristine and impurity-engineered graphullerene have significant potential for the development of carbon-based 2D semiconductor spintronic and opto-spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Superionic surface Li-ion transport in carbonaceous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike Li-ion transport in the bulk of carbonaceous materials, little is known about Li-ion diffusion on their surface. In this study, we have discovered an ultra-fast Li-ion transport phenomenon on the surface of carbonaceous materials, particularly when they have limited Li insertion capacity along with a high surface area. This is exemplified by a carbon black, Ketjen Black (KB). An ionic conductivity of 18.1 mS cm-1 at room temperature is observed, far exceeding most solid-state ion conductors. Theoretical calculations reveal a low diffusion barrier for the surface Li species. The species is also identified as Li*, which features a partial positive charge. As a result, lithiated KB functions effectively as an interlayer between Li and solid-state electrolytes (SSE) to mitigate dendrite growth and cell shorting. This function is found to be electrolyte agnostic, effective for both sulfide and halide SSEs. Further, lithiated KB can act as a high-performance mixed ion/electron conductor that is thermodynamically stable at potentials near Li metal. A graphite anode mixed with KB instead of a solid electrolyte demonstrates full utilization with a capacity retention of ~85% over 300 cycles. The discovery of this surface-mediated ultra-fast Li-ion transport mechanism provides new directions for the design of solid-state ion conductors and solid-state batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiferroic properties of TbMnO3 demonstrate high versatility under applied pressure, making the material potentially suitable for use in flexible electronics. Here, we report on the preparation of elastic freestanding TbMnO3 membranes with dominant (001) or (010) crystallographic out-of-plane orientation. Membranes with thickness of 20 nm display orthorhombic bulk-like relaxed lattice parameters with strong suppression of twinning for the (010) oriented membranes. Strain in flexible membranes was tuned by using a commercial strain cell device and characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The B1g out-of-phase oxygen-stretching mode, representative for the Mn-O bond distance, systematically shifts to lower energy with increasing strain (epsilon{max} ~ 0.5 %). The flexibility and elastic properties of the membranes allow for specific manipulation of the multiferroic state by strain, whereas the choice of the crystallographic orientation gives possibility for an in- or out-of-plane electric polarization.</description>

      <title>Effect of Halogen Substituents on Charge Transport Properties of n-type Organic Semiconductors: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have received much attention as promising materials for electronic devices. In this study, we investigate the impact of halogen groups on the charge transport properties of n-type OSC-6,13 bis ((triisopropylsilyl) ethynyl)-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene (TIPS-TAP). The computed mobilities for TAPs substituted with F and Cl exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental values, while the simulation overestimates the electron mobility for TAP. Interestingly, the mobility of TIPS-TAP-4F is significantly lower than that of TIPS-TAP-4Cl/Br, despite their similar packing structures. This discrepancy can be attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluoride, leading to reduced electron transfer integrals and increased reorganization energy. While molecular packing is widely accepted as a dominant factor in charge transport in OSCs, our study highlights the essential role of electronic effects in OSC charge transport. This study provides new insights into the understanding of the charge transport mechanism in OSCs.</description>

      <title>Element-specific ultrafast lattice dynamics in monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monolayer WSe2 using ultrafast electron diffraction. We introduce an approach to quantitatively extract atomic-site-specific information, providing an element-specific view of incoherent atomic vibrations following femtosecond excitation. Via differences between W and Se vibrations, we identify stages in the nonthermal evolution of the lattice. Combined with a calculated phonon dispersion, this element specificity enables us to identify a long-lasting overpopulation of specific optical phonons, and to interpret the stages as energy transfer processes between specific phonon groups. These results demonstrate the appeal of resolving element-specific vibrational information in the ultrafast time domain.</description>

      <title>Brightened Optical Transition as Indicator of Multiferroicity in a Layered Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets show strong interconnection between their electrical, magnetic, and structural properties. Here we reveal the emergence of a luminescent transition upon crossing the N\'eel transition temperature of CrPS$_4$, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. This luminescent transition occurs above the lowest absorption level. We attribute the optical transitions to excited states of the t$_{\rm 2g}$ orbitals of the Cr$^{3+}$ ions, which are influenced by the distortion of the octahedral crystal field. Specifically, we find at the crossing of the N\'eel temperature changes the distortion from an anti-polar to polar arrangement, thereby not only activating an additional luminescent pathway but also inducing a significant in-plane static dipole moment detected by a marked enhancement in the intensity of the second harmonic generation. Our findings suggest the presence of a multiferroic state in CrPS$_4$ below the N\'eel temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tissue engineering, 3D scaffolds and chemical treatments are often used for providing a cell-friendly surface for improving cell adhesion and tissue growth. Indeed, the cell adhesion degree can be controlled by physical-chemical changes in the surface of substrates, such as wettability, surface charges and roughness. In this work, we describe the synthesis, characterization and cytocompatibility of photoresins useful for construction of cell scaffolds via two-photon polymerization. Additionally, we have demonstrated a simple surface treatment method that promotes cell adhesion. This method alters the surface charge of the polymer and enhances the adhesion of epithelial cells. Our results indicate an efficient approach for modifying the surface of biocompatible polymer scaffolds with the purpose of enhances the performance of cell functions suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetism in Nitride MXenes:consequences of atomic layer stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations to investigate the effects of stacking patterns on the electronic and magnetic properties of several Nitride MXenes. MXenes, a relatively new addition to the family of two-dimensional materials, have exhibited fascinating properties on several occasions, primarily due to their compositional flexibility. However, compared to Carbide MXenes, Nitride MXenes are much less explored. Moreover, the structural aspects of MXenes and the tunability it may offer have not been explored until recently. In this work, we have combined these two less-explored aspects to examine the structure-property relations in the field of magnetism. We find that in the family of M$_{2}$NT$_{2}$ (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn; T=O, F) MXenes, the stacking of transition metal planes has a substantial effect on the ground state and finite temperature magnetic properties. We also find that the electronic ground states can be tuned by changing the stacking pattern in these compounds, making the materials appropriate for applications as magnetic devices. Through a detailed analysis, we have connected the unconventional stacking pattern-driven tunability of these compounds with regard to electronic and magnetic properties to the local symmetry, inhomogeneity (or lack of it) of structural parameters, and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Charge Transport and Defects in Sulfur-Deficient Chalcogenide Perovskite BaZrS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the conduction mechanism in the chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$ is of significant interest due to its potential suitability as a top absorber layer in silicon-based tandem solar cells and other optoelectronic applications. Theoretical and experimental studies anticipate native ambipolar doping in BaZrS$_3$, although experimental validation remains limited. This study reveals a transition from highly insulating behavior to n-type conductivity in BaZrS$_3$ through annealing in an S-poor environment. BaZrS$_3$ thin films are synthesized $\textit{via}$ a two step process: co-sputtering of Ba-Zr followed by sulfurization at 600 $^{\circ}$C, and subsequent annealing in high vacuum. UV-Vis measurement reveal a red-shift in the absorption edge concurrent with sample color darkening after annealing. The increase in defect density with vacuum annealing, coupled with low activation energy and n-type character of defects, strongly suggests that sulfur vacancies (V$_{\mathrm{S}}$) are responsible, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The shift of the Fermi level towards conduction band minimum, quantified by Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (Ga K$\alpha$, 9.25 keV), further corroborates the induced n-type of conductivity in annealed samples. Our findings indicate that vacuum annealing induces V$_{\mathrm{S}}$ defects that dominate the charge transport, thereby making BaZrS$_3$ an n-type semiconductor under S-poor conditions. This study offers crucial insights into understanding the defect properties of BaZrS$_3$, facilitating further improvements for its use in solar cell applications.</description>

      <title>Controllable Deformations in Compressible Isotropic Implicit Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given material, \emph{controllable deformations} are those deformations that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and by applying only boundary tractions. For a given class of materials, \emph{universal deformations} are those deformations that are controllable for any material within the class. In this paper, we characterize the universal deformations in compressible isotropic implicit elasticity defined by solids whose constitutive equations, in terms of the Cauchy stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and the left Cauchy-Green strain $\mathbf{b}$, have the implicit form $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{f}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{b})=\mathbf{0}$. We prove that universal deformations are homogeneous. However, an important observation is that, unlike Cauchy (and Green) elasticity, not every homogeneous deformation is permissible for a given implicit-elastic solid. In other words, the set of universal deformations is material-dependent, yet it remains a subset of homogeneous deformations.</description>

      <title>Muon spin relaxation in mixed perovskite (LaAlO$_3$)$_{x}$(SrAl$_{0.5}$Ta$_{0.5}$O$_3$)$_{1-x}$ with $x\simeq 0.3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on muon spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements in a mixed perovskite compound, (LaAlO$_3$)$_{x}$(SrAl$_{0.5}$Ta$_{0.5}$O$_3$)$_{1-x}$ with $x\simeq 0.3$ (LSAT), which is widely used as a single-crystalline substrate for thin film deposition. In zero applied field (ZF), muon depolarization due to the distribution of nuclear dipole fields was observed in the temperature range from 4 K to 270 K. Interestingly, $\mu^+$SR time spectra in ZF maintained a Gaussian-like feature over the entire range, while the depolarization rate exhibited a monotonic decrease with increasing temperature. This behavior may be attributed to the thermally activated diffusion of muons between a few adjacent sites within a confined space of the angstrom scale, where the motionally averaged local field that each muon experiences can remain non-zero and result in maintaining the Gaussian-like line shape. The spatial distribution of electrostatic potential at lattice interstices evaluated via density functional theory calculations suggests that such a restriction of muon diffusion paths can be caused by the random distribution of cations with different nominal valences in the mixed perovskite lattice.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductors, as one of the most important research directions at present, have attracted much attention because of their potential to realize topological quantum computation. However, a universal computational tool based on first-principle calculations for topological superconductivity was not yet fully developed, and eventually significant challenges in predicting topological superconducting materials. It is difficult to calculate the topological superconducting properties of the system in a self-consistent manner. In this paper, we develop a numerical method to characterize the superconducting band spectrum and superconducting topological invariants of two-dimensional (2D) slab system from first-principles calculations and implemented in an open-source software WannierTools. We hope that it would accelerate the discovery of the topological superconductor candidates.</description>

      <title>Analytical photoresponses of Schottky contact MoS2 phototransistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-gain photodetectors based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, in particular those in photoconductive mode, have been extensively investigated in the past decade. However, the classical photoconductive theory was derived on two misplaced assumptions. In this work, we established an explicit analytical device model for Schottky contact MoS2 phototransistors that fits well with experimental data. From the fitting results, we found that the Richardson constant of the MoS2 Schottky contact is temperature dependent, indicating that the Schottky contacts for the 2D material is best described by the mixed thermionic emission and diffusion model. Based on this device model, we further established an analytical photoresponse for the few-layer MoS2 phototransistors, from which we found the voltage distribution on the two Schottky contacts and the channel, and extracted the minority carrier recombination lifetimes. The lifetimes are comparable with the values found from transient photoluminescence measurements, which therefore validates our analytical photoresponses for Schottky contact 2D semiconducting phototransistors.</description>

      <title>Extended spin relaxation times of optically addressed telecom defects in silicon carbide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically interfaced solid-state defects are promising candidates for quantum communication technologies. The ideal defect system would feature bright telecom emission, long-lived spin states, and a scalable material platform, simultaneously. Here, we employ one such system, vanadium (V4+) in silicon carbide (SiC), to establish a potential telecom spin-photon interface within a mature semiconductor host. This demonstration of efficient optical spin polarization and readout facilitates all optical measurements of temperature-dependent spin relaxation times (T1). With this technique, we lower the temperature from about 2K to 100 mK to observe a remarkable four-orders-of-magnitude increase in spin T1 from all measured sites, with site-specific values ranging from 57 ms to above 27 s. Furthermore, we identify the underlying relaxation mechanisms, which involve a two-phonon Orbach process, indicating the opportunity for strain-tuning to enable qubit operation at higher temperatures. These results position V4+ in SiC as a prime candidate for scalable quantum nodes in future quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy with 1089 foci, enabled by a high repetition rate amplified oscillator and optical parametric amplifier. We employ a camera as multichannel detector to acquire and separate the signals from the foci, rather than using the camera image itself. This allows to retain the insensitivity of the imaging to sample scattering afforded by the non-linear excitation point-spread function, which is the hallmark of point-scanning techniques. We show frame rates of 0.3Hz for a megapixel CARS image, limited by the camera used. The laser source and corresponding CARS signal allows for at least 1000 times higher speed, and using faster cameras would allow acquiring at that speed, opening a perspective to megapixel CARS imaging with more than 100Hz frame rate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Modeling of Crystallization at Mesoscopic Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization processes at the mesoscopic scale, where faceted, dendritic growth, and multigrain formation can be observed, are of particular interest within materials science and metallurgy. These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $\lambda_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics and Hamiltonian remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. We report Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg J, Kitaev K, and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. K and $\Gamma$ exhibit dominant quadratic dependencies on $\lambda_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides foundation for exploring exotic 2D magnetic topologies by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</description>

      <title>Observation of in-plane anomalous Hall effect associated with orbital magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a century, the Hall effect, a transverse effect under out-of-plane magnetic field or magnetization, has been a cornerstone for magnetotransport studies and applications. Modern theoretical formulation based on the Berry curvature has revealed the potential that even in-plane magnetic field can induce anomalous Hall effect, but its experimental demonstration has remained difficult due to its potentially small magnitude and strict symmetry requirements. Here we report observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect by measuring low-carrier density films of magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$. Anomalous Hall resistance exhibits distinct three-fold rotational symmetry for changes in the in-plane field component, and this can be understood in terms of out-of-plane Weyl points splitting or orbital magnetization induced by in-plane field, as also confirmed by model calculation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of in-plane field to control the Hall effect, accelerating materials development and further exploration of various in-plane field induced phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Layered van der Waals transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), generally composed of three atomic X-M-X planes in each layer (M = transition metal, X = chalcogen), provide versatile platforms for exploring diverse quantum phenomena. In each MX2 layer, the M-X bonds are predominantly covalent in nature, as a result, the cleavage of TMDC crystals always occurring between the layers. Here we report the controllable realization of fractional-layer WTe2 via an in-situ scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tip manipulation technique. By applying STM tip pulses, hundreds of the topmost Te atoms are removed to form a nanoscale monolayer Te pit in the 1T'-WTe2, thus realizing a brand-new 2/3-layer WTe2. Such a unique configuration undergoes a spontaneous atomic reconstruction, yielding an energy-dependent unidirectional charge-density-wave state with the wavevector and geometry quite distinct from that of pristine 1T'-WTe2. Our results expand the conventional understanding of the TMDCs and are expected to stimulate the research on extraordinary structures and properties based on fractional-layer TMDCs.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological magnetism in Hund's excitonic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogous to the charged electron-electron pair condensation in superconductors, an excitonic insulator (EI) represents Fermi surface instability due to spontaneous formation and condensation of charge-neutral electron-hole pair (exciton). Unlike in superconductors, however, the charge-neutral nature of exciton makes probing emergent EI phase via macroscopic physical properties generally difficult. Here, we propose a van der Waals coupled antiferromagnetic semiconductor GdGaI (GGI) as a new material category leading to emergent multi-q magnet intertwined with spontaneous exciton formation/condensation. Before excitonic band hybridization, a simple picture for the parent electronic state consists of electron (Gd-derived 5d) and hole (Ga-derived 4p) delocalized bands, together with Gd-derived 4f localized antiferromagnets with S = 7/2 classical nature. Through intra Gd atom 4f-5d Hund's coupling, a notable finding is the emergent minimum length scale (2a) Skyrmion-like spin texture resulting from spontaneous condensation/formation of spin-polarized exciton with BCS-BEC crossover phenomenology. This discovered platform is promising for realizing valuable quantum matter on the nanoscale; our finding will provide significant insight into designing the atomic scale topological magnetism out of itinerant systems.</description>

      <title>All-voltage control of Giant Magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of voltage control of magnetism is to reduce the power consumption of spintronic devices. For a spin valve, the magnetization directions of two ferromagnetic layers determine the giant magnetoresistance magnitude. However, achieving all-voltage manipulation of the magnetization directions between parallel and antiparallel states is a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that by utilizing two exchange-biased Co/IrMn bilayers with opposite pinning directions and with ferromagnetic coupling through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between two Co layers, the magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic layers of a spin valve can be switched between parallel and antiparallel states through allvoltage-induced strain control. The all-voltage controlled giant magnetoresistance is repeatable and nonvolatile. The rotation of magnetizations in the two Co layers under voltages, from antiparallel to parallel states, occurs in opposite directions as revealed through simulations utilizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. This work can provide valuable reference for the development of low-power all-voltage-controlled spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids and their density of states. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Direct view of gate-tunable miniband dispersion in graphene superlattices near the magic twist angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superlattices from twisted graphene mono- and bi-layer systems give rise to on-demand quantum many-body states such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductors and the fractional quantum Hall effect. These phenomena are observed in transport experiments when changing the filling of the low-energy electronic bands. Their origin is broadly ascribed to a combination of flat bands and strong Coulomb interactions, yet a comprehensive understanding is lacking. This is primarily because the relevant low-energy band structure is believed to strongly change in a non-trivial way as the electron filling is varied. Here we gain direct access to the filling-dependent low energy bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) by applying micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to in situ gated devices. Our findings for the two systems are in stark contrast: The doping dependent dispersion for TBG can be described in a simple model, combining a filling-dependent rigid band shift with a many-body related bandwidth change. In TDBG, on the other hand, we find a complex behaviour of the low-energy bands, combining non-monotonous bandwidth changes and tuneable gap openings. Our work establishes the extent of electric field tunability of the low energy electronic states in twisted graphene superlattices and can serve to underpin the theoretical understanding of the resulting phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as an ideal platform for creating engineered artificial electronic states. While vertical heterostructures have been extensively studied, realizing high-quality lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces remains a major experimental challenge. Here, we advance a one-pot two-step molecular beam lateral epitaxy approach and successfully synthesize atomically well-defined 1T-VSe$_2$ -- 1H-NbSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures. We demonstrate the formation of defect-free lateral heterostructures and characterize their electronic structure using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations. We find additional electronic states at the one-dimensional interface as well as signatures of Kondo resonances in a side-coupled geometry. Our experiments explore the full potential of lateral heterostructures for realizing exotic electronic states in low-dimensional systems for further studies of artificial designer quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Third Harmonic Generation in Two-Dimensional Tin Sulfide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-plane anisotropic properties of two-dimensional (2D) group IV monochalcogenides provide an additional degree of freedom which can be used in future optoelectronic devices. Here, it is shown that the third harmonic generation (THG) signal produced by ultrathin tin (II) sulfide (SnS) is in-plane anisotropic with respect to the incident linear polarization of the laser field. We fit the experimental polarization-resolved THG (P-THG) measurements with a nonlinear optics model, which accounts for the orthorhombic crystal structure of 2D SnS. We calculate the relative magnitudes of the \{chi}^(3) tensor components by recording and simultaneously fitting both orthogonal components of the P-THG intensity. Furthermore, we introduce a THG anisotropy ratio, whose calculated values compare the total THG intensity when the excitation linear polarization is along the armchair crystallographic direction with the case when it is along the zigzag direction. Our results provide quantitative information on the anisotropic nature of the THG process in SnS, paving the way to a better understanding of anisotropic nonlinear light-matter interactions, and the development of polarization-sensitive nonlinear optical devices.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the magnetic properties of the hexagonal ferrite PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. Recent experiments have reported puzzling dependencies of the ordering temperature and the saturation magnetization on the Ga concentration $x$. To explain these observations, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on the effects of an unequal distribution of the Ga impurities over the five distinct Fe sublattices. Ab-initio density-functional calculations predict that the Ga ions preferably occupy the $12k$ sublattice and (to a lesser extent) the $2a$ sublattice. We incorporate this insight into a nonuniform model of the Ga distribution. Monte Carlo simulations using this model lead to an excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the ordering temperature and saturation magnetization, indicating that the unequal distribution of the Ga impurities is the main reason for the unusual magnetic properties of PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$. We also compute the temperature and concentration dependencies of the sublattice magnetizations, and we study the character of the zero-temperature transition that takes place when the ordering temperature is tuned to zero.</description>

Abstract: Atomic vacancies, such as chalcogen vacancies in 2D TMDs, are important in changing the host material's electronic structure and transport properties. We present a straightforward one-step method for growing monolayer MoS2 utilizing oxidized Molybdenum (Mo) foil using CVD and delve into the transport properties of as-grown samples. Devices fabricated from these MoS2 sheets exhibit excellent electrical responses, with the standout device achieving mobility exceeding 100 cm2V-1s-1. Structural analysis and optical signatures unveiled the presence of chalcogen defects within these samples. To decipher the influence of inherent defects on the electronic transport properties, we measured low-temperature transport on two distinct sets of devices exhibiting relatively high or low mobilities. Combining the thermally activated transport model with quantum capacitance calculations, we have shown the existence of shallow states near the conduction band, likely attributed to sulfur vacancies within MoS2. These vacancies are responsible for the hopping conduction of electrons in the device channel. Furthermore, our claims were substantiated through low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements, which revealed an abundance of isolated and lateral double sulfur vacancies in Mo foil-grown samples. We found that these vacancies increase the density of states near the conduction band, inducing intrinsic n-type doping in the MoS2 channel. Consequently, this elevated conductivity enhances the field-effect mobility of MoS2 transistors. Our study offers insights into chalcogen vacancies in CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 and highlights their beneficial impact on electronic transport properties.</description>

Abstract: Energy functionals of the Green's function can simultaneously provide spectral and thermodynamic properties of interacting electrons' systems. Though powerful in principle, these formulations need to deal with dynamical (frequency-dependent) quantities, increasing the algorithmic and numerical complexity and limiting applications. We first show that, when representing all frequency-dependent propagators as sums over poles, the typical operations of dynamical formulations become closed (i.e., all quantities are expressed as sums over poles) and analytical. Importantly, we map the Dyson equation into a nonlinear eigenvalue problem that can be solved exactly; this is achieved by introducing a fictitious non-interacting system with additional degrees of freedom which shares, upon projection, the same Green's function of the real system. Last, we introduce an approximation to the exchange-correlation part of the Klein functional adopting a localized $GW$ approach; this is a generalization of the static Hubbard extension of density-functional theory with a dynamical screened potential $U(\omega)$. We showcase the algorithmic efficiency of the methods, and the physical accuracy of the functional, by computing the spectral, thermodynamic, and vibrational properties of SrVO$_3$, finding results in close agreement with experiments and state-of-the-art methods, at highly reduced computational costs and with a transparent physical interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Materials property prediction models are usually evaluated using random splitting of datasets into training and test datasets, which not only leads to over-estimated performance due to inherent redundancy, typically existent in material datasets, but also deviate away from the common practice of materials scientists: they are usually interested in predicting properties for a known subset of related out-of-distribution (OOD) materials rather than a universally distributed samples. Feeding such target material formulas/structures to the machine learning models should improve the prediction performance while most current machine learning (ML) models neglect this information. Here we propose to use domain adaptation (DA) to enhance current ML models for property prediction and evaluate their performance improvements in a set of five realistic application scenarios. Our systematic benchmark studies show that there exist DA models that can significantly improve the OOD test set prediction performance while standard ML models and most of the other DAs cannot improve or even deteriorate the performance. Our benchmark datasets and DA code can be freely accessed at https://github.com/Little-Cheryl/MatDA.</description>

      <title>Realistic non-collinear ground states of solids with source-free exchange correlation functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the source-free (SF) exchange correlation (XC) functional developed by Sangeeta Sharma and co-workers to plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. This constraint is implemented by the current authors within the VASP source code, using a fast Poisson solver that capitalizes on the parallel three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) implemented in VASP. Using this modified XC functional, we explore the improved convergence behavior that results from applying this constraint to the GGA-PBE+$U$+$J$ functional. In the process, we compare the non-collinear magnetic ground state computed by each functional and their SF counterpart for a select number of magnetic materials in order to provide a metric for comparing with experimentally determined magnetic orderings. We observe significantly improved agreement with experimentally measured magnetic ground state structures after applying the source-free constraint. Furthermore, we explore the importance of considering probability current densities in spin polarized systems, even under no applied field. We analyze the XC torque as well, in order to provide theoretical and computational analyses of the net XC magnetic torque induced by the source-free constraint. Along these lines, we highlight the importance of properly considering the real-space integral of the source-free local magnetic XC field. Our analysis on probability currents, net torque, and constant terms draws additional links to the rich body of previous research on spin-current density functional theory (SCDFT), and paves the way for future extensions and corrections to the SF corrected XC functional.</description>

Abstract: The vast high entropy alloy (HEA) composition space is promising for discovery of new material phases with unique properties. We explore the potential to achieve rare-earth-free high magnetic anisotropy materials in single-phase HEA thin films. Thin films of FeCoNiMnCu sputtered on thermally oxidized Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates at room temperature are magnetically soft, with a coercivity on the order of 10 Oe. After post-deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA), the films exhibit a single face-centered-cubic phase, with an almost 40-fold increase in coercivity. Inclusion of 50 at.% Pt in the film leads to ordering of a single L1$_{0}$ high entropy intermetallic phase after RTA, along with high magnetic anisotropy and 3 orders of magnitude coercivity increase. These results demonstrate a promising HEA approach to achieve high magnetic anisotropy materials using RTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solid state systems, group representation theory is powerful in characterizing the behavior of quasiparticles, notably the energy degeneracy. While conventional group theory is effective in answering yes-or-no questions related to symmetry breaking, its application to determining the magnitude of energy splitting resulting from symmetry lowering is limited. Here, we propose a theory on quasi-symmetry and near degeneracy, thereby expanding the applicability of group theory to address questions regarding large-or-small energy splitting. Defined within the degenerate subspace of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, quasi-symmetries form an enlarged symmetry group eliminating the first-order splitting. This framework ensures that the magnitude of splitting arises as a second-order effect of symmetry-lowering perturbations, such as external fields and spin-orbit coupling. We systematically tabulate the quasi-symmetry groups within 32 crystallographic point groups and demonstrate that $Z_{n}$, $U(1)$, and $D_{\infty}$ can serve as the quotient group of unitary quasi-symmetry group in doubly degenerate subspace. Applying our theory to the realistic material AgLa, we predict a "quasi-Dirac semimetal" phase characterized by two tiny-gap band anticrossings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a computational framework (InterMat) to predict band offsets of semiconductor interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and graph neural networks (GNN). As a first step, we benchmark OptB88vdW generalized gradient approximation (GGA) work functions and electron affinities for surfaces against experimental data with accuracies of 0.29 eV and 0.39 eV, respectively. Similarly, we evaluate band offset values using independent unit (IU) and alternate slab junction (ASJ) models leading to accuracies of 0.45 eV and 0.22 eV, respectively. We use bulk band structure calculations with the TBmBJ meta-GGA functional to correct for band gap underestimation when predicting conduction band properties. During ASJ structure generation, we use Zur algorithm along with a unified GNN force-field to tackle the conformation challenges of interface design. At present, we have 607 surface work functions calculated with DFT, from which we can compute 183921 IU band offsets as well as 593 directly calculated ASJ band offsets. Finally, as the space of all possible heterojunctions is too large to simulate with DFT, we develop generalized GNN models to quickly predict bulk band edges with an accuracy of 0.26 eV. We show how these models can be used to predict relevant quantities including ionization potentials, electron affinities, and IU-based band offsets. We establish simple rules using the above models to pre-screen potential semiconductor devices from a vast pool of nearly 1.4 trillion candidate interfaces.

      <title>Correcting force error-induced underestimation of lattice thermal conductivity in machine learning molecular dynamics</title>

Abstract: Machine learned potentials (MLPs) have been widely employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study thermal transport. However, literature results indicate that MLPs generally underestimate the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of typical solids. Here, we quantitatively analyze this underestimation in the context of the neuroevolution potential (NEP), which is a representative MLP that balances efficiency and accuracy. Taking crystalline silicon, GaAs, graphene, and PbTe as examples, we reveal that the fitting errors in the machine-learned forces against the reference ones are responsible for the underestimated LTC as they constitute external perturbations to the interatomic forces. Since the force errors of a NEP model and the random forces in the Langevin thermostat both follow a Gaussian distribution, we propose an approach to correcting the LTC by intentionally introducing different levels of force noises via the Langevin thermostat and then extrapolating to the limit of zero force error. Excellent agreement with experiments is obtained by using this correction for all the prototypical materials over a wide range of temperatures. Based on spectral analyses, we find that the LTC underestimation mainly arises from increased phonon scatterings in the low-frequency region caused by the random force errors.</description>

      <title>A finite geometry, inertia assisted coarsening-to-complexity transition in homogeneous frictional systems</title>

Abstract: The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems, manifested in broad distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable frictional systems of height $H$. The latter are described at the continuum scale within a realistic rate-and-state friction interfacial constitutive framework, where elasto-frictional instabilities emerge from rate-weakening friction. For large $H$, such frictional systems were recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length ratio becomes small, coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter features slip bursts, classified into predominantly non-propagating small bursts and propagating large bursts, which are non-trivially distributed. The statistical distributions emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed. We discuss the robustness of our findings against variations of the frictional parameters, most notably affecting the magnitude of frictional rate-weakening, as well as against different interfacial state evolution laws. Finally, we demonstrate a reverse transition in which statistical complexity disappears in favor of the spatially periodic traveling solution. Overall, our results elucidate how relatively simple physical ingredients can give rise to the emergence of slip complexity.</description>

      <title>Development of a Gaussian Approximation Potential to Study Structure and Thermodynamics of Nickel Nanoclusters</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) potentials such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mapping structure to properties across diverse systems. Here, we introduce a GAP model for low-dimensional Ni nanoclusters and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness in capturing the energetics, structural diversity and thermodynamic properties of Ni nanoclusters across a broad size range. Through a systematic approach encompassing model development, validation, and application, we evaluate the model's efficacy in representing energetics and configurational features in low-dimensional regimes, while also examining its extrapolative nature to vastly different spatiotemporal regimes. Our analysis and discussion shed light on the data quality required to effectively train such models. Trajectories from large scale MD simulations using the GAP model analyzed with data-driven models like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) reveal intriguing insights into the size-dependent phase behavior and thermo-mechanical stability characteristics of porous Ni nanoparticles. Overall, our work underscores the potential of ML models which coupled with data-driven approaches serve as versatile tools for studying low-dimensional systems and complex material dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Physical and chemical properties of materials can be modified by a resonant optical mode. Such recent demonstrations have mostly relied on a planar cavity geometry, others have relied on a plasmonic resonator. However, the combination of these two device architectures have remained largely unexplored, especially in the context of maximizing light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate several schemes of electromagnetic field confinement aimed at facilitating the collective coupling of a localized photonic mode to molecular vibrations in the terahertz region. The key aspects are the use of metasurface plasmonic structures combined with standard Fabry-Perot configurations and the deposition of a thin layer of glucose, via a spray coating technique, within a tightly focused electromagnetic mode volume. More importantly, we demonstrate enhanced vacuum Rabi splittings reaching up to 200 GHz when combining plasmonic resonances, photonic cavity modes and low-energy molecular resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a cavity mode can be utilized to enhance the zero-point electric field amplitude of a plasmonic resonator. Our study provides key insight into the design of polaritonic platforms with organic molecules to harvest the unique properties of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Theory of Difference Frequency Quantum Oscillations</title>

Abstract: Quantum oscillations (QO) describe the periodic variation of physical observables as a function of inverse magnetic field in metals. The Onsager relation connects the basic QO frequencies with the extremal areas of closed Fermi surface pockets, and the theory of magnetic breakdown explains the observation of sums of QO frequencies at high magnetic fields. Here we develop a quantitative theory of difference frequency QOs in two- and three-dimensional metals with multiple Fermi pockets with parabolic or linearly dispersing excitations. We show that a non-linear interband coupling, e.g. in the form of interband impurity scattering, can give rise to otherwise forbidden QO frequencies which can persist to much higher temperatures compared to the basis frequencies. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings for various material candidates, for example multi-fold fermion systems, and the relation to magneto intersubband oscillations known for coupled two-dimensional electron gases.</description>

      <title>Rashba-splitting-induced topological flat band detected by anomalous resistance oscillations beyond the quantum limit in ZrTe$_5$</title>

Abstract: Topological flat band, on which the kinetic energy of topological electrons is quenched, represents a platform for investigating the topological properties of correlated systems. Recent experimental studies on flattened electronic bands have mainly concentrated on 2-dimensional materials created by van der Waals heterostructure-based engineering. Here, we report the observation of a topological flat band formed by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting in a 3-dimensional Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The polar distortion and resulting Rashba splitting on the band are directly detected by torque magnetometry and the anomalous Hall effect, respectively. The local symmetry breaking further flattens the band, on which we observe resistance oscillations beyond the quantum limit. These oscillations follow the temperature dependence of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula but are evenly distributed in B instead of 1/B in high magnetic fields. Furthermore, the cyclotron mass anomalously gets enhanced about 10$^2$ times at field ~20 T. These anomalous properties of oscillations originate from a topological flat band with quenched kinetic energy. The topological flat band, realized by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting in the 3-dimensional Dirac system ZrTe$_5$, signifies an intrinsic platform without invoking moir\'e or order-stacking engineering, and also opens the door for studying topologically correlated phenomena beyond the dimensionality of two.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Neural Networks for Reversible Dissipative Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.</description>
