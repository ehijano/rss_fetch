      <title>Further results on Minimal and Minimum Cylindrical Algebraic Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider cylindrical algebraic decompositions (CADs) as a tool for representing semi-algebraic subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this framework, a CAD $\mathscr{C}$ is adapted to a given set $S$ if $S$ is a union of cells of $\mathscr{C}$. Different algorithms computing an adapted CAD may produce different outputs, usually with redundant cell divisions. In this paper we analyse the possibility to remove the superfluous data. We thus consider the set $\text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$ of CADs of class $C^r$ ($r \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty, \omega\}$) that are adapted to a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of semi-algebraic sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the refinement partial order and we study the existence of minimal and minimum element in $\text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$. We show that for every such $\mathcal{F}$ and every $\mathscr{C} \in \text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$, there is a minimal CAD of class $C^r$ adapted to $\mathcal{F}$ and smaller (i.e. coarser) than or equal to $\mathscr{C}$. In dimension $n=1$ or $n=2$, this result is strengthened by proving the existence of a minimum element in $\text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$. In contrast, for any $n \geq 3$, we provide explicit examples of semi-algebraic sets whose associated poset of adapted CADs does not admit a minimum. We then introduce a reduction relation on $\text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$ in order to define an algorithm for the computation of minimal CADs and we characterise those semi-algebraic sets $\mathcal{F}$ for which $\text{CAD}^r(\mathcal{F})$ has a minimum by means of confluence of the associated reduction system. We finally provide practical criteria for deciding if a semi-algebraic set does admit a minimum CAD and apply them to describe various concrete examples of semi-algebraic sets, along with their minimum CAD of class $C^r$.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description>
