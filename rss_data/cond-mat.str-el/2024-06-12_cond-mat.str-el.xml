      <title>Composite helical edges from Abelian fractional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge state made of a regular helical liquid carrying charge $e$ and a (fractionalized) helical liquid carrying charge $e/n$. A systematic framework is developed for these composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge states with $n=1,2,3$. For $n=2$, the composite edge state consists of a regular helical Luttinger liquid and a fractional topological insulator (the Abelian $Z_4$ topological order) edge state arising from half-filled conjugated Chern bands. The composite edge state with $n=2$ is pertinent to the recent twisted MoTe$_2$ experiment, suggesting a possible fractional topological insulator with conductance $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ per edge. Using bosonization, we construct generic phase diagrams in the presence of $weak$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In addition to a phase of free bosons, we find a time-reversal symmetry-breaking localized insulator, two perfect positive drag phases, a perfect negative drag phase (for $n=2,3$), a time-reversal symmetric Anderson localization (only for $n=1$), and a disorder-dominated metallic phase analogous to the $\nu=2/3$ disordered fractional quantum Hall edges (only for $n=3$). We further compute the two-terminal edge-state conductance, the primary experimental characterization for the (fractional) topological insulator. Remarkably, the negative drag phase gives rise to an unusual edge-state conductance, $(1-1/n)\frac{e^2}{h}$, not directly associated with the filling factor. We further investigate the effect of an applied in-plane magnetic field. For $n&gt;1$, the applied magnetic field can result in a phase with edge-state conductance $\frac{1}{n}\frac{e^2}{h}$, providing another testable signature. Our work establishes a systematic understanding of the composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a d-2-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as U(1) gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Single Particle Spectrum of Doped $\mathrm{C}_{20}\mathrm{H}_{12}$-Perylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo study of doped perylene $\mathrm{C}_{20}\mathrm{H}_{12}$ described with the Hubbard model. Doped perylene can be used for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or as acceptor material in organic solar cells. Therefore, central to this study is a scan over charge chemical potential. A variational basis of operators allows for the extraction of the single-particle spectrum through a mostly automatic fitting procedure. Finite chemical potential simulations suffer from a sign problem which we ameliorate through contour deformation. The on-site interaction is kept at $U/\kappa = 2$. Discretization effects are handled through a continuum limit extrapolation. Our first-principles calculation shows significant deviation from non-interacting results especially at large chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experiments. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features are present a priori, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum. We show examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of "model selection," can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <title>Quantum weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a fundamental property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the ground-state static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelength. We show that quantum weight of three-dimensional electron systems is related by a sum rule to the inverse dielectric function, which describes electron energy loss spectrum. Using this relation, we derive an upper and a lower bound on the quantum weight of real materials in terms of their electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. For systems with short-range interactions or Coulomb systems in reduced dimensions, we derive a sum rule relating the quantum weight to the optical conductivity and establish a remarkable connection with the quantum geometry of many-body ground states. Our work highlights quantum weight as a key material parameter that can be experimentally determined.</description>

      <title>Frustrated phonon with charge density wave in vanadium Kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystals with unique ionic arrangements and strong electronic correlations serve as a fertile ground for the emergence of exotic phases, as evidenced by the coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity in vanadium Kagome metals, specifically AV3Sb5 (where A represents K, Rb, or Cs). The formation of a star of David CDW superstructure, resulting from the coordinated displacements of vanadium ions on a corner sharing triangular lattice, has garnered significant attention in efforts to comprehend the influence of electron phonon interaction within this geometrically intricate lattice. However, understanding of the underlying mechanism behind CDW formation, coupled with symmetry protected lattice vibrations, remains elusive. In this study, we employed time resolved X ray scattering experiments utilising an X ray free electron laser. Our findings reveal that the phonon mode associated with the out of plane motion of Cs ions becomes frustrated in the CDW phase. Furthermore, we observed the photoinduced emergence of a metastable CDW phase, facilitated by the alleviation of frustration through nonadiabatic changes in free energy. By elucidating the longstanding puzzle surrounding the intervention of phonons in CDW ordering, this research offers fresh insights into the competition between phonons and periodic lattice distortions, a phenomenon widespread in other correlated quantum materials including layered high Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>The renormalized classical spin liquid on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental detection of the onset of a dynamically prepared, gapped $Z_2$ quantum spin liquid on the ruby lattice brought the physics of frustrated magnetism and lattice gauge theory to Rydberg tweezer arrays (Semeghini et al, Science 374, 1242 (2021)). The thermodynamic properties of such models remain inadequately addressed, yet knowledge thereof is indispensable if one wants to prepare large, robust, and long-lived quantum spin liquids. Using large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations we find in the PXP model a renormalized classical spin liquid with constant entropy density $S/N$ approaching $\ln(2)/6$ in the thermodynamic limit for all moderate and large values of the detuning $\delta$ and starting from $T/\Omega \sim 0.5$ (in units of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$) down to the lowest temperatures we could simulate, $T/\Omega \sim 0.01$. With Van der Waals interactions, constant entropy plateaus are still found but its value shifts with $\delta$. We comment the adiabatic approximation to the dynamical ramps for the electric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Insulator-to-Metal Transition and Anomalously Slow Hot Carrier Cooling in a Photo-doped Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-doped Mott insulators can exhibit novel photocarrier transport and relaxation dynamics and non-equilibrium phases. However, time-resolved real-space imaging of these processes are still lacking. Here, we use scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to directly visualize the spatial-temporal evolution of photoexcited species in a spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator {\alpha}-RuCl3. At low optical fluences, we observe extremely long hot photocarrier transport time over one nanosecond, almost an order of magnitude longer than any known values in conventional semiconductors. At higher optical fluences, we observe nonlinear features suggesting a photo-induced insulator-to-metal transition, which is unusual in a large-gap Mott insulator. Our results demonstrate the rich physics in a photo-doped Mott insulator that can be extracted from spatial-temporal imaging and showcase the capability of SUEM to sensitively probe photoexcitations in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling induced orbital entanglement in a three-band Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the ground state properties of the square-lattice three-band Hubbard model with a single electron per site is studied by a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation. We calculate the full phase diagram and show that there appear additional orbital-entangled phases brought about by competition of various exchange channels or by the spin-orbit coupling in addition to conventional states stabilized by the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism. One of these phases previously proposed to explain magnetic properties of Sr$_2$VO$_4$ is characterized by vanishing dipolar magnetic moments and antiferro-octupolar ordering. We calculated microscopic parameters for this material and demonstrate that it is located near a phase boundary of two orbital-entangled and two conventional antiferromagnetic ferro-orbital states.</description>

      <title>Average-exact mixed anomalies and compatible phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter spectrum of Chern bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in an external magnetic field. We first focus on a paradigmatic model of WSe$_2$, which can be described in an adiabatic approximation as particles moving in a periodic potential and an emergent periodic magnetic field with nonzero average. We understand the magnetic-field dependent spectra of WSe$_2$ based on the point net zero flux, at which the external field cancels the average emergent field. At this point, the band structure interpolates between the tightly-bound and nearly-free (weak periodic potential) paradigms as the twist angle increases. For small twist angles, the energy levels in a magnetic field mirror the Hofstadter butterfly of the Haldane model. For larger twist angles, the isolated Chern band at zero flux evolves from nearly-free bands at the point of net zero flux. We also apply our framework to a realistic model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, which has recently been suggested to feature higher Landau level analogs. We show that at negative unit flux per unit cell, the bands exhibit remarkable similarity to a backfolded parabolic dispersion, even though the adiabatic approximation is inapplicable. This backfolded parabolic dispersion naturally explains the similarity of the Chern bands at zero applied flux to the two lowest Landau levels, offering a simple picture supporting the emergence of non-Abelian states in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. We propose the study of magnetic field dependent band structures as a versatile method to investigate the nature of topological bands and identify Landau level analogs.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Local aging effects in PuB$_{4}$: Growing inhomogeneity and slow dynamics of local-field fluctuations probed by $^{239}$Pu NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of self-irradiation damage can influence many properties of a radioactive material. Actinide materials involving the decay through alpha radiation have been frequently studied using techniques such as transport, thermodynamics, and x-ray diffraction. The use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study such effects, however, has seen relatively little attention. Here, we use $^{239}$Pu NMR to study the local influence of self-damage in a single crystal of the candidate topological insulator plutonium tetraboride (PuB$_{4}$). We first characterize the anisotropy of the $^{239}$Pu resonance in a single crystal and confirm the local axial site symmetry inferred from previous polycrystalline measurements. Aging effects are then evaluated over the timeframe of six years. We find that, though the static NMR spectra may show a slight modulation in their shape, their field-rotation pattern reveals no change in Pu local site symmetry over time, suggesting that aging has a surprisingly small impact on the spatial distribution of the static hyperfine field. By contrast, aging has a prominent impact on the NMR relaxation processes and signal intensity. Specifically, aging-induced damage manifests itself as an increase in the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_{1}$, an increased distribution of $T_{1}$, and a signal intensity that decreases linearly by 20 % per year. The spin-spin relaxation time $T_{2}$ in the aged sample shows a strong variation across the spectrum as well as a drastic shortening towards lower temperature, suggesting growth of slow fluctuations of the hyperfine field that are linked to radiation-damage-induced inhomogeneity and could be responsible for the signal wipeout that develops over time.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Hedin's equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>

Abstract: Fractons are exotic quasiparticles whose mobility in space is restricted by symmetries. In potential real-world realisations, fractons are likely lodged to a physical material rather than absolute space. Motivated by this, we propose and explore a new symmetry principle that restricts the motion of fractons relative to a physical solid. Unlike models with restricted mobility in absolute space, these fractonic solids admit gauge-invariant momentum density, are compatible with boost symmetry, and can consistently be coupled to gravity. We also propose a holographic model for fractonic solids.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of a holographic dimension in a system of 2D non-interacting Dirac fermions placed on a torus, by studying the scaling of multipartite entanglement measures under a sequence of renormalisation group (RG) transformations applied in momentum space. Geometric measures defined in this emergent space can be related to the RG beta function of the spectral gap, hence establishing a holographic connection between the spatial geometry of the emergent spatial dimension and the entanglement properties of the boundary quantum theory. We prove, analytically, that changing the boundedness of the holographic space involves a topological transition accompanied by a critical Fermi surface in the boundary theory. We go on to show that this results in the formation of a quantum wormhole geometry that connects the UV and the IR of the emergent dimension. The additional conformal symmetry at the transition also supports a relation between the emergent metric and the stress-energy tensor. In the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux, the entanglement gains a geometry-independent piece which is shown to be topological, sensitive to changes in boundary conditions, and related to the Luttinger volume of the system. Upon the insertion of a strong transverse magnetic field, we show that the Luttinger volume is linked to the Chern number of the occupied single-particle Landau levels.</description>

Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>Cubic* criticality emerging from a quantum loop model on triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems with local constraints. Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\'e materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Multiband Metallic Ground State in Multilayered Nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Probed by $^{139}$La-NMR at Ambient Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a $^{139}$La-NMR study of polycrystalline samples of multi($n$)-layered nickelates, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($n=2$) and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ ($n=3$), at ambient pressure. Measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and nuclear spin relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) indicate the emergence of a density wave order with a gap below $T^*\sim150$ K for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and $\sim130$ K for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$. The finite value of $1/T_1$ below $T^*$ indicates metallic ground states with the remaining density of states at the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$) under the density wave order. These features are attributed to multiple $d$ electron bands with different characteristics. Above $T^*$, the gradual decrease in $1/T_1T$ upon cooling implies the presence of a band with flat dispersion near $E_{\rm F}$. From our microscopic probes, we point out that these nickelates ($n=2$ and $3$) possess similar electronic states despite the difference in the formal valence of the Ni-$d$ electron states, which provides a basis for understanding the novel high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity under high pressures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A phase of matter in which fermion quartets form a superconducting condensate, rather than the paradigmatic Cooper pairs, is a recurrent subject of experimental and theoretical studies. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of charge-4$e$ superconductivity as a quantum phase is lacking. Here, we propose and study a two-orbital tight-binding model with attractive Hubbard-type interactions. Such a model naturally provides the Bose-Einstein condensate as a limit for electron quartets and supports charge-4$e$ superconductivity, as we show by mapping it to a spin-1/2 chain in this perturbative limit. Using both exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations for the one-dimensional case, we further establish that the ground state is indeed a superfluid phase of 4$e$ charge carriers and that this phase can be stabilized well beyond the perturbative regime. Importantly, we demonstrate that 4$e$ condensation dominates over 2$e$ condensation even for nearly decoupled orbitals, a scenario suitable for experiments with ultracold atoms in the form of almost decoupled chains. Our model paves the way for both experimental and theoretical exploration of 4$e$ superconductivity and provides a natural starting point for future studies beyond one dimension or more intricate 4$e$ states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that under pressure trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (LNO) becomes superconducting below a critical temperature $\sim$20 K, in addition to the infinite-layer and bilayer systems. Motivated by this observation, we explore the effects of electron correlations on its electronic structure and magnetic properties using the advanced DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our results for the normal-state electronic structure and correlation effects in LNO have much in common with the infinite-layer and bilayer nickelates, with a remarkable site- and orbital-dependent renormalizations of the Ni $3d$ bands and notable incoherence of the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states, caused by correlation effects. Our analysis of the Fermi surface and magnetic correlations suggests the emergence of competing spin and charge stripe states, implying the importance of in-plane spin fluctuations to explain superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Disorder Operator and Entanglement Entropy at Easy-Plane Deconfined Quantum Criticalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the scaling behavior of the disorder operator and the entanglement entropy (EE) of the easy-plane JQ (EPJQ) model at its transitions between the antiferromagnetic XY ordered phase (AFXY) and the valence bond solid (VBS) phase. We find $\mathbf{(1)}$ there exists a tiny yet finite value of the order parameters at the AFXY-VBS phase transition points of the EPJQ model, and the finite order parameter is strengthened as anisotropy $\Delta$ varies from the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$) to the easy-plane limit ($\Delta=0$); $\mathbf{(2)}$ Both EE and disorder operator with smooth boundary cut exhibit anomalous scaling behavior at the transition points, resembling the scaling inside the Goldstone model phase, and the anomalous scaling becomes strengthened as the transition becomes more first order; $\mathbf{(3)}$ First put forward in Ref. [arXiv:2401.12838], with the finite-size corrections in EE for Goldstone phase is properly considered in the fitting form, the anomalous scaling behavior of EE can be adapted with emergent SO(5) symmetry breaking at the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$). We extend this method in the EPJQ model and observe similar yet weaker results, which may indicate emergent SO(4) symmetry breaking in the easy-plane regime ($\Delta&lt;1$) or emergent SO(5) symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$). These observations provide evidence that the N\'eel-VBS transition in the JQ model setting evolves from weak to prominent first-order transition as the system becomes anisotropic, and the non-local probes such as EE and disorder operator, serve as the sensitive tool to detect such salient yet fundamental features.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$: A Composite Fermion Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCIs) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ has sparked significant interest in fractional topological matter without external magnetic fields. Unlike the flat dispersion of Landau levels, moir\'e electronic states are influenced by lattice effects within a nanometer-scale superlattice. This study examines the impact of these lattice effects on the topological phases in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, uncovering a family of FCIs with Abelian anyonic quasiparticles. Using a composite fermion approach, we identify a sequence of FCIs with fractional Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = \frac{C}{2C + 1} \frac{e^2}{h}$ linked to partial filling $\nu_{\,\text{h}}$ of holes of the topmost moir\'e valence band. These states emerge from incompressible composite fermion bands of Chern number $C$ within a complex Hofstadter spectrum. This approach explains FCIs with Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = (2/3) e^2/h$ and $\sigma_{xy} = (3/5) e^2/h$ at fractional fillings $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 2/3$ and $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 3/5$ observed in experiments, and uncovers other fractal FCI states. The Hofstadter spectrum reveals new phenomena, distinct from Landau levels, including a higher-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) at half-filling, leading to novel quantum phase transitions. This work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding FCIs in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e systems and highlights mechanisms for topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In strongly correlated systems the complete determination of the dynamical susceptibility $\chi(\textbf{q}, \omega)$ is of special relevance because of the entwinement of the spin and charge components. Although Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra are directly related to both the charge ($\chi''_c(\textbf{q}, \omega)$) and the spin ($\chi''_s(\textbf{q}, \omega)$) contributions, only the latter has been extensively studied with RIXS so far. Here we show how to extract from RIXS spectra of high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates relevant properties of $\chi''_c$, such as the presence of the superconducting gap and of the pseudogap. In particular, we exploit the temperature dependence of the Cu L$_3$ edge RIXS spectra of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ at specific wave-vectors q. The signature of the two gaps is in the departure of the low energy Bosonic excitation continuum from the statistical temperature-dependence. This approach can be immediately used to investigate systematically the nature of the pseudogap in cuprates, thereby taking advantage of the RIXS technique that does not suffer the limitations of surface-sensitive electron spectroscopies. Its extension to other interesting materials is foreseen.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent limitations. In this work, we introduce the \textit{hyperfine structure of entanglement}, which dissects entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holographic duality, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality and extending bulk reconstruction; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the earlier published theory (\textit{Nature Mat}. \textbf{18}, 223--228 (2019)), a comprehensive experimental investigation of multiferroic quantum critical behavior of (Eu,Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ polycrystalline and single crystal samples was performed. Presence of the displacive ferroelectric quantum criticality is revealed through non-classical ($T^2$) temperature scaling of inverse dielectric susceptibility up to 60\,K. With increasing hydrostatic pressure, this ferroelectric quantum criticality is gradually suppressed. Inverse magnetic susceptibility follows classical Curie-Weiss law down to 4 K, but quantum fluctuations belonging to an antiferromagnetic phase transition ($T_{\mathrm{N}} &lt; 0.8$ K) change its scaling below 3 K to $T^{(1.7\pm 0.1)}$ and $T^{(2.1\pm 0.2)}$ for samples containing 29\,\% and 25\,\% of Eu$^{2+}$ ions, respectively. Experimental indications of the coexisting ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic, i.e. multiferroic, quantum fluctuations and qualitative explanation why they could be seen only in the immediate proximity of $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ is given.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned from global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench are influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted through the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points, thereby precisely delineating phase boundaries. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing single-site observables.</description>

Abstract: The concept of fluidic viscosity is ubiquitous in our everyday life and for it to arise the fluidic medium must necessarily form a continuum where macroscopic properties can emerge. While a powerful concept for tangible liquids, hydrodynamic manifestation of collective flow in electronic systems such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) has only been shown recently to occur in graphene and GaAs/AlGaAs. Here, we present nonlocal electronic transport measurements in concentric annular rings formed in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs and the resulting data strongly suggest that viscous hydrodynamic flow can occur far away from the source-drain current region. Our conclusion of viscous electronic transport is further corroborated by simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations that are found to be in agreement with our measurements below 1K temperature. Most importantly, our work emphasizes the key role played by viscosity via electron-electron (e-e) interaction when hydrodynamic transport is restricted radially, and for which a priori should not have played a major role.</description>
