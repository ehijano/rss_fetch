      <title>Geometric integrators for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>Pure gapped ground states of spin chains are short-range entangled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spin chains with a finite range Hamiltonian. For reasons of simplicity, the chain is taken to be infinitely long. A ground state is said to be a unique gapped ground state if its GNS Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. By combining some powerful techniques developed in the last years, we prove that each unique gapped ground state is short-range entangled: It can be mapped into a product state by a finite time evolution map generated by a Hamiltonian with exponentially quasi-local interaction terms. This claim makes precise the common belief that one-dimensional gapped systems are topologically trivial in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Poisson integrators are Poisson integrators that admit a modified Hamiltonian. In this article, we illustrate the importance of the existence of a modified Hamiltonian for Poisson integrators in the context of integrable and non-integrable systems. Examples of Hamiltonian systems are provided by Lotka-Volterra dynamics; in order to investigate stability properties of Hamiltonian Poisson integrators on non-integrable systems, we exhibit a non-integrable $5$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and pursue numerical investigations of it.</description>

      <title>Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>CLT for the trace functional of the IDS of magnetic random Schr\"{o}dinger operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for a trace functional. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>Logical Operators and Derived Automorphisms of Tile Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced tile codes are a promising alternative to surface codes, combining two-dimensional locality with higher encoding efficiency. While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>On the Modified Eguchi-Oki-Matsumura System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To describe the simultaneous order-disorder transformation and phase separation Eguchi, Oki and Matsumura [\doi{10.1557/proc-21-589}] introduced the system of two equations: one equation, governing the evolution of a conserved order parameter, and the second equation for the non-conserved order parameter. The key feature of their model is the free energy functional, which contains the square gradient terms of the both order parameters and a fourth power polynomial depending on both order parameters. According to the general Hohenberg-Halperin classification it is the type C model. We show that if the dynamics of the conserved order parameter is governed by the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, this system allows exact traveling wave solution.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weizs\"acker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Long-term behavior of the master equation on a countable network and approximation methods of the (stationary) solutions via finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Master equation on directed networks - also called the differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation - is a linear differential equation, which describes the probability evolution in a discrete system. While this is well understood, if the underlying graph is finite, the mathematics required for the treatment of a network with countable many nodes is way more complicated and advanced. In this paper we provide criteria for the rates of the system, which makes it possible to approximate the solution by finite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit. By writing the phase space as a direct sum of stationary states and states which vanish in the time limit, we give a new proof of when the time limit for an countable, infinite dimensional system exists and when it can be interchanged with the limit of large systems. We give sufficient criteria, when these two limits commute and demonstrate on various examples, what happens when these criteria are violated and only one of these limits exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Using reflection positivity, we prove that the ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and that the monopoles are massive. In the presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped, four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered. By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations, show that their self-braiding is proportional to the Hall conductance and hence vanishes, and prove that their braiding with the fermionic excitations is that of the toric code.</description>

Abstract: The open XXZ spin chain with the anisotropy parameter $\Delta=-\frac12$, diagonal boundary fields that depend on a parameter $x$, and finite length $N$ is studied. In a natural normalisation, the components of its ground-state vector are polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients. It is shown that their sum is given by a generating function for the weighted enumeration of totally-symmetric alternating sign matrices with weights depending on $x$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in \cite{aly2024nonlinearities} on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant gauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses global gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry breaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained Hamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their local counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical in the presence of boundary conditions. The symmetry that is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism is this global one. Second, we explain how the Coulomb gauge is the preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs mechanism. Based on the existence of the physical global gauge symmetry, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by arguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate only the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which are not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show that the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess exact structures that resemble integrability, with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such structures live in the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and are based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes, have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite-dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle S^1 to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD, they are color singlets and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to computing the non-interacting kinetic energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-interacting kinetic energy functional, $T_{KS}(\rho)$, plays a fundamental role in Density Functional Theory (DFT), but its explicit form remains unknown for arbitrary $N$-representable densities. Although it can, in principle, be evaluated by solving a constrained optimization problem, the associated adjoint problem is not always well-posed; moreover, even when it is, the corresponding adjoint operator may be singular. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches in the literature precisely determines the non-interacting kinetic energy functional for a given $N$-representable electron density, $\rho$. In this work, we present a variational framework for computing an extension of $T_{KS}(\rho)$ using an exact trigonometric reparametrization of the density that eliminates the need for an adjoint equation. We present a proof-of-concept numerical validation of the variational principle for the special case of one-dimensional Kohn-Sham systems. Our method, however, is general and provides a systematic foundation for computing $T_{KS}(\rho)$ in higher dimensions too, paving the way for improved kinetic energy functionals in DFT.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole Solutions in massive $F(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole geometries in the framework of $F(T)$ gravity supplemented by a weak de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive term. Using the static and spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne metric, we derive the field and conservation equations, separating the effective energy-momentum tensor into torsional and massive contributions. We analyze three representative classes of metric redshift functions, namely constant, logarithmic, and power-law forms, and two cases of the massive term, i.e. the general one and the uniform pressure case. The obtained solutions satisfy the flaring-out condition and remain asymptotically flat, while the effective matter sector can fulfill or only mildly violate the standard energy conditions. The results show that the inclusion of a small graviton mass provides an additional anisotropic pressure that can sustain the throat geometry without introducing exotic sources. In the limit of vanishing graviton mass, the configurations continuously reduce to the standard $F(T)$ wormhole solutions, confirming the consistency of the framework.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum state with finite entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following task: how for a given quantum state $\rho$ to find a grounded Hamiltonian $H$ satisfying the condition $\mathrm{Tr} H\rho\leq E_0&lt;+\infty$ in such a way that the von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state $\gamma_H(E)$ corresponding to a given energy $E&gt;0$ be as small as possible. We show that for any mixed state $\rho$ with finite entropy and any $E&gt;0$ there exists a solution $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ of the above problem (unique in the non-degenerate case) which we call optimal Hamiltonian for the state $\rho$. Explicit expressions for $H(\rho,E_0,E)$, $\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E)$ and $S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are obtained. Analytical properties of the function $E\mapsto S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are explored. Several examples are considered. A basic application of the above task is briefly described (with the intention to give a detailed description in a separate article). As an example, a new semicontinuity bound for the entanglement of formation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of initial boundary value problems for 2D compressible MHD equations in domains with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness is studied for the initial boundary value problem of the two-dimensional compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in bounded perfectly conducting domains with corners. The presence of corners yields intrinsic analytic obstacles: the lack of smooth tangential vectors to the boundary prevents the use of classical anisotropic Sobolev spaces, and due to the coupling of normal derivatives near corners, one can not follow the usual way to estimate the normal derivatives of solutions from the equations. To overcome these difficulties, a new class of anisotropic Sobolev spaces $H^m_*(\Omega)$ is introduced to treat corner geometries. Within this framework, the well-posedness theory is obtained for both linear and nonlinear problems of the compressible ideal MHD equations with the impermeable and perfectly conducting boundary conditions. The associated linearized problem is studied in several steps: first one deduces the existence of weak solutions by using a duality argument in high order tangential spaces, then verifies that it is indeed a strong solution by several smoothing procedures preserving traces to get a weak-strong uniqueness result, afterwards the estimates of normal derivatives are obtained by combining the structure of MHD equations with the Helmholtz-type decomposition for both of velocity and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Topological Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Revisiting the methods of winding numbers calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $\phi$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.</description>
