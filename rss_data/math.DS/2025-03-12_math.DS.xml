      <title>Cubic Polynomial Maps with Periodic Critical Orbit, Part III: Tessellations and Orbit Portraits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameter space ${\mathcal S}_p$ for cubic polynomial maps with a marked critical point of period $p$. We will outline a fairly complete theory as to how the dynamics of the map $F$ changes as we move around the parameter space ${\mathcal S}_p$. For every escape region ${\mathcal E}\subset {\mathcal S}_p$, every parameter ray in ${\mathcal E}$ with rational parameter angle lands at some uniquely defined point in the boundary $\partial{\mathcal E}$. This landing point is necessarily either a parabolic map or a Misiurewicz map. The relationship between parameter rays and dynamic rays is formalized by the period $q$ tessellation of ${\mathcal S}_p$, where maps in the same face of this tessellation always have the same period $q$ orbit portrait.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic and Heteroclinic Trajectories of Differential Equations with Piecewise Constant Arguments of Generalized Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasilinear systems with piecewise constant arguments of generalized type are under investigation from the asymptotic point of view. The systems have discontinuous right-hand sides which are identified via a discrete-time map. It is rigorously proved that homoclinic and heteroclinic solutions are generated, and they are taken into account in the functional sense. The Banach fixed point theorem is used for the verification. The hyperbolic set of solutions is also discussed, and an example supporting the theoretical findings is provided.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that cw-hyperbolic homeomorphisms with jointly continuous stable/unstable holonomies satisfy the periodic shadowing property and, if they are topologically mixing, the periodic specification property. We discuss difficulties to adapt Bowen's techniques to obtain a measure of maximal entropy for cw-hyperbolic homeomorphisms, exhibit the unique measure of maximal entropy for Walter's pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{S}^2$, and prove it can be obtained, as in the expansive case, as the weak* limit of an average of Dirac measures on periodic orbits. As an application, we exhibit the unique measure of maximal entropy for the homeomorphism on the Sierpi\'nski Carpet defined in [12], which does not satisfy the specification property.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation of limit cycles from a cubic reversible isochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the limit cycle problem of a cubic reversible system with an isochronous center, when it is perturbed inside a class of polynomials. An upper bound of the number of limit cycles is obtained using the Abelian integral. The algebraic structure of the Abelian integral is acquired thanks to some iterative formulas, which differs in many aspects from other methods. Some numerical simulations verify the existence of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Limit cycles appearing from the perturbation of a cubic isochronous center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polynomial differential system $$\dot{x}=-y+\sum\limits_{i+j=3}\alpha_{i,j}x^iy^j,\quad \dot{y}=x+\sum\limits_{i+j=3}\beta_{i,j}x^iy^j,$$
  Pleshkan (Differ. Equations, 1969) proved that the origin is an isochronous center of this system iff it can be brought to one of $S^*_1$, $S^*_2$, $S^*_3$ or $S^*_4$. The bifurcation of limit cycles for these four types of isochronous differential systems have not yet been studied, except for $S^*_1$. This paper is devoted to study the limit cycle problem of $S^*_2$ when we perturb it with an arbitrary polynomial vector field. An upper bound of the number of limit cycles is obtained using the Abelian integral.</description>

      <title>Instability of equilibrium and convergence to periodic orbits in strongly 2-cooperative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-invariant nonlinear $n$-dimensional strongly $2$-cooperative systems, that is, systems that map the set of vectors with up to weak sign variation to its interior. Strongly $2$-cooperative systems enjoy a strong Poincare-Bendixson property: bounded solutions that maintain a positive distance from the set of equilibria converge to a periodic solution. For strongly $2$-cooperative systems whose trajectories evolve in a bounded and invariant set that contains a single unstable equilibrium, we provide a simple criterion for the existence of periodic trajectories. Moreover, we explicitly characterize a positive-measure set of initial conditions which yield solutions that asymptotically converge to a periodic trajectory. We demonstrate our theoretical results using two models from systems biology, the $n$-dimensional Goodwin oscillator and a $4$-dimensional biomolecular oscillator with RNA-mediated regulation, and provide numerical simulations that verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider linear non-autonomous systems of Wazewski type on Hilbert spaces and provide a new approach to study their stability properties by means of a decomposition into subsystems and conditions implied on the interconnection properties. These conditions are of the small-gain type but the appoach is based on a conceptually new notion which we call integral gain. This notion is introduced for the first time in this paper. We compare our approach with known results from the literature and demonstrate advantages of our results.</description>

      <title>The dimension of harmonic currents on foliated complex surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a singular holomorphic foliation on an algebraic complex surface $S$, with hyperbolic singularities and no foliated cycle. We prove a formula for the transverse Hausdorff dimension of the unique  harmonic current, involving the Furstenberg entropy and the Lyapunov exponent. In particular, we extend Brunella's inequality to every holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb P^2$: if $\mathcal{F}$ has degree $d \geq 2$, then the Hausdorff dimension of its harmonic current is smaller than or equal to ${d-1 \over d+2}$, in particular the harmonic current is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the harmonic current of the Jouanolou foliation of degree $2$ is equal to $1/4$, and that the same property holds for topologically conjugate foliations on $\mathbb P^2$.</description>

      <title>Tate's question, Standard conjecture D, semisimplicity and Dynamical degree comparison conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ over the algebraic closure of a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$.
  Assuming the standard conjecture $D$, we prove
  a weaker form of the Dynamical Degree Comparison conjecture;
  equivalence of semisimplicity of Frobenius endomorphism and of any polarized endomorphism (a more general result, in terms of the biggest size of Jordan blocks, holds).
  We illustrate these results through examples, including varieties dominated by rational maps from Abelian varieties and suitable products of $K3$ surfaces.
  Using the same idea, we provide a new proof of the main result in a recent paper by the third author, including Tate's question/Serre's conjecture that for a polarized endomorphism $f:X\rightarrow X$, all eigenvalues of the action of $f$ on $H^k(X)$ have the same absolute value.</description>

      <title>Study on Dynamical Behavior of Coinfection Infectious Disease Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper conducts research on the established model and presents the main conclusions . Firstly, by separately considering the infectivity of each of the two infectious diseases and the infectivity of the population simultaneously infected with the two infectious diseases, the existence of three types of boundary equilibrium points is determined, as well as the existence of the interior equilibrium point when the parameters are under specific conditions. Then, the stability of the equilibrium points is analyzed. It is concluded that under different parameter conditions, the stability of the disease free equilibrium point can exhibit various scenarios, such as a stable node or a saddle-node, etc. For the boundary equilibrium points, the situation is more intricate,and a cusp may occur. The stability of the interior equilibrium point under specific conditions is also presented. Finally,the degeneracy of the equilibrium points is studied through the bifurcation theory.Mainly, the saddle-node bifurcation occurring at the interior equilibrium point is obtained, and when the infection rate of the first infectious disease, the infection rate of the second infectious disease, and the infection rate of the co-infected population to other populations are selected as bifurcation parameters, a codimension 3 B-T bifurcation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Invariant subalgebras of the reduced group $C^*$-algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group. We say that $\Gamma$ has $C^*$-invariant subalgebra rigidity (ISR) property if every $\Gamma$-invariant $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{A}\le C_r^*(\Gamma)$ is of the form $C_r^*(N)$ for some normal subgroup $N\triangleleft\Gamma$. We show that all torsion-free, non-amenable (cylindrically) hyperbolic groups with property-AP and a finite direct product of such groups have this property. We also prove that an infinite group $\Gamma$ has the C$^*$-ISR property only if $\Gamma$ is simple amenable or $C^*$-simple.</description>

      <title>Approximations on certain domains of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11107v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are invariant under the positive flows of some globally defined, complete holomorphic vector field
  with a globally attracting fixed point at the origin. Our first result says that such a domain $\Omega$ is always Runge. Next, with an additional assumption on the rate of convergence of the flow, we show that
  any biholomorphism $\Phi\colon \Omega \to \Phi(\Omega)$, with $\Phi(\Omega)$ is Runge, can be approximated by automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ uniformly on compacts. This generalizes all earlier known theorems in this direction substantially, even when the vector field is linear. As an application of our approximation results, on such domains that are also complete hyperbolic, we show that any Loewner PDE in a complete hyperbolic domain $\Omega$ admits an essentially unique univalent solution with values in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We also provide an approximation result for volume preserving biholomorphisms on above domains.
  We provide several examples of such domains.</description>

      <title>State-space systems as dynamic generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Hessian transformation of elliptic curves, both as an action on $j$-invariants and on the Hesse pencil, is a Latt\`es map, namely it ascends to a degree-3 endomorphism $\psi$ of a prescribed elliptic curve $E$. This result provides a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of the Hessian transformation, which inherits its symmetries from $\psi$. In particular, we show that, over arbitrary fields of characteristic different from 2 and 3, the Hessian functional graphs can be completely determined in terms of the action of $\psi$ on the twists of $E$. When the underlying field is finite, we specialize our results to provide a complete classification of Hessian functional graphs. In such a case, we also present a practical way to compute iterated Hessians.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Analysis from Noisy Measurements based on Bayesian Learning and Kalman Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopman spectral analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems as it reveals key system behaviors and long-term dynamics. However, the presence of measurement noise poses a significant challenge to accurately extracting spectral properties. In this work, we propose a robust method for identifying the Koopman operator and extracting its spectral characteristics in noisy environments. To address the impact of noise, our approach tackles an identification problem that accounts for both systematic errors from finite-dimensional approximations and measurement noise in the data. By incorporating Bayesian learning and Kalman smoothing, the method simultaneously identifies the Koopman operator and estimates system states, effectively decoupling these two error sources. The method's efficiency and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments, showcasing its accuracy across varying noise levels.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has increased the probability, severity, and duration of heat waves and droughts, subsequently escalating the risk of wildfires. Mathematical and computational models can enhance our understanding of wildfire propagation dynamics. In this work, we present a simplified Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) model that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture, and also considers wind, local radiation, natural convection and topography. The model explicitly represents fuel moisture effects by means of the apparent calorific capacity method, distinguishing between live and dead fuel moisture content. Using this model, we conduct exploratory simulations and present theoretical insights into various modeling decisions in the context of ADR-based models. We aim to shed light on the interplay between the different modeled mechanisms in wildfire propagation to identify key factors influencing fire spread and to estimate the model's predictive capacity.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend ISS small-gain theorems from finite networks to countably infinite, locally finite networks. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with an infinite network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results shed more light on the theory of finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general case.</description>
