      <description>arXiv:2409.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Values of density ($\rho$), speed of sound ($c$) and refractive index ($n_{\text{D}}$) for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA) or + butan-1-amine (BA) mixtures at (293.15-303.15) K, and for DMF + N-butylbutan-1-amine (DBA) or hexan-1-amine (HxA) mixtures at 298.15 K are reported. $\rho$ and $c$ measurements were conducted using a vibrating-tube densimeter and sound analyzer, Anton Paar model DSA5000; $n_{\text{D}}$ values were obtained by means of a RFM970 refractometer from Bellingham+Stanley. The experimental $\rho$, $c$ and $n_{\text{D}}$ values have been used to determine excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, excess adiabatic compressibilities, $\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$, excess speeds of sound, $c^{\text{E}}$, excess thermal expansion coefficients, $\alpha_p^{\text{E}}$, and excess refractive indices, $n_{\text{D}}^{\text{E}}$. This set of data shows the existence of interactions between unlike molecules and of structural effects in the mixtures under study. $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of solutions including linear secondary amines are lower than those of mixtures with linear primary amines. In fact, the contribution to $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ from the breaking of amine-amine interactions is larger for the latter systems. Calculations on Rao's constant point out that there is no complex formation between the mixture components. Dispersive interactions have been analyzed by means of the molar refraction. It is shown that solutions with DPA or HxA are characterized by similar dispersive interactions and that they mainly differ in dipolar interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on density, $\rho$, speed of sound, $c$, and refractive index, $n_{\text{D}}$, of binary systems containing N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) + N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA) or + butan-1-amine (BA) at 293.15 K, 298.15 K and 303.15 K, and + N-butylbutan-1-amine (DBA) or + hexan-1-amine (HxA) at 298.15 K are reported. A densimeter and sound analyzer Anton Paar DSA 5000 has been used for the measurement of $\rho$ and $c$, whereas $n_{\text{D}}$ values have been obtained by means of a refractometer RFM970 from Bellingham+Stanley. Also, values of excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, excess isentropic compressibilities, $\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$, excess speeds of sound, $c^{\text{E}}$, excess isobaric thermal expansion coefficients, $\alpha_p^{\text{E}}$, and of excess refractive indices, $n_{\text{D}}^{\text{E}}$, have been determined from these data. The investigated systems are characterized by amide-amine interactions and structural effects, as it is shown by their negative or low positive $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values and by the results from the application of the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson (PFP) model. The breaking of amine-amine interactions is more relevant in systems containing linear primary amines than in those with linear secondary amines, and the $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values are lower for the latter systems. Molar refraction has been used to evaluate the dispersive interactions in the mixtures under study, yielding the result that DPA and HxA systems present similar dispersive interactions and mainly differ in their dipolar character. Steric hindrance of the amide group in DMA leads to weaker amide-amine interactions than in the corresponding N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + amine systems.</description>

      <title>Series Expansion of a Scalable Hermitian Excitonic Renormalization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicitly utilizing the sparsity of the electronic structure problem, fragmentation methods have been heavily researched for decades with great success, pushing the limits of ab initio quantum chemistry ever further. Recently, this set of methods was expanded to include a fundamentally different approach called excitonic renormalization, providing promising initial results. It builds a supersystem Hamiltonian in a second-quantized-like representation from transition-density tensors of isolated fragments, contracted with biorthogonalized molecular integrals. This makes the method fully modular in terms of the quantum chemical methods applied to each fragment and enables massive truncation of the state-space required. Proof-of-principle tests have previously shown that solving for the ground state of an excitonically renormalized Hamiltonian can efficiently scale to hundreds of fragments, but the ad hoc approach that was used to build the Hamiltonian in those tests was not scalable to larger fragments. On the other hand, initial tests of the originally proposed fully modular Hamiltonian build, presented here, have shown the accuracy to be poor on account of its non-Hermitian character. In this study we bridge the gap between these with an operator expansion that is shown to converge rapidly, tending towards a Hermitian Hamiltonian while retaining the modularity, yielding an accurate, scalable method. The accuracy of the Hamiltonian is tested here for a beryllium dimer. At distances near the equilibrium point and longer, the zeroth-order method is comparable to CCSD(T), and the first-order method to FCI. Deviations occurring at shorter bond distances are discussed along with approaches to scaling up to larger fragments.</description>

      <title>Speeds of sound for ($CH_{4}$ + $He$) mixtures from $p$ = (0.5 to 20) MPa at $T$ = (273.16 to 375) K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to provide accurate and wide-ranging experimental new speed of sound data $w$($p$,$T$) of two binary ($CH_{4}$ + $He$) mixtures at a nominal helium content of 5% and 10% at pressures $p$ = (0.5 up to 20) MPa and temperatures $T$ = (273.16, 300, 325, 350 and 375) K. For this purpose, the most accurate technique for determining speed of sound in gas phase has been used: the spherical acoustic resonator. Speed of sound is determined with an overall relative expanded ($k$ = 2) uncertainty of 230 parts in $10^{6}$ and compared to reference models for multicomponent natural gas-like mixtures: AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008 equations of state. Relative deviations of experimental data from model estimations are outside the experimental uncertainty limit, although all points are mostly within the AGA uncertainty of 0.2% and GERG uncertainty of 0.5% and worsen as the helium content increases. Absolute average deviations are better than 0.45% for GERG and below 0.14% for AGA models in (0.95 $CH_{4}$ + 0.05 $He$) mixture and below 0.83% for GERG and within 0.22% for AGA equations in (0.90 $CH_{4}$ + 0.10 $He$) mixture.</description>

      <title>A novel technique based on a cylindrical microwave resonator for high pressure phase equilibrium determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a novel technique based on a cylindrical microwave resonator for high pressure phase equilibrium determination is described. Electric permittivity or dielectric constant is a physical property that depends on temperature and pressure $\epsilon$($p$,$T$). Based on this property, a measuring technique consisting of a cylindrical resonant cavity that works in the microwave spectrum has been developed. Equilibrium data of fluid mixtures are measured at high pressure using a synthetic method, where phase transition is determined under isothermal conditions due to the change of the dielectric constant. This technique may be a more accurate alternative to conventional visual synthetic methods. The technique was validated measuring pure $CO_{2}$, and phase behaviour was then determined for two binary mixtures [$CO_{2}$ (0.6) + $CH_{4}$ (0.4)] and [$CO_{2}$ (0.4) + $CH_{4}$ (0.6)], results for which are presented. These systems are interesting for the study of biogas-like mixtures. In addition, data were compared with the equation of state used for natural gas GERG-2008, and also, they were modelled using Peng-Robinson equation of state and Wong-Sandler mixing rules, which are widely employed in chemical industries and which give good results.</description>

      <title>Unifying the description of hydrocarbons and hydrogenated carbon materials with a chemically reactive machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose machine learning (ML) interatomic potential for carbon and hydrogen which is capable of simulating various materials and molecules composed of these elements. This ML interatomic potential is trained using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework and an extensive dataset of C-H configurations obtained from density functional theory. The dataset is constructed through iterative training and structure-search techniques that generate a broad range of configurations to comprehensively sample the potential energy surface. Furthermore, the dataset is supplemented with relevant bulk, molecular, and high-pressure structures. Finally, long-range van der Waals interactions are added as a locally parametrized model. The accuracy and generality of the potential are validated through the analysis of different simulations under a wide range of conditions, including weak interactions, high temperature, and high pressure. We show that our CH GAP model describes different problems such as the formation of simple and complex alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H), and CH systems at extreme conditions, while retaining good accuracy for pure carbon materials. We use this model to generate hydrocarbons of different sizes and complexity without prior knowledge of organic chemistry rules, and to highlight intrinsic limitations to the simultaneous description on intra and intermolecular interactions within a single computational framework. Our general-purpose ML interatomic potential has the capability to significantly advance research in the field of H-containing carbon materials and compounds, particularly in the areas where longer dynamics, reactivity and large-scale effects may be important.</description>

      <title>Elliptical Silicon Nanowire Covered by the SEI in a 2D Chemo-Mechanical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical interplay between silicon anodes and their surrounding solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essential to improve the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. We model and simulate a 2D elliptical silicon nanowire with SEI via a thermodynamically consistent chemo-mechanical continuum ansatz using a higher order finite element method in combination with a variable-step, variable-order time integration scheme. Considering a soft viscoplastic SEI for three half cycles, we see at the minor half-axis the largest stress magnitude at the silicon nanowire surface, leading to a concentration anomaly. This anomaly is caused by the shape of the nanowire itself and not by the SEI. Also for the tangential stress of the SEI, the largest stress magnitudes are at this point, which can lead to SEI fracture. However, for a stiff SEI, the largest stress magnitude inside the nanowire occurs at the major half-axis, causing a reduced concentration distribution in this area. The largest tangential stress of the SEI is still at the minor half-axis. In total, we demonstrate the importance of considering the mechanics of the anode and SEI in silicon anode simulations and encourage further numerical and model improvements.</description>

      <title>Simulating anharmonic vibrational polaritons beyond the long wavelength approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate anharmonic vibrational polaritons formed due to strong light-matter interactions in an optical cavity between radiation modes and anharmonic vibrations beyond the long-wavelength limit. We introduce a conceptually simple description of light-matter interactions, where spatially localized cavity radiation modes couple to localized vibrations. Within this theoretical framework, we employ self-consistent phonon theory and vibrational dynamical mean-field theory to efficiently simulate momentum-resolved vibrational-polariton spectra, including effects of anharmonicity. Numerical simulations in model systems demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Strong anharmonicity dictates ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-I clathrate solids have attracted significant interest due to their ultralow thermal conductivities and subsequent promise for thermoelectric applications, yet the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well understood. Here, we extend the framework of vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to calculate temperature-dependent thermal transport properties of $X_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where $X=$ Ba, Sr, using a many-body Green's function approach. We find that nonresonant scattering between cage acoustic modes and rattling modes leads to a reduction of acoustic phonon lifetimes and thus thermal conductivities. Moreover, we find that the moderate temperature dependence of conductivities above 300 K, which is consistent with experimental measurements, cannot be reproduced by standard perturbation theory calculations, which predict a $T^{-1}$ dependence. Therefore, we conclude that nonperturbative anharmonic effects, including four- and higher-phonon scattering processes, are responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dingerNet equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require a separate and computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a rotationally invariant total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy allows for an efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, and also incorporates non-BO corrections, through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset superconducting qubits to near their ground states, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>
