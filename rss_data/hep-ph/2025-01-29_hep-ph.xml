      <title>Exclusive semileptonic decays of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons into orbitally and radially excited states of strange and light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semileptonic decays of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons into orbitally and radially excited strange and light mesons are studied in detail within the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and quantum chromodynamics. The hadronic matrix elements of the weak current between meson states are calculated with the consistent account of relativistic effects including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and boosts of the meson wave functions from the rest to moving reference frame. The invariant form factors that parameterize these matrix elements are obtained as the overlap integrals of the initial and final meson wave functions. Their dependence on the square of the transferred momentum $q^2$ is explicitly determined within the whole accessible kinematic range. A convenient analytical approximation for numerical values of form factors is given. These form factors and helicity formalism are employed for the calculation of the differential and total semileptonic decay rates of charm mesons into excited strange and light mesons. Different asymmetry and polarization parameters are also evaluated. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical calculations and available experimental data. Reasonable agreement with experimentally measured semileptonic decay branching fractions and upper bounds is obtained.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Neutrino Mass Ordering and Its Imprint on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino masses may have evolved dynamically throughout the history of the Universe, potentially leading to a mass spectrum distinct from the normal or inverted ordering observed today. While cosmological measurements constrain the total energy density of neutrinos, they are not directly sensitive to a dynamically changing mass ordering unless future surveys achieve exceptional precision in detecting the distinct imprints of each mass eigenstate on large-scale structures. In this work, we investigate the impact of a dynamic neutrino mass spectrum on the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), which is composed of neutrinos from all supernova explosions throughout cosmic history and is on the verge of experimental detection. Since neutrino oscillations are highly sensitive to the mass spectrum, we show that the electron neutrino survival probability carries distinct signatures of the evolving neutrino mass spectrum. Our results indicate that the resulting modifications to the DSNB spectrum would exhibit unique energy-dependent features. These features are distinguishable from the effects of significant astrophysical uncertainties, providing a potential avenue for probing the dynamic nature of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Domain Walls Biased by Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part II. Space-time evolution of linear instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow flavor evolution (defined as driven by neutrino masses and not necessarily ``slow'') is receiving fresh attention in the context of compact astrophysical environments. In Part~I of this series, we have studied the slow-mode dispersion relation following our recently developed analogy to plasma waves. The concept of resonance between flavor waves in the linear regime and propagating neutrinos is the defining feature of this approach. It is best motivated for weak instabilities, which probably is the most relevant regime in self-consistent astrophysical environments because these will try to eliminate the cause of instability. We here go beyond the dispersion relation alone (which by definition applies to infinite media) and consider the group velocities of unstable modes that determines whether the instability relaxes within the region where it first appears (absolute), or away from it (convective). We show that all weak instabilities are convective so that their further evolution is not local. Therefore, studying their consequences numerically in small boxes from given initial conditions may not always be appropriate.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flow-Assisted Nested Sampling on Type-II Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel technique for sampling particle physics model parameter space. The main sampling method applied is Nested Sampling (NS), which is boosted by the application of multiple Machine Learning (ML) networks, e.g., Self-Normalizing Network (SNN) and Normalizing Flow (specifically RealNVP). We apply this on Type-II Seesaw model to test the efficacy of the algorithm. We present the results of our detailed Bayesian exploration of the model parameter space subjected to theoretical constraints and experimental data corresponding to the 125 GeV Higgs boson, $\rho$-parameter, and the oblique parameters.</description>

      <title>High Energy Vector Boson Scattering in Four-Body Final States to Probe Higgs Cubic, Quartic, and HEFT interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the energy scales of perturbative unitarity violation in various $2 \to 4$ vector boson scattering (VBS) processes and compare them to lower multiplicity processes. The final states include $h^4$, $V_L V_L h h$, and $V_L^4$, where $V_L$ represents the longitudinal mode of $Z$ or $W$ boson, and $h$ the Higgs boson. We consider scenarios with modified cubic and quartic Higgs self-couplings, including those derived from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), as well as scenarios involving derivative operators from Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). Modified Higgs self-couplings typically lead to perturbative unitarity violation in at least the $2\to 3$ VBS; however, the corresponding energy scales of unitarity violation are often very high. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of modified Higgs potentials, $2\to4$ processes exhibit significantly lower energy scales of unitarity violation compared to $2 \to 3$ processes. This, combined with the fact that the cross sections of $2 \to 4$ processes increase with energy, suggests they generate more signal events at high energies, $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gtrsim 2$ TeV, which could be achieved in future colliders. In contrast, for HEFT derivative interactions, higher multiplicity offers diminished benefits, as $2 \to 4$ cross sections are often smaller than those of related $2 \to 3$ processes within the valid energy range. This study shows that $2 \to 4$ VBS processes are particularly compelling for probing Higgs potential modification, including the cubic and quartic couplings, but are less advantageous when derivative interactions dominate.</description>

      <title>Light scalar beyond the Higgs mixing limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the interactions of a light scalar singlet, which mixes with the Standard Model~(SM) Higgs, also receive other UV contributions of comparable size. We focus, in particular, on the flavor aligned limit, where couplings of the light scalar to the SM are almost flavor diagonal, but not necessarily proportional to the Higgs Yukawa couplings. The phenomenology of such a general flavor aligned light scalar differs from both the Higgs-mixed scalar, as well as from a general axion-like particle. We explore this for light scalar masses below a few hundred MeV, such that they can be produced in kaon decays, and in decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, and the transitions described using chiral perturbation theory. We then derive constraints on the light scalar interactions, assuming that light scalar decays are either just into photons or are invisible. We also discuss several UV examples of such light scalar models: a two-Higgs doublet model extended by a light scalar, a light dilaton from the dark sector, and a SM extended by heavy vector-like quarks and a light scalar. For the latter we also performed matching onto low energy theory at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Hadronization -- A Study of In-Medium Hadronization of Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretical approach to neutral pion contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic light-by-light scattering induces a substantial contribution to the muon $g-2$ with present accuracy of its measurement. The effect caused by the neutral pion through this scattering on the muon $g-2$ has been scrutinized intensively by model calculation and lattice QCD simulation. All of those estimates have been done based on one formula, but it has one pathological aspect. The purpose of this article is to resolve such a pathology from a field-theoretical approach, i.e., by defining the effect in question as the neutral pion intermediate state contribution to the QCD vacuum expectation value of time-ordered product of four electromagnetic currents. It leads (1) the pion pole term corresponding to the imaginary part of the pion propagator $\frac{1}{q^2 - m_\pi^2 + \mathrm{i} \epsilon}$, (2) and no principle value term corresponding to its real part.</description>

      <title>Polarized Dissociation and Spin Alignment of Moving Quarkonium in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have found spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in heavy ion collisions, suggesting a medium effect that is spin dependent. We propose a possible mechanism with polarized dissociation from the motion of $J/\psi$ with respect to the medium. We calculate polarized dissociation rate for quarkonium spin triplet state from spin chromomagnetic coupling in the potential non-relativistic QCD framework. This is done for the leading order gluo-dissociation process and next to leading order inelastic Coulomb scattering process. The polarized dissociation rate is expressed as a function of relative velocity between quarkonium and QGP and the quantization axis. Applying the polarized dissociation rate to quarkonium evolution with dissociation effect only in a Bjorken flow, we find the spin $0$ state to dissociate less than the other spin states, leading to positive $\rho_{00}-1/3$. Regeneration contribution is expected to give a contribution with the opposite sign.</description>

      <title>New molecular bonds existing in the strong interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to the covalent bond in chemical molecules induced by shared electrons, we proposed in [Commun. Theor. Phys. 74 (2022) 125201] the hadronic covalent bond induced by shared light quarks to explain the $T_{cc}(3875)$ and the deuteron. In this paper we improve and extend this mechanism to explain the $Z_c(3900)$, which is bound by the shared light quark-antiquark pair along with sea quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. Our analysis is based on the following forward and backward reasoning: a hadronic molecule exists, iff the attraction between its components is strong enough, iff the wave functions of its components significantly overlap with each other, iff the Pauli principle is well satisfied among all the shared quarks and antiquarks. Additionally, the $X(3872)$ is so unique that we need to further consider the annihilation of the shared light quark-antiquark pair, just in line with the reasoning that the production and annihilation of sea quark-antiquark pairs should be given equal consideration. Both the production and annihilation molecular bonds exist only in the strong interaction, not in the electromagnetic interaction, and they provide a quasi-static low-energy platform for studying the QCD confinement.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral bag model provides a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory resides, as previously conjectured. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory corresponds to the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To obtain the correct net baryon number for the total chiral bag, vector meson field interactions occur on the bag surface and extend outside the bag. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons should be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the valence quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, pion, in an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature by employing a light-cone quark model. The medium modifications in the unpolarized GPDs have been incorporated by taking inputs from the chiral SU($3$) quark mean field model. The electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and charge radii have been calculated for both the vacuum and in-medium cases. These results are found to be in agreement with the available experimental data and other model predictions.</description>

      <title>Chiral oscillations in finite time quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how chiral oscillations of a massive Dirac field can be described within quantum field theory using a finite-time interaction picture approach, where the mass term in the Lagrangian is treated as a perturbative coupling between massless fields of definite chirality. We derive the formula for chiral oscillations at the fourth order in the perturbative expansion, obtaining a result consistent with the formula derived by means of other methods. Furthermore, we illustrate how the perturbative framework of chiral oscillations can effectively describe production processes where an electron must exhibit both left chirality and positive helicity, as in decay $\pi^- \to e^- + {\bar \nu}_e$. Finally, we argue that, in this perturbative view, chiral oscillations are also essential for detecting the decay products in such processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, which is distinct from standard perturbative expectations, and determine its corresponding spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Observing Hot Holographic Quark Star With Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model, which could form the core of a stable compact star. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves and distinguished by properties like nonzero tidal Love number and electromagnetic signals.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization Group Equations in Generic Effective Field Theories. Part I: Bosonic Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of effective quantum field theories with arbitrary gauge groups and scalar matter fields. In such theories, we derive the one-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for the physical dimension-six operators. The present paper is the first one in a series that is going to cover theories with spin-$\frac12$ matter fields, too, including the phenomenologically most relevant SMEFT and LEFT cases. Our present approach provides tools for deriving the yet unknown two-loop RGEs in the SMEFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>Mass gap in non-perturbative quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity via Dyson-Schwinger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large coupling. The model is obtained by looking for conformally flat solutions. The model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. Assuming a Fubini-Lipatov instanton for the vacuum instead, the spectrum is given by an infinite set of excitations of finite mass. In both cases, the model develops a mass gap due to the presence of the quadratic Ricci scalar, after the breaking of the conformal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

      <title>Left-hand cut and the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the left-hand cut (LHC) problem is treated in the HAL QCD method. For this purpose, we first consider the effect of the LHC to the scattering problem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics with potentials. We show that the $S$-matrix or the scattering phase shift obtained from the potential including the Yukawa term ($e^{- m_\pi r}/r$) with the infra-red (IR) cutoff $R$ is well-defined even for the complex momentum $k$ as long as $R$ is finite, and they are compared with those obtained by the analytic continuation without the IR cutoff. In the $R\to\infty$ limit, the phase shift approaches the result from the analytic continuation at ${\rm Im}\, k &lt; m_\pi/2$, while they differ at ${\rm Im}\, k &gt; m_\pi/2$, except $k= k_b$, where $k_b$ is the binding momentum. We also observe that $k_b$ can be correctly obtained even at finite but large $R$. Using knowledge obtained in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we present how we should treat the LHC in the HAL QCD potential method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger and Cosmological Constraints on Dark Matter through Two-Fluid Neutron Star Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. Employing NM equations of state spanning a wide range of stiffness and a self-interacting asymmetric fermionic DM framework, we explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. Constraints from gravitational waves (GW170817), NICER X-ray measurements (PSR J0030+0451), and pulsar mass limits (PSR J0740+6620) delineate a consistent parameter space for DM properties derived from these multi-messenger observations. DM halo-dominated configurations, while consistent with PSR J0740+6620's mass limits and NICER's radius measurements for PSR J0030+0451, are ruled out by the tidal deformability bounds inferred from the GW170817 event. Consequently, the combined limits inferred from the observational data of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620 support the plausibility of DM core-dominated configurations. Constraints on the DM self-interaction strength from galaxy cluster dynamics further refine the DM parameter space permitted by NS observations. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Impact of light sterile neutrinos on cosmological large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16908v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos with masses on the $\mathrm{eV}$ scale are promising candidates to account for the origin of neutrino mass and the reactor neutrino anomalies. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos in the early universe could result in a large abundance of relic sterile neutrinos, which depends on not only their physical mass $m_{\rm phy}$ but also their degree of thermalization, characterized by the extra effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the effects of sterile neutrinos on the matter power spectrum, halo pairwise velocity, and halo mass and velocity functions. We find that the presence of sterile neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum and halo mass and velocity functions, but enhance the halo pairwise velocity. We also provide fitting formulae to quantify these effects.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

Abstract: The idea of reduction of couplings consists in the search for relations between seemingly independent couplings of a renormalizable theory that are renormalization group invariant. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of such 1-loop relations among the top Yukawa, the Higgs quartic and the gauge colour couplings of the Type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model at a high-energy boundary. The phenomenological viability of the reduced theory suggests the value of $\tan\beta$ and the scale in which new physics may appear.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Wormholes from Domain Wall Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) are topological defects originating from phase transitions in the early universe. In the presence of an energy imbalance between distinct vacua, enclosed DW cavities shrink until the entire network disappears. By studying the dynamics of thin-shell bubbles in General Relativity, we demonstrate that closed DWs with sizes exceeding the cosmic horizon tend to annihilate later than the average. This delayed annihilation allows for the formation of large overdensities, which, upon entering the Hubble horizon, eventually collapse to form Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). We rely on 3D percolation theory to calculate the number density of these late-annihilating DWs, enabling us to infer the abundance of PBHs. A key insight from our study is that DW networks with the potential to emit observable Gravitational Waves are also likely to yield detectable PBHs. Additionally, we find that wormholes connected to baby-universes can be produced and conclude on the possibility to generate a multiverse.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production via gravity-portal.We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_{a}$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_{a}\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Implications of Sgr A$^\ast$ on the $\gamma$-rays searches of Bino Dark Matter with $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of dark matter density spike around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A$^*$, in probing the Bino-dominated neutralino dark matter (DM) $\tilde \chi_1^0$ within the MSSM, which typically produces relatively faint signals in the conventional DM halos. In particular, we explore the indirect search prospects of sub-TeV Bino-Higgsino and Bino-Wino-Higgsino DM in the MSSM, consistent with the supersymmetric predictions required to explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Typical over-abundance of Bino DM is ameliorated with slepton and/or Wino coannihilations. The lightest neutralino, thus, may be associated with a compressed supersymmetric particle spectrum, which, in general, is difficult to probe at conventional LHC searches. Similarly, for a rather tiny Higgsino mixing, $\tilde \chi_1^0$ does not offer much prospect to assess its predictions at dark matter direct detection searches. Accommodating the inclusive effects of density spike, here, we present the requisite boost factor to facilitate $\gamma-$ray searches of Bino-dominated DM in the MSSM, especially focusing on the Fermi-LAT and HESS observations.</description>

      <title>A method to include exclusive heavy vector-meson production data at small $x$ in global parton analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method which allows the inclusion of exclusive heavy vector-meson production data at low $x$ in future global parton analyses. As an example we perform a study within xFitter to determine the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) at next-to-leading order (NLO) at moderate-to-low $x$ using the measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$ production in ep and pp collisions from HERA and LHC. We further study the constraints from the corresponding $\Upsilon$ production process. We finish by discussing the possible effects at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) through incorporation of a K factor for the exclusive heavy vector-meson coefficient function at NLO.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived light neutralinos and axionlike particles at the SHiNESS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Soleti et al. [JHEP03(2024)148] proposed a new experiment called SHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use of the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search for hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise with distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron pairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs). At the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays at rest of $\pi^+$ mesons and $\mu^+$ leptons. We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of long-lived light neutralinos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived weak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced from decays of $\pi^+$ and $\mu^+$. Since the $\pi^+$'s and $\mu^+$'s decay at rest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced LLPs, and thus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these two scenarios. Our calculation shows that in multiple relevant benchmark scenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the existing bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $W^+ W^+$ production in association with three jets at NLO QCD matched with parton shower</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading order QCD calculation for the electroweak production of a pair of same-sign weak gauge bosons in association with three jets in the region dominated by vector boson scattering, and its matching with parton-shower programs according to the POWHEG formalism. Our calculation allows for an accurate description of jet observables crucial for the optimization of experimental analyses of vector boson scattering processes. We find QCD corrections and parton-shower effects moderate in size for inclusive quantities and distributions of the tagging jets. A larger impact of these corrections is observed for subleading jets.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy neutral leptons coupled to axion-like particles at the LHC far detectors and SHiP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hidden-sector models, axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), leading to rich phenomenologies. We study ALPs produced from $D$- and $B$-meson decays via quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decaying exclusively into a pair of HNLs which mix with active neutrinos. The ALP can be either short- or long-lived, depending on the masses of the ALP and the HNL, as well as the corresponding coupling strength. Such GeV-scale HNLs are necessarily long-lived given the current bounds on their mixing parameters. We assess the sensitivities of the LHC far detectors and SHiP, to the long-lived HNLs in such theoretical scenarios. We find that for currently allowed values of the ALP couplings, most of these experiments can probe the active-sterile-neutrino mixing parameters multiple orders of magnitude beyond the present bounds, covering large parameter region targeted with the type-I seesaw mechanism. In addition, our results show that compared to the case of a promptly decaying ALP, assuming an ALP of longer lifetimes weakens the sensitivities of the considered experiments to the long-lived HNLs.</description>

      <title>Long-lived sterile neutrinos from an axionlike particle at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axionlike particles (ALPs) can be produced in meson decays via tree-level quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decay to a pair of sterile neutrinos if also coupled to them. Such light sterile neutrinos are necessarily long-lived and may give rise to striking signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) at terrestrial experiments. In this work, we study the prospect of the ongoing Belle II experiment for detecting the sterile neutrinos from the ALP, leveraging the $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ $B$-mesons projected to be produced at the experiment with an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$. We propose search strategies for one or two DVs, and perform Monte-Carlo simulations in order to estimate the sensitivity reach of Belle II to active-sterile-neutrino mixing $|V_{eN}|^2$ as functions of the sterile-neutrino mass. Signatures include a selected list of sterile-neutrino final states, for which we estimate an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ or lower background level. Our results show that the proposed search strategies can probe values of $|V_{eN}|^2$ up to about two orders of magnitude beyond the existing bounds, for ALP mass over 4 GeV and sterile-neutrino mass above the $D$-meson threshold. Compared to the one-DV search, the two-DV one, despite its weaker sensitivities as a result of double exponential suppression of the sterile-neutrino decay positions, possesses the advantage of possible full reconstruction of the signal event allowing for pinning down the masses of the sterile neutrino and the ALP, if a discovery is made.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD effects on angular observables in single Higgs production at electron-proton collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of the Higgs boson ($H$) at current and future particle colliders are crucial to explore new physics beyond the standard model. In particular, experimental and theoretical outlooks at future colliders drive interest in Higgs to gauge boson couplings. Single Higgs production via vector-boson fusion allows probing Higgs couplings with massive vector bosons ($V = W, Z$). We consider electron-proton (eP) collider to study these couplings due to the low background. In a recent study, we considered the most general anomalous Higgs-vector boson ($HVV$) couplings and explored the potential of eP collider in constraining the parameters of $HVV$ couplings. Our results were based on leading order predictions in perturbation theory. We include further Next to Leading Order (NLO) corrections of Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) in Standard Model signal to make precise predictions. In this talk, I will present the effect of NLO QCD corrections on the standard model and anomalous $HVV$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Elastic Neutrino-electron Scattering at the One-loop Level in the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a complete calculation of the differential cross section for elastic neutrino-electron scattering at the one-loop level in the Standard Model (SM), by using up-to-date values of relevant input parameters in the on-shell renormalization scheme. A careful comparison with the calculation done by Sarantakos, Sirlin and Marciano more than forty years ago in the same scheme is carried out, and an excellent agreement is found if the same values of input parameters are taken. Then we apply our results to compute the event rates for the detection of reactor antineutrinos in both JUNO and TAO experiments, which are now under construction and will soon be in operation. It should be emphasized that one-loop radiative corrections in the SM must be taken into account in the first place when searching for possible new-physics effects in the coming era of precision neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Black Hole from Entropy Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00602v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One quantum characterization of a black hole motivated by (local) holography and thermodynamics is that it maximizes thermodynamic entropy for a given surface area. In the context of quantum gravity, this could be more fundamental than the classical characterization by a horizon. As a step, we explore this possibility by solving the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation with many matter fields. For highly-excited spherically-symmetric static configurations, we apply local typicality and estimate the entropy including self-gravity to derive its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely determines the entropy-maximized configuration: self-gravitating quanta condensate into a radially-uniform dense configuration with no horizon, where the self-gravity and a large quantum pressure induced by the curvatures are balanced and no singularity appears. The interior metric is a self-consistent and non-perturbative solution in Planck's constant. The maximum entropy, given by the volume integral of the entropy density, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula through self-gravity, deriving the Bousso bound for thermodynamic entropy. Finally, 10 future prospects are discussed, leading to a speculative view that the configuration represents a quantum-gravitational condensate in a semi-classical manner.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) is the creation of particles in an expanding universe due solely to their gravitational interaction. These particles can play an important role in the cosmic history through their connection to various cosmological relics including dark matter, gravitational wave radiation, dark radiation, and the baryon asymmetry. This review explains the phenomenon of CGPP as a consequence of quantum fields in a time-dependent background, catalogs known results for the spectra and cosmological abundance of gravitationally produced particles of various spins, and explores the phenomenological consequences and observational signatures of CGPP.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Gravitational Wave Bounds from Galactic Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGWs) constitute a unique window on the early Universe as well as exotic astrophysical objects. If the current gravitational wave experiments are more dedicated to the low frequency regime, the graviton conversion into photons in a strong magnetic field constitutes a powerful tool to probe HFGWs. In this paper, we show that neutron stars, due to their extreme magnetic field, are a perfect laboratory to study the conversion of HFGWs into photons. Using realistic models for the galactic neutron star population, we calculate for the first time the expected photon flux induced by the conversion of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the magnetosphere of the ensemble of neutron stars present in the Milky Way. We compare this photon flux to the observed one from several telescopes and derive upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave background in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{25}\, \rm Hz$. We find our limits to be competitive in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{15}\, \rm Hz$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, under the hypothesis that quark matter may not be strange (Holdom et al. 2018), we adopt a modification of the coupling constant of the four-quark scalar interaction $G\rightarrow G_1+G_2\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ in the 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to study nonstrange hybrid stars, where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are two parameters constrained by using the lattice QCD simulation results at the critical temperature and zero chemical potential. The Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. It is found that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing $0.026-0.04$ solar mass. The maximum hybrid star mass in the framework of the modified NJL model is about 0.1 solar mass lighter than that in the conventional 2-flavor NJL model. It is argued that the binary neutron stars in GW170817 should be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); the theory is the perturbative part of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions. The theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) to $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry provides a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

Abstract: An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charmed hadrons in QGP from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour, which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., one whose speed of sound in the rest frame differs from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory and In-In Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissipative anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.</description>
