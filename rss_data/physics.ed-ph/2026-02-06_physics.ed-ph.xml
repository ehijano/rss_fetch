      <title>Evidence-Based Education and Beyond: The Critical Role of Theory in Science Education Research and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence-based education has become a central concept in science education, with meta-analyses often regarded as the gold standard for informing practice. This emphasis raises critical questions concerning the applicability, generalizability and transferability of research findings into classroom practice. It remains unclear both what kind of evidence education should be based on and whether science education research can provide the type of evidence required to guide decisions at different levels. This paper argues that theories play a crucial role in building bridges between research and practice. Drawing on literature from science education and the philosophy of science, we contrast the explanatory scope of meta-analyses with the predictive and integrative potential of theories, understood in a structuralist sense as systems of models with defined domains of applicability. We propose that science education research requires both fundamental and applied research, each contributing to theory development at different levels, ranging from local and context-specific models to more fundamental theoretical frameworks. Importantly, we argue that theories in science education should not be viewed merely as applications of psychological or pedagogical theories, but as fundamental theories in their own right. We conclude that the future development of science education research may benefit more from the systematic refinement and integration of theories than from the continued accumulation of isolated local findings, and we propose ways to support the development of such theories. A theory-guided understanding of evidence-based education can strengthen the scientific foundations of the field while simultaneously enhancing its practical relevance, thereby helping to narrow the long-standing theory-practice gap.</description>

      <title>On the design of a profession-oriented course on Theoretical Mechanics for physics education students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a profession-oriented course we offered at the University of Vienna, aimed at physics education teacher students. The course on Theoretical Classical Mechanics has been conceived and designed from its outset with the explicit goal of bridging the gap between the abstract, mathematical notions employed in Theoretical Physics with the concrete future needs of prospective teachers in their profession. We aimed at countering both the negative attitudes of students towards Theoretical Physics and the interrelated skepticism of professors regarding the students mathematical proficiency. Our main findings are that these goals can indeed be achieved through a careful selection of course material and the associated mathematical tools, by closely interwoven lecture topics and exercises, and thorough planning according to principles for high-school teaching known from science education research. Establishing close connections between the material taught in the course and the students future occupation as high-school teachers has proven to be of utmost importance. This is possible without any sacrifice of mathematical rigor or of the quality of Physics presented.</description>
