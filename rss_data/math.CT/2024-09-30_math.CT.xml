      <title>The Quillen negation monoid of a category, and Schreier graphs of its action on classes of morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free monoid with two generators acts on classes (=properties) of morphisms of a category by taking the left or right orthogonal complement with respect to the lifting property, and we define the Quillen negation monoid of the category to be its largest quotient which acts faithfully. We consider the category of topological spaces and show that a number of natural properties of continuous maps are obtained by applying this action to a single example.
  Namely, for the category of topological spaces we show finiteness of the orbit of the simplest class of morphisms { \emptyset \to {*} }, and we calculate its Schreier graph. The orbit consists of 21 classes of morphisms, and most of these classes are explicitly defined by standard terminology from a typical first year course of topology: a map having a section or dense image; quotient and induced topology; surjective, injective; (maps representing) subsets, closed subsets; disjoint union, disjoint union with a discrete space; each fibre satisfying separation axiom T0 or T1 . Also, the notions of being connected, having a generic point, and being a complete lattice, can be defined in terms of the classes in the orbit.
  In particular, calculating parts of this orbit can be used in an introductory course as exercises connecting basic definitions in topology and category theory.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>
