      <title>Through the Looking Glass: Bitcoin Treasury Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin treasury companies have taken stock markets by storm amassing billions of dollars worth of tokens. More than a hundred companies active in various crypto-tokens, not just Bitcoin, are listed. The ability to generate leverage, for example stemming from borrowing collateralized by stock portfolios, helps to understand this phenomenon.
  In addition, the extension of the binary-choice Kelly criterion to incorporate uncertainty in the form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence or more generally Bregman divergence is studied.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal review of portfolios with minimum variance approach before during and after the pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the pandemic on the most traded stocks in the Colombian stock market for the date of January 17, 2024. Based on the daily data of the most traded companies in Colombia for said date and covering a period general from 2015 to 2023, in a summarized way our analysis reveals that in the period 2015-2019, the return reached 5.70%, with a relatively low risk of 18.45%. However, in the following period 2016 -2020, although the yield decreased to 5.40%, the risk experienced a significant increase, reaching 24.64%. The beta also showed variations, being lowest in 2015-2019 with 0.61 and increasing to 1.02 in 2016-2020. The capital market line (LMC) in the constructed portfolios has a downward trend, indicating that the portfolio offers an expected rate of return lower than the risk-free rate. This finding is supported by the Sharpe index, which shows negative values throughout the periods studied.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a few state variables (~3-6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework. Our framework accurately captures both myopic demand and complex intertemporal hedging demands, a feat often elusive for other methods in high-dimensional settings. P-PGDPO delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for a broad class of high-dimensional continuous-time control problems. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to directly inform neural network-based policy learning. A key contribution is our highly efficient Projected PG-DPO (P-PGDPO) variant. This approach uniquely utilizes BPTT to obtain rapidly stabilizing estimates of the Pontryagin costates and their crucial derivatives with respect to the state variables. These estimates are then analytically projected onto the manifold of optimal controls dictated by PMP's first-order conditions, significantly reducing training overhead and enhancing accuracy. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that P-PGDPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables).</description>

      <title>Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&amp;P 500.</description>
