      <title>Relativistic Embedded Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approach to the Core-Ionized States of Actinides: A Case Study of Uranyl(VI) in Cs$_2$UO$_2$Cl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the core-level ionization energies of the bare uranyl ion (UO$_2^{2+}$) and its interaction with X-rays when it is hosted in the Cs$_2$UO$_2$Cl$_4$ crystalline environment using a recent implementation of the core-valence-separated relativistic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method (CVS-EOM-CC). Our study evaluates different relativistic Hamiltonians, assesses basis set and virtual space truncation effects, and examines the role of orbital correlation and relaxation in simulating the spectroscopic observables. The results of this investigation highlight the importance of computing two-electron interactions beyond the zeroth-order truncation (i.e. the Coulomb term) when working in the tender and hard X-ray ranges. Additionally, we compare different structural models using the frozen density embedding method (FDE). By contrasting the bare and embedded uranyl models, we observe significant changes in binding energies, highlighting the influence of the equatorial ligands of the uranyl ion on its spectroscopic observables. A comparison between the embedded uranyl and supermolecular systems, excluding the cesium atoms, reveals systematic differences, with binding energy variations from experimental data remaining within 10 eV. Notably, the computed spin-orbit splittings for U $4d$ and $4f$ deviate by less than 0.7 eV, demonstrating the validity of this protocol for computing binding energies in the soft X-ray range.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing in Corrosion Modeling: Bridging Research and Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion presents a major challenge to the longevity and reliability of products across various industries, particularly in the aerospace sector. Corrosion arises from chemical processes occurring on an atomistic scale, which lead to macroscopic degradation. Addressing this issue requires multi-scale modeling approaches, which rely on microscopic parameters that are challenging to measure experimentally or model with conventional quantum chemistry techniques.
  In this work, we develop and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical workflow tailored for atomistic simulations of corrosion processes, with a specific focus on the initial step of the oxygen reduction reaction -- a critical trigger for the corrosion of aluminum alloys widely used in modern aircraft. Using a combination of classical quantum chemistry methods and quantum computing frameworks, we identify reaction geometries characterized by multi-configurational electronic structures that are ideal for exploring with quantum algorithms.
  For the first time in this context, we explore both noisy intermediate-scale quantum and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for these multi-configurational system, integrating them within a workflow designed to bridge atomistic simulations with macroscopic modeling approaches, such as finite element methods. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed quantum resource estimation to assess when and how quantum computers may play a meaningful role in tackling these problems.
  Our results demonstrate that significant advancements in quantum hardware but also in algorithms and error correction techniques are needed to make quantum computation practically viable for this class of problems. Nevertheless, this work establishes a critical foundation for applying quantum computation to corrosion modeling and highlights its potential to address complex, business-relevant challenges in materials science.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Accelerated Surface Exploration of Reconstructed BiVO$_{4}$(010) and Characterization of Their Aqueous Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the semiconductor-electrolyte interface in photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems is crucial for optimizing stability and reactivity. Despite the challenges in establishing reliable surface structure models during PEC cycles, this study explores the complex surface reconstructions of BiVO$_{4}$(010) by employing a computational workflow integrated with a state-of-the-art active learning protocol for a machine-learning interatomic potential and global optimization techniques. Within this workflow, we identified 494 unique reconstructed surface structures that surpass conventional chemical intuition-driven, bulk-truncated models. After constructing the surface Pourbaix diagram under Bi- and V-rich electrolyte conditions using density functional theory and hybrid functional calculations, we proposed structural models for the experimentally observed Bi-rich BiVO$_{4}$ surfaces. By performing hybrid functional molecular dynamics simulations with explicit treatment of water molecules on selected reconstructed BiVO$_{4}$(010) surfaces, we observed spontaneous water dissociation, marking the first theoretical report of this phenomenon. Our findings demonstrate significant water dissociation on reconstructed Bi-rich surfaces, highlighting the critical role of bare and under-coordinated Bi sites (only observable in reconstructed surfaces) in driving hydration processes. Our work establishes a foundation for understanding the role of complex, reconstructed Bi surfaces in surface hydration and reactivity. Additionally, our theoretical framework for exploring surface structures and predicting reactivity in multicomponent oxides offers a precise approach to describing complex surface and interface processes in PEC systems.</description>

      <title>A computational framework to predict weld integrity and microstructural heterogeneity: application to hydrogen transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel computational framework to assess the structural integrity of welds. In the first stage of the simulation framework, local fractions of microstructural constituents within weld regions are predicted based on steel composition and welding parameters. The resulting phase fraction maps are used to define heterogeneous properties that are subsequently employed in structural integrity assessments using an elastoplastic phase field fracture model. The framework is particularised to predicting failure in hydrogen pipelines, demonstrating its potential to assess the feasibility of repurposing existing pipeline infrastructure to transport hydrogen. First, the process model is validated against experimental microhardness maps for vintage and modern pipeline welds. Additionally, the influence of welding conditions on hardness and residual stresses is investigated, demonstrating that variations in heat input, filler material composition, and weld bead order can significantly affect the properties within the weld region. Coupled hydrogen diffusion-fracture simulations are then conducted to determine the critical pressure at which hydrogen transport pipelines will fail. To this end, the model is enriched with a microstructure-sensitive description of hydrogen transport and hydrogen-dependent fracture resistance. The analysis of an X52 pipeline reveals that even 2 mm defects in a hard heat-affected zone can drastically reduce the critical failure pressure.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Path Search Algorithm on Free-Energy Landscape using Random Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multidimensional free-energy or potential-energy landscape, finding reaction paths that connect an initial (or reactant) state and a final (or product) state is important for biophysics and materials science. The likelihood of a path can be evaluated using an objective function, and the most likely reaction path can be found by optimizing its objective function. However, nonlinear optimization on a complex free-energy or potential-energy landscape may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this study, this drawback is avoided using deterministic path-finding methods such as Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph by assigning grids on the coordinate system to graph nodes and relating the objective function of the path to the edge cost between the nodes. Furthermore, the use of random grids is proposed because they more accurately represent paths than regular grids. As a demonstration, the proposed method is successfully applied to find the minimum resistance path on a three-hole potential model, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Parahydrogen-Induced Hyperpolarization Effects in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear spin hyperpolarization utilizing parahydrogen has the potential for broad applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine. This review examines recent chemical and biochemical insights gained using parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). We begin with photo-induced PHIP, which allows the investigation of short-lived and photo-activated catalysis. Next, we review the partially negative line effect, in which distinctive lineshape helps to reveal information about rapid exchange with parahydrogen and the role of short-lived catalytic species. The NMR signal enhancement of a single proton in oneH-PHIP is discussed, challenging the underpinning concept of the necessity of pairwise hydrogenation. Furthermore, we examine metal-free PHIP facilitated by novel molecular tweezers and radicaloids, demonstrating alternative routes to conventional hydrogenation using metal-based catalysts. Although symmetric molecules incorporating parahydrogen are NMR silent, we showcase methods that reveal hyperpolarized states through post-hydrogenation reactions. We discuss chemical exchange processes that mediate polarization transfer between parahydrogen and a molecular target, expanding the reach of PHIP without synthesizing specialized precursors. We conclude this review by highlighting the role of PHIP in uncovering the H2 activation mechanisms of hydrogenases. By providing a detailed review of these diverse phenomena, we aim to familiarize the reader with the versatility of PHIP and its potential applications for mechanistic studies and chemical analysis.</description>

      <title>Pooling Solvent Mixtures for Solvation Free Energy Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solvation free energy is an important design parameter in reaction kinetics and separation processes, making it a critical property to predict during process development. In previous research, directed message passing neural networks (D-MPNN) have successfully been used to predict solvation free energies and enthalpies in organic solvents. However, solvent mixtures provide greater flexibility for optimizing solvent interactions than monosolvents. This work aims to extend our previous models to mixtures. To handle mixtures in a permutation invariant manner we propose a pooling function; MolPool. With this pooling function, the machine learning models can learn and predict properties for an arbitrary number of molecules. The novel SolProp-mix software that applies MolPool to D-MPNN was compared to state-of-the-art architectures for predicting mixture properties and validated with our new database of COSMOtherm calculations; BinarySolv-QM. To improve predictions towards experimental accuracy, the network was then fine-tuned on experimental data in monosolvents. To demonstrate the benefit of this transfer learning methodology, experimental datasets of solvation free energies in binary (BinarySolv-Exp) and ternary (TernarySolv-Exp) solvent mixtures were compiled from data on vapor-liquid equilibria and activity coefficients. The neural network performed better than COSMOtherm calculations with an MAE of 0.25 kcal/mol and an RMSE of 0.37 kcal/mol for non-aqueous mixed solvents. Additionally, the ability to capture trends for a varying mixture composition was validated successfully. Our model's ability to accurately predict mixture properties from the combination of in silico data and pure component experimental data is promising given the scarcity of experimental data for mixtures in many fields.</description>

      <title>A coupled-trajectory approach for decoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the issues of decoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping. We demonstrate that moving away from an independent-trajectory picture is the strategy which allows us to propose a robust surface hopping scheme overcoming all these issues at once. Based on the exact factorization and on the idea of coupled trajectories, we consider the swarm of trajectories, that mimic the nuclear dynamics in nonadiabatic processes, as a unique entity. In this way, imposing energy conservation of the swarm and allowing the trajectories to share energy when hops occur clearly indicates the route towards a new surface hopping scheme. Encouraging results are reported, in terms of electronic and vibrational time-dependent properties on the photodynamics of fulvene, modeled with a full-dimensional linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian.</description>
