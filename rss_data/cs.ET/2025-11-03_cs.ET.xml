      <title>Lorentzian Switching Dynamics in HZO-based FeMEMS Synapses for Neuromorphic Weight Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing demands synaptic elements that can store and update weights with high precision while being read non-destructively. Conventional ferroelectric synapses store weights in remnant polarization states and might require destructive electrical readout, limiting endurance and reliability. We demonstrate a ferroelectric MEMS (FeMEMS) based synapse in which analog weights are stored in the piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31,eff}$ of a released Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) MEMS unimorph. Partial switching of ferroelectric domains modulates $d_{31,eff}$, and a low-amplitude mechanical drive reads out the weight without read-disturb in the device yielding more than 7-bit of programming levels. The mechanical switching distribution function follows a Lorentzian distribution as a logarithmic function of partial poling voltage ($V_p$) consistent with nucleation-limited switching (NLS), and the median threshold extracted from electromechanical data obeys a Merz-type field-time law with a dimensionless exponent $\alpha = 3.62$. These relationships establish a quantitative link between mechanical weights and electrical switching kinetics. This mechanically read synapse avoids depolarization and charge-injection effects, provides bipolar weights (well suited for excitatory and inhibitory synapses), directly reveals partial domain populations, and offers a robust, energy-efficient route toward high-bit neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Superdirectivity in Planar Holographic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the superdirectivity characteristics of uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) for holographic multiple-input multiple-output systems. By establishing a mathematical directivity model for the URA, an analytical expression for the maximum directivity is derived. Accordingly, systematic analysis is performed in conjunction with numerical simulations. Results show that the directivity can be significantly enhanced via rational utilization of coupling effects. However, this enhancement yields diminishing returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design of superdirective URAs and offers valuable insights for holographic array optimization in 5G/6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Investigation of Crosstalk in Bent Microstrip Lines with Partial and Apertured Shielding: Simulations and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.</description>

      <title>Joint Visible Light and Backscatter Communications for Proximity-Based Indoor Asset Tracking Enabled by Energy-Neutral Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In next-generation wireless systems, providing location-based mobile computing services for energy-neutral devices has become a crucial objective for the provision of sustainable Internet of Things (IoT). Visible light positioning (VLP) has gained great research attention as a complementary method to radio frequency (RF) solutions since it can leverage ubiquitous lighting infrastructure. However, conventional VLP receivers often rely on photodetectors or cameras that are power-hungry, complex, and expensive. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid indoor asset tracking system that integrates visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) within a simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) framework. We design a low-complexity and energy-neutral IoT node, namely backscatter device (BD) which harvests energy from light-emitting diode (LED) access points, and then modulates and reflects ambient RF carriers to indicate its location within particular VLC cells. We present a multi-cell VLC deployment with frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method that mitigates interference among LED access points by assigning them distinct frequency pairs based on a four-color map scheduling principle. We develop a lightweight particle filter (PF) tracking algorithm at an edge RF reader, where the fusion of proximity reports and the received backscatter signal strength are employed to track the BD. Experimental results show that this approach achieves the positioning error of 0.318 m at 50th percentile and 0.634 m at 90th percentile, while avoiding the use of complex photodetectors and active RF synthesizing components at the energy-neutral IoT node. By demonstrating robust performance in multiple indoor trajectories, the proposed solution enables scalable, cost-effective, and energy-neutral indoor tracking for pervasive and edge-assisted IoT applications.</description>
