      <title>Swampland Conjectures through ACT Observations: Observational Signatures of Radiative-Corrected Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency of radiatively corrected inflationary models with both the latest observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) combined with Planck 2018 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the theoretical constraints imposed by the swampland program. We systematically test two distinct models against three key swampland conjectures: the further refined de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRDSSC), the scalar weak gravity conjecture (SWGC), and the strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation, satisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational constraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, $r &lt; 0.038$), but fails to meet the SWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with quantum gravity principles. In contrast, Model II, incorporating radiative corrections with scalar sectors, demonstrates full consistency by satisfying all three swampland conjectures simultaneously while maintaining observational viability. The compatibility of Model II is highly sensitive to the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and renormalization scales $\mu_b$, with larger values extending the range of swampland-consistent solutions. Our results highlight the critical role of radiative corrections in achieving simultaneous theoretical and observational consistency, and identify Model II as a promising candidate for a fully viable inflationary scenario within the swampland framework. This work provides a methodology for classifying inflationary models based on their swampland compatibility, demonstrating that satisfaction of the FRDSSC alone is insufficient for full theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Background solutions to the Hubble tension in $f(Q)$ gravity and consistency with BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity are capable of solving the Hubble tension while producing consistency with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three different forms for the $f(Q)$ function: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We also consider extensions of these models by adding the Cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible double exponential addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI DR2 BAO, Planck 2018, Local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometers data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent models do not provide an adequate solution, while the exponential model gives a reasonable solution, though it faces mild tension with the BAO data. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better than the exponential, at the cost of reduced theoretical motivation. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while producing BAO consistency. The phenomenological models are able to achieve a good fit to all data, giving guidelines for what a background solution to the Hubble tension would look like in general.</description>

      <title>Forecasts of constraining isotropic cosmic birefringence on AliCPT-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence (CB) is a promising probe of parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model, characterized by the rotation of the linear polarization plane of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This effect, quantified by the birefringence angle $\beta$, generates non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ correlations that are otherwise absent in standard cosmology. However, instrumental miscalibration angles $\alpha$ can mimic this signal, necessitating a joint estimation approach. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of the AliCPT experiment, combined with Planck HFI data, on constraining the isotropic CB angle using a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood method. We simulate observations under various foreground complexities, rotation angles, and scanning strategies, and demonstrate that AliCPT can achieve an uncertainty of $\sigma(\beta)=0.09^\circ$ with one-year data, which will improve to $0.026^\circ$ after four years' observations. We also find that neglecting or mismodeling the foreground $EB$ correlation will introduce significant biases, which can be alleviated under a clean but small sky patch.</description>

      <title>Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. In this work, we present one of the first direct observational tests of luminosity-dependent assembly bias using a large sample of galaxy clusters with spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements, we find evidence for assembly bias: brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the $3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby confirming the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</description>

      <title>Synergy between CSST and third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: Inferring cosmological parameters using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) events are generally believed to originate in galaxies and can thus serve, like galaxies, as tracers of the universe's large-scale structure. In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and $4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on two-field quintessence with exponential potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Co-SIMP dark matter model using the 21-cm signal from dark ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the dark ages offers a powerful probe of cosmological models and the underlying dark matter microphysics. We investigate deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction, an absorption trough of approximately $-40.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at redshift $z \simeq 85.6$, in the context of co-SIMP dark matter. The strength of co-SIMP interactions, quantified by the parameter $C_{\rm int}$, enhances the absorption depth and shifts the trough to higher redshifts. For example, a model with $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ produces a minimum brightness temperature of $-50.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at $z \simeq 86.2$. The 21-cm power spectrum increases with $C_{\rm int}$ in addition to the global signal. We assess the detectability of these signatures using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher matrix forecasts. The maximum SNR reaches $\sim 15.7$ for $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ for the global signal. Fisher forecast for $1,000$ hours of integration time shows that this model can be distinguished from a null-signal at $4.3\sigma$ and from the $\Lambda$CDM model case at $1.6 \sigma$, with order-of-magnitude improvements for 100,000 hours of integration. For the 21-cm power spectrum, our forecasts reveal complementary trends; with a modest setup (collecting area of $5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ and 1,000 hours of integration time), the $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ model can be detected at $4.63\sigma$ and differentiated from the standard scenario at $1.78 \sigma$. These findings highlight the potential of the 21-cm cosmology to probe the properties of dark matter and demonstrate that upcoming dark ages experiments, particularly space-based and lunar observations, can offer a promising avenue to test co-SIMP models.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIX: SN 2025wny at $z=2$, the first strongly lensed superluminous supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of supernova SN 2025wny, associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821. Photometric monitoring from the Lulin and Maidanak observatories confirms multiple point-like images, consistent with SN 2025wny being strongly lensed by two foreground galaxies. Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time, the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the "perturber") to be z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN 2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for independent measurements of the Hubble constant. Following a tradition in the field of strongly-lensed SNe, we give SN 2025wny the nickname SN Winny.</description>

      <title>SENSEI: A Search for Diurnal Modulation in sub-GeV Dark Matter Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth's atmosphere and crust before reaching an underground detector. This Earth-shielding effect can induce a directional dependence in the dark matter flux, leading to a sidereal daily modulation in the signal rate. We perform a search for such a modulation using data from the SENSEI experiment, targeting MeV-scale dark matter. We achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity over previous direct-detection bounds for dark-matter masses below 1 MeV, assuming the Standard Halo Model with a Maxwell--Boltzmann velocity distribution, and constrain the amplitude of a general daily modulation signal to be below 6.8 electrons per gram per day.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Galaxy Assembly Bias using DESI DR1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of galaxy assembly bias, a critical systematic in cosmology, from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey. We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.</description>

      <title>Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive, low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z&gt;6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z&gt;6$ of $&lt;0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $&lt;0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z&gt;5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z&lt;10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z&gt;10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z&gt;16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z&gt;16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.</description>

WimPyC is an extension of the WimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct detection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial bodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant non-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an arbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic halo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the interaction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of the NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT are explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution is written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As in the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main components that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson coefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet completion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the nuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity distribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored separately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step of the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of the capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the sound shell model: direct and inverse phase transitions in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>A cosmological model with logarithmic f(T) gravity and H(z) quadratic expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel gravity model of type logarithmic type. This modified gravitational lagrangian yields a cosmological constant term and also power-law corrections to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) for small $\lambda$. By using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state parameter $\omega$. It turns out that, this modified gravitational theory produces solutions similar to the quintessence and phantom models.</description>

      <title>LEO Satellite Track Correction for CSST Multi-Band Imaging Data</title>

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters, including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction, including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats, and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions. Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands, and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.</description>

      <title>From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretations of the $k$-Nearest Neighbour Distributions</title>

Abstract: The $k$-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions are measures of clustering for discrete datasets that are fast and efficient to compute. They are significantly more informative than the 2-point correlation function. Their connection to $N$-point correlation functions, void probability functions and Counts-in-Cells is known. However, the connections between the CDFs and other geometric and topological spatial summary statistics are yet to be fully explored in the literature. This understanding will be crucial to find optimally informative summary statistics to analyse data from stage 4 cosmological surveys. We explore quantitatively the geometric interpretations of the $k$NN CDF summary statistics. We establish an equivalence between the 1NN CDF at radius $r$ and the volume of spheres with the same radius around the data points. We show that higher $k$NN CDFs are equivalent to the volumes of intersections of $\ge k$ spheres around the data points. We present similar geometric interpretations for the $k$NN cross-correlation joint CDFs. We further show that the volume, or the CDFs, have information about the angles and arc lengths created at the intersections of spheres around the data points, which can be accessed through the derivatives of the CDF. We show this information is very similar to that captured by Germ Grain Minkowski Functionals. Using a Fisher analysis we compare the information content and constraining power of various data vectors constructed from the $k$NN CDFs and Minkowski Functionals. We find that the CDFs and their derivatives and the Minkowski Functionals have nearly identical information content. However, $k$NN CDFs are computationally orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. Finally, we find that there is information in the full shape of the CDFs, and therefore caution against using the values of the CDF only at sparsely sampled radii.</description>

      <title>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}/D_{\text{A}}(z)(1+z)^{-2} = 1$, making it a powerful probe to check a potential variation of fundamental constants. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2.6$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations have motivated current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless, but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we sought to better understand the numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially, our aim was to better understand the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we ran SIDM N-body simulations of a low-mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation set-up was motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a SIDM kernel size that is too large can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our most highly resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we have made the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, for example that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows simulations to be run of halos that become concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1-like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Field-level constraints on cosmic birefringence from hybrid ILC maps combining $E$- and $B$-mode channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence, arising from a potential parity-violating interaction between cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and evolving pseudo-scalar fields such as axion-like particles, can rotate the CMB polarization plane and induce an effective correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we introduce a hybrid internal linear combination (ILC) method that combines both $E$- and $B$-mode frequency maps into the component separation pipeline, enabling the disentanglement of correlated and uncorrelated components of CMB polarization in the presence of cosmic birefringence and instrumental polarization angle miscalibration. We derive an analytic linear relation connecting the birefringence-induced correlated component of the CMB $E$- (or $B$-) mode field to the full CMB $B$- (or $E$-) mode field convolved with a modulating field. By performing linear regression between these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the birefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic birefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground contamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic birefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting spatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric, field-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence directly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the forthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are competitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses. When applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of $\beta = 0.32^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$, a $2.7\sigma$ detection that remains robust against varying sky fractions.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SBi3PCF:}$ Simulation-based inference with the integrated 3PCF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino mass and dark energy agnostic to the sound horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent BAO observations from DESI DR2 either hint at a possible dynamical dark energy component, which would worsen the Hubble tension, or at a 95\% credible interval for the summed neutrino mass hardly compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, using data mainly on uncalibrated distances, the growth of structures, and laboratory bounds on tritium $\beta$-decay, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=74.7^{+3.4}_{-4.4}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=131.1^{+6.8}_{-6.9}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu = 0.69^{+0.33}_{-0.47}$ eV (68\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model IV: Estimating the impact of positronium formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first assessment of how the previously unexplored effect of positronium formation can impact on the value of the effective number of neutrino species in the Standard Model, $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. Adopting a Yukawa form for the electrostatic potential, we discuss two possible scenarios that differ primarily in their assumptions about entropy evolution. The first, out-of-equilibrium scenario assumes that thermal corrections to the potential such as Debye screening prevent positronium from appearing until the temperature drops below a threshold. Once the threshold is reached, entropy generated in the QED sector from the equilibration process, if instantaneous, leads to a variation in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ of at most $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a larger change. The second, equilibrium scenario assumes the QED sector to stay in equilibrium at all times. In this case, we show that cancellations between the first, $s$-wave bound- and scattering-states contributions ensure that it is possible to evolve the system across the bound-state formation threshold without generating entropy in the QED sector. The corresponding change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ then closely matches the $\mathcal{O}(e^2)$ perturbative result derived in previous works and the $\mathcal{O}(e^4)$ contribution is capped at $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also comment on the impact of deviations from a pure Yukawa potential due to the presence of a thermal width.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). A probabilistic classification of quenched galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating what drives the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, and enable precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework that combines the average specific star-formation rate inferred over two timescales ($10^8,10^9$ yr) to categorise galaxies as `ageing' (secularly evolving), `quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `retired' (dominated by old stars). Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, which integrates posterior distributions, and a model-driven method, which optimises sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z&lt;0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72\%, 8-17\%, and 14-19\% for ageing, quenched, and retired populations, respectively. Ageing and retired galaxies dominate at the low- and high-mass end, respectively, while quenched galaxies surpass the retired fraction for $M_\ast \lesssim 10^{10}\,\rm M_\odot$. The evolution with redshift shows increasing and decreasing fractions of ageing and retired galaxies, respectively. More massive galaxies usually undergo quenching episodes at earlier times than to their low-mass counterparts. In terms of the mass-size-metallicity relation, ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while quenched galaxies form an intermediate population that is more compact and chemically evolved than ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and inflation from an infinite tower of regularized curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realized in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behavior and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realize oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study in a quantitative way two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behavior and also oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by solving numerically the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity which can naturally realize a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realize the phantom evolution.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur only in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $=822\pm101$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $=2814\pm327$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit on the gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 7\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$) with strong-line calibration established by JWST, making it the most metal-poor galaxy known at cosmic noon. Considering systematic uncertainties of $\gtrsim 0.3$ dex in the calibrations, the most conservative 2-$\sigma$ upper limit is set to 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.95. The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $13.9\pm2.5$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Legendre polynomials, previously employed in this context by Lee et al. [1], van Haasteren and Levin [2], and Pitrou and Cusin [3], to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.</description>
