      <title>A semi-automatic approach to study population dynamics based on population pyramids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depiction of populations - of humans or animals - as "population pyramids" is a useful tool for the assessment of various characteristics of populations at a glance. Although these visualisations are well-known objects in various communities, formalised and algorithmic approaches to gain information from these data are less present. Here, we present an algorithm-based classification of population data into "pyramids" of different shapes ([normal and inverted] pyramid / plunger / bell, [lower / middle / upper] diamond, column, hourglass) that are linked to specific characteristics of the population. To develop the algorithmic approach, we used data describing global zoo populations of mammals from 1970-2024. This algorithm-based approach delivers plausible classifications, in particular with respect to changes in population size linked to specific series of, and transitions between, different "pyramid" shapes. We believe this approach might become a useful tool for analysing and communicating historical population developments in multiple contexts and is of broad interest. Moreover, it might be useful for animal population management strategies.</description>

      <title>tskit_arg_visualizer: interactive plotting of ancestral recombination graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are a complete representation of the genetic relationships between recombining lineages and are of central importance in population genetics. Recent breakthroughs in simulation and inference methods have led to a surge of interest in ARGs. However, understanding how best to take advantage of the graphical structure of ARGs remains an open question for researchers. Here, we introduce tskit_arg_visualizer, a Python package for programmatically drawing ARGs using the interactive D3.js visualization library. We highlight the usefulness of this visualization tool for both teaching ARG concepts and exploring ARGs inferred from empirical datasets. Availability and implementation: The latest stable version of tskit_arg_visualizer is available through the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/tskit-arg-visualizer, currently v0.1.0). Documentation and the development version of the package are found on GitHub (https://github.com/kitchensjn/tskit_arg_visualizer). Supplementary materials: Methods for creating the example ARGs seen in Figure 1 can be found in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Generalising the Central Dogma as a cross-hierarchical principle of biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Dogma of molecular biology, as originally proposed by Crick, asserts that information passed into protein cannot flow back out. This principle has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of heredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from nucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central Dogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of information: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across generations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to facilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information. We argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a unifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of labour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular organisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a theoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution. Specifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma originates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary conflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma as an informational relationship between components of a system, this generalisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological hierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin.</description>

      <title>Estimating breast cancer recurrence in a population-based registry in Georgia, US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the descriptive epidemiology of primary breast cancer is well characterized in the US, breast cancer recurrence rates have not been measured in an unselected population. The number of breast cancer survivors at risk for recurrence is growing each year, so recurrence surveillance is a pressing need. We used missing data methods to impute breast cancer recurrence and estimate the risk of recurrence in the Cancer Recurrence Information and Surveillance Program (CRISP) cohort in the Georgia Cancer Registry. The imputation model was based on an internal validation substudy and indicators recorded in the registry (e.g., pathology reports, imaging claims), prognostic variables (e.g., stage at diagnosis), and characteristics associated with missing data (e.g., insurance coverage). We pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) across 1000 imputed datasets, adjusted for age, stage, grade, subtype, race and ethnicity, marital status, and urban/rural county at diagnosis. There were 1,606 patients with a validated outcome (75% with breast cancer recurrence) and we imputed the outcome for the remaining 23,439 patients. We estimated an overall 7.2% incidence of recurrence between at least 1 year after diagnosis and up to 5 years of follow up. When comparing the hazards pooled across imputations, we found that some patterns differed from established patterns in mortality or survival, notably by race and ethnicity, underscoring the need for continued research on the descriptive epidemiology of breast cancer recurrence. These results provide new insights into surveillance for breast cancer survivors in Georgia, especially those with higher stage and grade tumors, of Hispanic ethnicity, and who may be lacking social support.</description>

      <title>The signal is not flushed away: Inferring the effective reproduction number from wastewater data in small populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective reproduction number is an important descriptor of an infectious disease epidemic. In small populations, ideally we would estimate the effective reproduction number using a Markov Jump Process (MJP) model of the spread of infectious disease, but in practice this is computationally challenging. We propose a computationally tractable approximation to an MJP which tracks only latent and infectious individuals, the EI model, an MJP where the time-varying immigration rate into the E compartment is equal to the product of the proportion of susceptibles in the population and the transmission rate. We use an analogue of the central limit theorem for MJPs to approximate transition densities as normal, which makes Bayesian computation tractable. Using simulated pathogen RNA concentrations collected from wastewater data, we demonstrate the advantages of our stochastic model over its deterministic counterpart for the purpose of estimating effective reproduction number dynamics, and compare against a state of the art method. We apply our new model to inference of changes in the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in several college campus communities that were put under wastewater pathogen surveillance in 2022.</description>

      <title>Tweets vs Pathogen Spread: A Case Study of COVID-19 in American States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the mutual influence that awareness and disease may exert on each other has recently presented significant challenges. The actions individuals take to prevent contracting a disease and their level of awareness can profoundly affect the dynamics of its spread. Simultaneously, disease outbreaks impact how people become aware. In response, we initially propose a null model that couples two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) dynamics and analyze it using a mean-field approach. Subsequently, we explore the parameter space to quantify the effects of this mutual influence on various observables. Finally, based on this null model, we conduct an empirical analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 and confirmed cases within American states. Our findings indicate that in specific regions of the parameter space, it is possible to suppress the epidemic by increasing awareness, and we investigate phase transitions. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the ability to alter the dominant population group by adjusting parameters throughout the course of the outbreak. Additionally, using the model, we assign a set of parameters to each state, revealing that these parameters change at different pandemic peaks. Notably, a robust correlation emerges between the ranking of states' Twitter activity, as gathered from empirical data, and the immunity parameters assigned to each state using our model. This observation underscores the pivotal role of sustained awareness transitioning from the initial to the subsequent peaks in the disease progression.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ecosystems frequently display the coexistence of diverse species under resource competition, typically resulting in skewed distributions of rarity and abundance. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. How to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this work, we study correlated temporal fluctuations in species' resource uptake rates -- i.e. metabolic strategies -- within a stochastic consumer-resource framework. In a biologically relevant regime, we are able to find analytically the species abundance distributions through the path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations. Within this framework, ecological communities show a higher diversity than expected under static competitive scenarios. We find that all species become extinct when the ratio of the number of species to the number of resources exceeds a critical threshold. Conversely, diversity peaks at intermediate values of the same ratio. Furthermore, when metabolic strategies of different species are different on average, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community structure.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fermat-Weber Points over Spaces of $M$-Ultrametrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend reconstruction methods for phylogenetic trees to ultrametrics of arbitrary matroids and study the stability of these data analysis methods in the combinatorial spirit of Andreas Dress. In particular, we generalize Atteson's work on the safety radius of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, as well as Gascuel and Steel's work on the stochastic safety radius, to arbitrary matroids. We also show that although the tropical Fermat-Weber points of an $M$-ultrametric sample are generally not contained in the space of $M$-ultrametrics, the intersection between the Fermat-Weber set and the space of $M$-ultrametrics is always non-empty.</description>

      <title>The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} = \mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$ drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, in proportion to the slope of performance with respect to the parameters. The metric $\mathbf{M}$ rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics, Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.</description>
