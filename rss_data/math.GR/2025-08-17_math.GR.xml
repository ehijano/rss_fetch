      <title>Orthogonal pairs of Euler elements I. Classification, fundamental groups and twisted duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current article continues our project
  on representation theory, Euler elements, causal homogeneous spaces and
  Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT).
  We call a pair (h,k) of Euler elements
  orthogonal if $e^{\pi i \ad h} k = -k$.
  We show that, if (h,k) and (k,h) are orthogonal, then
  they generate a 3-dimensional simple subalgebra.
  We also classify orthogonal Euler pairs in simple Lie algebras
  and determine the fundamental groups of adjoint Euler elements
  in arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
  Causal complements of wedge regions in spacetimes
  can be related to so-called
  twisted complements in the space
  of abstract Euler wedges, defined in purely group theoretic terms.
  We show that any pair of twisted complements can be connected
  by a chain of successive complements coming from $3$-dimensional subalgebras.</description>

      <title>The arc complex is not quasi-isometric to the sphere complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the arc complex $\mathcal{A}(S_{g,1})$ is not quasi-isometric to the sphere complex $\mathcal S_{2g}$ associated to the double of a genus $2g$ handlebody. Along the way, we present a simple proof that $\mathcal{A}(S_{g,1})$ is quasi-isometrically rigid.</description>

      <title>Random quotients of mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several rigidity properties for random quotients of mapping class groups of surfaces, namely whose kernel is normally generated by the n-th steps of finitely many independent random walks. Firstly, we generalise a celebrated theorem of Ivanov's: every automorphism of the corresponding quotient of the curve graph is induced by a mapping class. Next, we show that, if a finitely generated group is quasi-isometric to a random quotient, then the two groups are weakly commensurable. This uses techniques from the world of hierarchically hyperbolic groups: indeed, in the process we clarify a proof of Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto on the quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups, which might possibly be applied to other hierarchically hyperbolic groups. Finally, we show that the automorphisms groups of our quotients, as well as their abstract commensurators, coincide with the groups themselves. Our results hold for a wider family of quotients, namely those whose kernel act by sufficiently large translations on the curve graph. This class also includes quotients by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov element.</description>

      <title>Mixed identities for oligomorphic automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixed identities for oligomorphic automorphism groups of countable relational structures. Our main result gives sufficient conditions for such a group to not admit a mixed identity without particular constants. We study numerous examples and prove in many cases that there cannot be a non-singular mixed identity.</description>

      <title>Triangle Presentations Encoded by Perfect Difference Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When James Singer exhibited projective planes for all prime power orders in 1938, he realized these using the trace function of cubic extensions of a finite field and linked $\text{trace}=0$ to perfect difference sets. In 1993, Cartwright, Mantero, Steger, and Zappa found that this trace function can be used to create a triangle presentation, which determines the structure of an $\tilde{A}_2$ building. We demonstrate a new, intrinsic connection between the perfect different sets of Singer and the triangle presentations of Cartwright et al., and show that this connection improves the efficiency of algorithms that generate these triangle presentations. Moreover, we translate the panel-regular groups of Essert \cite{essert2013geometric} and Witzel \cite{witzel2017panel} using triangle presentation nomenclature. This translation creates a uniform understanding of the panel-regular groups and vertex-regular groups via triangle presentations.</description>

      <title>Groups with conjugacy classes of coprime sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $x$, $y$ are elements of a finite group $G$ lying in conjugacy classes of coprime sizes. We prove that $\langle x^G \rangle \cap \langle y^G \rangle$ is an abelian normal subgroup of $G$ and, as a consequence, that if $x$ and $y$ are $\pi$-regular elements for some set of primes $\pi$, then $x^G y^G$ is a $\pi$-regular conjugacy class in $G$. The latter statement was previously known for $\pi$-separable groups $G$ and this generalisation permits us to extend several results concerning the common divisor graph on $p$-regular conjugacy classes, for some prime $p$.</description>

      <title>The H\"older exponent of Anosov limit maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary word hyperbolic group and $d_{a}, a&gt;1,$ a visual metric on its Gromov boundary $\partial_{\infty}\Gamma$. For an $1$-Anosov representation $\rho:\Gamma \rightarrow \mathsf{GL}_{d}(\mathbb{K})$, where $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, we calculate the H\"older exponent of the Anosov limit map $\xi_{\rho}^1:(\partial_{\infty}\Gamma, d_{a})\rightarrow (\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K}^d),d_{\mathbb{P}})$ of $\rho$ in terms of the moduli of eigenvalues of elements in $\rho(\Gamma)$ and the stable translation length on $\Gamma$. If $\rho$ is either irreducible or $\xi_{\rho}^1(\partial_{\infty}\Gamma)$ spans $\mathbb{K}^d$ and $\rho$ is $\{1,2\}$-Anosov, then $\xi_{\rho}^1$ attains its H\"older exponent. We also provide an analogous calculation for the exponent of the inverse limit map of $(1,1,2)$-hyperconvex representations. Finally, we exhibit examples of non semisimple $1$-Anosov representations of surface groups in $\mathsf{SL}_4(\mathbb{R})$ whose Anosov limit map in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^4)$ does not attain its H\"older exponent.</description>

      <title>Loops, Holonomy and Signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>

      <title>On Root Capacity, Intersection Indicium, Minimal Generating Sets of Galois Closure &amp; Compositum Feasible Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [2] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article and also apply similar methods to resolve certain problems in related areas. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [2]. We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>
