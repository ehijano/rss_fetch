      <title>Stochastic Earned Duration Analysis for Project Schedule Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earned duration management (EDM) is a methodology for project schedule management (PSM) that can be considered an alternative to earned value management (EVM). EDM provides an estimation of deviations in schedule and a final project duration estimation. There is a key difference between EDM and EVM: In EDM, the value of activities is expressed as work periods; whereas in EVM, value is expressed in terms of cost. In this paper, we present how EDM can be applied to monitor and control stochastic projects. To explain the methodology, we use a real case study with a project that presents a high level of uncertainty and activities with random durations. We analyze the usability of this approach according to the activities network topology and compare the EVM and earned schedule methodology (ESM) for PSM.</description>

      <title>Building and development of an organizational competence for digital transformation in SMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The new competitive environment characterized by innovation and constant change is forcing a new organizational behavior. This requires a digital transformation of SMEs based on collective performance determinants. SMEs have particular characteristics that differentiate them from large companies and a model that allows them to identify, leverage and develop their digital capabilities can help them to advance in digital maturity.
  Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth review of the existing literature on digital transformation and organizational competence was carried out on Scopus and Web of Science to identify the digital challenges faced by SMEs, and what digital capabilities they have to develop to face these challenges. In order to obtain the necessary information for the refinement of organizational competence for digital transformation model, six experts were interviewed; three of them are academics and the other three are professionals with management responsibilities in SMEs. We used semi-structured interviews, to keep the interviews focused and facilitate cross-data analysis between experts. In addition, it allowed us the possibility of analyzing new relevant aspects that could arise during the interview.
  Findings: As a result of this study we have developed a refined model of organizational competence for digital transformation that allows SMEs to identify and develop the digital capabilities necessary to advance in the digital transformation, refined with the opinions of six experts consulted. We were able to observe the importance of organizational learning and organizational knowledge to advance the digital transformation of SMEs.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Business Intelligence Maturity Models to SMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large companies are fully engaged in their digital transformation, specifically in developing strategic Business Intelligence (BI) projects. They have a Digital Strategy and top-level executives managing the change. BI projects are also being carried out in SMEs. In this paper, we present the results of an interpretative study conducted on a sample of SMEs from different sectors carrying out BI projects. We study whether BI maturity models are valid for SMEs and their usefulness for analysing the projects and evaluating the results at the end of the project.</description>

      <title>Stakeholder-driven research in the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast-paced policy context is characteristic of energy and climate research, which strives to develop solutions to wicked problems such as climate change. Funding agencies in the European Union recognize the importance of linking research and policy in climate and energy research. This calls for an increased understanding of how stakeholder engagement can effectively be used to co-design research questions that include stakeholders' concerns. This paper reviews the current literature on stakeholder engagement, from which we create a set of criteria. These are used to critically assess recent and relevant papers on stakeholder engagement in climate and energy projects. We obtained the papers from a scoping review of stakeholder engagement through workshops in EU climate and energy research. With insights from the literature and current EU climate and energy projects, we developed a workshop programme for stakeholder engagement. This programme was applied to the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum project, aiming to co-design the most pressing and urgent research questions according to European stakeholders. The outcomes include 82 co-designed and ranked research questions for nine specific climate and energy research themes. Findings from the scoping review indicate that papers rarely define the term 'stakeholder'. Additionally, the concepts of co-creation, co-design, and co-production are used interchangeably and often without definition. We propose that workshop planners use stakeholder identification and selection methods from the broader stakeholder engagement literature.</description>

      <title>On Labs and Fabs: Mapping How Alliances, Acquisitions, and Antitrust are Shaping the Frontier AI Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As frontier AI models progress, policy proposals for safe AI development are gaining increasing attention from researchers and policymakers. This paper evaluates the present landscape of integration within the AI supply chain, emphasizing vertical relations and strategic partnerships, with the goal of laying the groundwork to further understand the implications of various governance interventions, including antitrust. The study has two main contributions. First, it maps the AI supply chain by profiling 25 leading companies, examining their 300 pairwise relationships, and noting approximately 80 significant mergers and acquisitions, and 40 relevant antitrust litigation. Second, it offers a conceptual discussion on market definitions and integration drivers, investigating major players like AI labs and chip designers, horizontal integration levels, and vertical relationships among industry leaders. To further understand the strategic partnerships in the industry, we provide three brief case studies, featuring companies such as OpenAI and Nvidia. We conclude by posing open research questions regarding market dynamics and potential governance interventions, such as licensing and safety audits.</description>

      <title>How Inductive Bias in Machine Learning Aligns with Optimality in Economic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Sustainability in Controlling and Accounting Practices: A Critical Review and Implications for Competences in German Vocational Business Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability in accounting and controlling has traditionally been understood in terms of securing the long-term existence of companies. However, with the introduction of integrated non-financial reporting, sustainability, as per the triple bottom line model, is increasingly being discussed as a component of accounting and controlling. Yet, integration primarily occurs in separate sustainability management and controlling departments. Moreover, the implementation of sustainability efforts requires suitably qualified employees, who drive the transition. The academic discourse surrounding sustainability in businesses in general, and in accounting and controlling specifically, is complex. It remains unclear to what extent sustainability has been integrated into accounting and controlling, and what competencies employees need to manage this transformation. These questions will be critically analyzed in this structured literature review of 79 publications. The results provide insights into a) how companies conceptualize sustainability, b) whether and how they integrate it into their value creation processes, and c) the relevance of accounting and controlling for these developments. To contextualize the role of employees, the competency requirements within companies will be analyzed to enable employees in accounting and controlling to engage effectively in sustainability-oriented activities. Specifically, implications for changes in curricula with a focus on accounting and controlling are derived.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion in Dynamic Pricing with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, a significant share of the Business-to-Consumer sector is based on online platforms like Amazon and Alibaba and uses Artificial Intelligence for pricing strategies. This has sparked debate on whether pricing algorithms may tacitly collude to set supra-competitive prices without being explicitly designed to do so. Our study addresses these concerns by examining the risk of collusion when Reinforcement Learning algorithms are used to decide on pricing strategies in competitive markets. Prior research in this field focused on Tabular Q-learning (TQL) and led to opposing views on whether learning-based algorithms can lead to supra-competitive prices. Our work contributes to this ongoing discussion by providing a more nuanced numerical study that goes beyond TQL by additionally capturing off- and on-policy Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. We study multiple Bertrand oligopoly variants and show that algorithmic collusion depends on the algorithm used. In our experiments, TQL exhibits higher collusion and price dispersion phenomena compared to DRL algorithms. We show that the severity of collusion depends not only on the algorithm used but also on the characteristics of the market environment. We further find that Proximal Policy Optimization appears to be less sensitive to collusive outcomes compared to other state-of-the-art DRL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Do Cure Violence Programs Reduce Gun Violence? Evidence from New York City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cure Violence is a community violence intervention program that aims to reduce gun violence by mediating conflicts, "treating" high-risk individuals, and changing community norms. Using NYC shootings data from 2006-2023, we assess the efficacy of Cure Violence using both difference-in-differences and event study models. We find that, on average, Cure Violence is associated with a 14% reduction in shootings relative to the counterfactual. This association persists in the years after treatment, neither increasing nor decreasing much over time. We exploit variation in the geography and timing of Cure implementation to argue against alternative explanations. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence of spillover effects into nearby precincts, as well as increasing returns to opening new Cure programs. Interpreted causally, our results imply that around 1,300 shootings were avoided between 2012-2023 due to Cure -- generating a net social surplus of $2.45 billion and achieving a benefit-cost ratio of 6.5:1.</description>

      <title>Distrust of social media influencers in America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of social media influencers (SMI) as a means for businesses and causes to engage with the public and develop followers is undeniable. However, the use of SMI have been scrutinized due to various scandals that reflect poorly on brands and firms. Consequently, the distrust of SMI can create the potential for damage to a brand if audiences are not receptive to communications and messaging. This study (n=351) shares insights and findings of the apparent distrust of SMI that were discovered during the data analysis phase of my dissertation (Berry, 2024a). The study examines levels of trust and distrust toward SMI in the United States according to various demographic characteristics of respondents, specifically, age, gender, income level, education level, and region of the United States. Chi square analysis of the variables and a predictive model of trust of SMI are presented. Finally, recommendations and suggestions for future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Oxford Olympics Study 2024: Are Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games Coming Down?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is an update of the "Oxford Olympics Study 2016" (Flyvbjerg et al. 2016). We document that the Games remain costly and continue to have large cost overruns, to a degree that threatens their viability. The IOC is aware of the problem and has initiated reform. We assess the reforms and find: (a) Olympic costs are statistically significantly increasing; prior analysis did not show this trend; it is a step in the wrong direction. (b) Cost overruns were decreasing until 2008, but have increased since then; again a step in the wrong direction. (c) At present, the cost of Paris 2024 is USD 8.7 billion (2022 level) and cost overruns is 115% in real terms; this is not the cheap Games that were promised. (d) Cost overruns are the norm for the Games, past, present, and future; they are the only project type that never delivered on budget. We assess a new IOC policy of reducing cost by reusing existing venues instead of building new ones. We find that reuse did not have the desired effect for Tokyo 2020 and also look ineffective for Paris 2024. Finally, we recommend that the Games look to other types of megaprojects for better data, better forecasting, and how to generate the positive learning curves that are necessary for bringing costs and overrun down. Only if this happens are Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032 likely to live up to the IOC's intentions of a more affordable Games that more cities will want to host.</description>

      <title>$u^* = \sqrt{uv}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to compute the unemployment rate $u^*$ that is consistent with full employment in the United States. First, it argues that the most appropriate economic translation of the legal notion of full employment is labor-market efficiency. Here efficiency requires to minimize the nonproductive use of labor -- both unemployment and recruiting. The nonproductive use of labor is measured by the number of jobseekers and vacancies, $u + v$. Through the Beveridge curve, the numbers of vacancies and jobseekers are inversely related, $uv = \text{constant}$. With such symmetry the labor market is efficient -- at full employment -- when there are as many jobseekers as vacancies ($u = v$), inefficiently tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers ($v &gt; u$), and inefficiently slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies ($u &gt; v$). Accordingly, the full-employment rate of unemployment (FERU) is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates: $u^* = \sqrt{uv}$. Between 1930 and 2023, the labor market has generally been inefficiently slack, especially during recessions; the labor market has only been inefficiently tight during major wars and around the coronavirus pandemic. Over that period, the FERU averages $4.1\%$ and is quite stable.</description>

      <title>Informed Neutrality in Minimalist Market Design: A Case Study on a Constitutional Crisis in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 3-2 split verdict, the Supreme Court approved the exclusion of India's socially and economically backward classes from its affirmative action measures to address economic deprivation. Dissenting justices, including the Chief Justice of India, protested the Majority Opinion for sanctioning "an avowedly exclusionary and discriminatory principle." To justify their controversial decision, the majority justices relied on technical arguments that are categorically false. The confusion of the justices is due to a subtle technical aspect of the affirmative action system in India: the significance of overlaps between members of protected groups. Conventionally, protected classes were determined by the caste system, which meant they did not overlap. The addition of a new protected class defined by economic criteria alters this structure, unless it is artificially enforced. The majority justices failed to appreciate the significance of this critical change and inaccurately argued that the controversial exclusion is a technical necessity to provide benefits to previously unprotected members of a new class. We show that this case could have been resolved with three competing policies that each avoid the controversial exclusion. One of these policies aligns with the core arguments in the Majority Opinion, whereas a second aligns with those in the Dissenting Opinion.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Dunkelflaute: How (not) to analyze variable renewable energy shortage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As variable renewable energy sources increasingly gain importance in global energy systems, there is a growing interest in understanding periods of variable renewable energy shortage ("Dunkelflauten"). Defining, quantifying, and comparing such shortage events across different renewable generation technologies and locations presents a surprisingly intricate challenge. Various methodological approaches exist in different bodies of literature, which have been applied to single technologies in specific locations or technology portfolios across multiple regions. We provide an overview of various methods for quantifying variable renewable energy shortage, focusing either on supply from variable renewables or its mismatch with electricity demand. We explain and critically discuss the merits and challenges of different approaches for defining and identifying shortage events and propose further methodological improvements for more accurate shortage determination. Additionally, we elaborate on comparability requirements for multi-technological and multi-regional energy shortage analysis. In doing so, we aim to contribute to unifying disparate methodologies, harmonizing terminologies, and providing guidance for future research.</description>

      <title>Investigating Assumptions and Proposals for Blockchain Integration in the Circular Economy. A Delphi Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the rising interest in the circular economy and blockchain hype, numerous integrations were proposed. However, studies on the practical feasibility were scarce, and the assumptions of blockchain potential in the circular economy were rarely questioned. With the help of eleven of the most prominent blockchain experts, the present study critically analyzed technology integration in many areas of the circular economy to forecast their possible outcomes. Delphi's technique is leveraged to reach a consensus among experts' visions and opinions. Results support the view that some circular economy integrations are unlikely to succeed, while others if specific conditions are met, may prove to be successful in the long run.</description>
