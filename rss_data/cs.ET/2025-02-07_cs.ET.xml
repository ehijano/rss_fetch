      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS: A New Frontier for 6G Internet of Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering a paradigm shift from passive environments to programmable radio wave propagation. Despite the potential of diagonal RIS (D-RIS), its limited wave manipulation capability restricts performance gains. In this paper, we investigate the burgeoning concept of beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), which incorporates non-diagonal elements in its scattering matrix to deliver more fine-grained control of electromagnetic wavefronts. We begin by discussing the limitations of traditional D-RIS and introduce key BD-RIS architectures with different operating modes. We then highlight the features that make BD-RIS particularly advantageous for 6G IoT applications, including advanced beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and flexible coverage. A case study on BD-RIS-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in an underlay cellular network demonstrates considerable improvements in spectral efficiency when compared to D-RIS and conventional systems. Lastly, we present current challenges such as hardware design complexity, channel estimation, and non-ideal hardware effects, and propose future research directions involving AI-driven optimization, joint communication and sensing, and physical layer security. Our findings illustrate the transformative potential of BD-RIS in shaping high-performance, scalable, and reliable 6G IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Design using a Progressive Widening Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03962</link>

Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem and to the quantum hardware. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. It introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits have up to three times fewer CNOT gates.</description>

      <title>Non-Variational Quantum Random Access Optimization with Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application domains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry and the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the ability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization problems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error correction. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to reduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO has only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the need to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult to scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show that instance-independent ``fixed'' parameters achieve good performance, removing the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we evaluate different design choices, such as various mixers and initial states, as well as QAOA operator implementations when customizing for QRAO, and identify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Experiments with an oscillator based Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in non-algorithmic, unconventional computing is rising in recent years due to more and more apparent short comings of classic stored-program digital computers, such as energy efficiency, degree of parallelism in computations, clock frequency limitations, integration density, silicon utilization, etc. One notable such unconventional approach are oscillator based Ising machines, i.e., systems consisting of a number of oscillators which can be coupled in order to create an analogue for some problem to be solved, while the actual information is encoded in the phase relationships of these oscillators with respect to some reference (typically one of these oscillators). It has been shown that machines of this type are capable of solving NP-hard problems such as max-cut, etc. In the following an experimental Ising machine is presented together with experimental results obtained from this machine.</description>
