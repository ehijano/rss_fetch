      <title>PINN-MG: A Multigrid-Inspired Hybrid Framework Combining Iterative Method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative methods are widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the difficulty in eliminating global low-frequency errors significantly limits their convergence speed. In recent years, neural networks have emerged as a novel approach for solving PDEs, with studies revealing that they exhibit faster convergence for low-frequency components. Building on this complementary frequency convergence characteristics of iterative methods and neural networks, we draw inspiration from multigrid methods and propose a hybrid solving framework that combining iterative methods and neural network-based solvers, termed PINN-MG (PMG). In this framework, the iterative method is responsible for eliminating local high-frequency oscillation errors, while Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are employed to correct global low-frequency errors. Throughout the solving process, high- and low-frequency components alternately dominate the error, with each being addressed by the iterative method and PINNs respectively, thereby accelerating the convergence. We tested the proposed PMG framework on the linear Poisson equation and the nonlinear Helmholtz equation, and the results demonstrated significant acceleration of the PMG when built on Gauss-Seidel, pseudo-time, and GMRES methods. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the convergence process further validates the rationality of the framework. We proposed that the PMG framework is a hybrid solving approach that does not rely on training data, achieving an organic integration of neural network methods with iterative methods.</description>

      <title>dCG -- differentiable connected geometries for multi-domain optimization and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of geometry and topology optimization, discovering geometries that optimally satisfy specific problem criteria is a complex challenge in both engineering and scientific research. In this work, we propose a new approach for the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work with automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable Connected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating its application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic optimization task. Since these geometries are built upon the principles of automatic differentiation, they are compatible with existing deep learning frameworks, a feature we demonstrate via the application examples. This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous estimation of electrical conductivity and permittivity in quantitative thermoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the inverse problem of quantitative thermoacoustic tomography is studied. In quantitative thermoacoustic tomography, dielectric parameters of an imaged target are estimated from an absorbed energy density induced by an externally introduced electromagnetic excitation. In this work, simultaneous estimation of electrical conductivity and permittivity is considered. We approach this problem in the framework of Bayesian inverse problems. The dielectric parameters are estimated by computing maximum a posteriori estimates, and the reliability of the estimates is studied using the Laplace's approximation. The forward model to describe electromagnetic wave propagation is based on a vectorial Maxwell's equation, that is numerically approximated using a finite element method with edge elements. The proposed methodology is evaluated using numerical simulations utilising one or two electromagnetic excitations at multiple excitation frequencies. The results show that the electrical conductivity and permittivity can be simultaneously estimated in quantitative thermoacoustic tomography. However, the problem can suffer from non-uniqueness, which could be overcome using multiple electromagnetic excitations.</description>

      <title>Micrometer: Micromechanics Transformer for Predicting Mechanical Responses of Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous materials, crucial in various engineering applications, exhibit complex multiscale behavior, which challenges the effectiveness of traditional computational methods. In this work, we introduce the Micromechanics Transformer ({\em Micrometer}), an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials, bridging the gap between advanced data-driven methods and complex solid mechanics problems. Trained on a large-scale high-resolution dataset of 2D fiber-reinforced composites, Micrometer can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting microscale strain fields across a wide range of microstructures, material properties under any loading conditions and We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of Micrometer through applications in computational homogenization and multiscale modeling, where Micrometer achieves 1\% error in predicting macroscale stress fields while reducing computational time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to conventional numerical solvers. We further showcase the adaptability of the proposed model through transfer learning experiments on new materials with limited data, highlighting its potential to tackle diverse scenarios in mechanical analysis of solid materials. Our work represents a significant step towards AI-driven innovation in computational solid mechanics, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical methods and paving the way for more efficient simulations of heterogeneous materials across various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature decomposition of the ethaline deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmentally-benign, non-toxic electrolytes with combinatorial design spaces are excellent candidates for green solvents, green leaching agents, and carbon capture sources. Here, we examine one particular green solvent, ethaline, a 2:1 molar ratio of ethylene glycol and choline chloride. Despite its touted green credentials, we find partial decomposition of ethaline into toxic chloromethane and dimethylaminoethanol at room temperature, limiting its sustainable advantage. We experimentally characterize these decomposition products and computationally develop a general, quantum chemically-accurate workflow to understand decomposition. We find that fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds bind chloride near reaction sites, initiating the reaction between choline cations and chloride anions. In summary, in the design of green solvents, we do not recommend the use of choline chloride due to its susceptibility to undergo decomposition in strongly hydrogen-bound mixtures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Inversion from Scattering for Mechanically Driven Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Machine Learning Inversion method for analyzing scattering functions of mechanically driven polymers and extracting the corresponding feature parameters, which include energy parameters and conformation variables. The polymer is modeled as a chain of fixed-length bonds constrained by bending energy, and it is subject to external forces such as stretching and shear. We generate a data set consisting of random combinations of energy parameters, including bending modulus, stretching, and shear force, along with Monte Carlo-calculated scattering functions and conformation variables such as end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, and the off-diagonal component of the gyration tensor. The effects of the energy parameters on the polymer are captured by the scattering function, and principal component analysis ensures the feasibility of the Machine Learning inversion. Finally, we train a Gaussian Process Regressor using part of the data set as a training set and validate the trained regressor for inversion using the rest of the data. The regressor successfully extracts the feature parameters.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanisms of Diffusion Dynamics: A Comparative Efficiency Study of Event-Chain Monte Carlo Variants in Dense Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, efficient methods for investigating equilibration and slow relaxation in dense systems are crucial yet challenging. This study focuses on the diffusional characteristics of monodisperse hard disk systems at equilibrium, comparing novel methodologies of event-chain Monte Carlo variants, specifically the Newtonian event-chain and straight event-chain algorithms. We systematically analyze both event-based and CPU time-based efficiency in liquid and solid phases, aiming to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms underlying structural relaxation. Our results demonstrate how chain length or duration, system size, and phase state influence the efficiency of diffusion dynamics, including hopping motion. This work provides insights into optimizing simulation techniques for highly packed systems and has the potential to improve our understanding of diffusion dynamics even in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Highly Deformable van der Waals Layered Chalcogenides with Superior Thermoelectric Performance Using Deformability Factors and Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals layered chalcogenide-based flexible thermoelectric devices show great potential for applications in wearable electronics. However, materials that are both highly deformable and exhibit superior thermoelectric performance are extremely limited. There is an urgent need for methods that can efficiently predict both deformability and thermoelectric performance to enable high-throughput screening of these materials. In this study, over 1000 van der Waals layered chalcogenides were high-throughput screened from material databases, the deformability of which were predicted with our previously developed deformability factor. An accurate and efficient model based on machine learning methods were developed to predict the thermoelectric properties. Several candidate materials with both deformability and thermoelectric potential were successfully discovered. Among them, NbSe2Br2 was verified by first principles calculations, achieving ZTmax value of 1.35 at 1000K, which is currently the highest value among flexible inorganic thermoelectric materials. And the power factor value of 8.1 {\mu}Wcm-1K-2 at 300K also surpassed most organic and inorganic flexible thermoelectric materials. Its high deformability mainly attributed to the small slipping energy that allows interlayer slip and the small in-plane modulus that allows deformation before failure. The high ZTmax is mainly contributed by the extremely low thermal conductivity and the high Seebeck coefficient along the out-of-plane direction at high temperature. The high power factor at room temperature is mainly comes from the high conductivity in the in-plane direction. This study is expected to accelerate the development and application of flexible thermoelectric devices based on inorganic semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow in 3-dimensional porous systems shows power law scaling with Minkowski functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral geometry uses four geometric invariants -- the Minkowski functionals -- to characterize certain subsets of 3-dimensional space. The question was, how is the fluid flow in a 3-dimensional porous system related to these invariants? In this work, we systematically study the dependency of permeability on the geometrical characteristics of two categories of 3-dimensional porous systems generated: (i) stochastic and (ii) deterministic. For the stochastic systems, we investigated both normal and log-normal size distribution of grains. For the deterministic porous systems, we checked for a cubic and a hexagonal arrangement of grains of equal size. Our studies reveal that for any 3-dimensional porous system, ordered or disordered, permeability $k$ follows a unique scaling relation with the Minkowski functionals: (a) volume of the pore space, (b) integral mean curvature, (c) Euler Characteristic and (d) critical cross-sectional area of the pore space. The cubic and the hexagonal symmetrical systems formed the upper and lower bounds of the scaling relations, respectively. The disordered systems lay between these bounds. Moreover, we propose a combinatoric $F$ that weaves together the four Minkowski functionals and follows a power-law scaling with permeability. The scaling exponent is independent of particle size and distribution and has a universal value of $ 0.428$ for 3-dimensional porous systems built of spherical grains.</description>

      <title>Node-reconfiguring multilayer networks of human brain function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers.The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.</description>

      <title>Divergence cleaning for weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a divergence cleaning formulation for the velocity in the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme. The proposed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning, ensures that the velocity divergence, $div(\mathbf{u})$, is minimised throughout the simulation. The divergence equation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation through a scalar field $\psi$. A parabolic term is added to the time-evolving divergence equation, resulting in a hyperbolic/parabolic form, dissipating acoustic waves with a speed of sound proportional to the local Mach number in order to maximise dissipation of the velocity divergence, preventing unwanted diffusion of the pressure field. The $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH algorithm is implemented in the open-source weakly compressible SPH solver DualSPHysics. The new formulation is validated against a range of challenging 2-D test cases including the Taylor-Green vortices, patch impact test, jet impinging on a surface, and wave impact in a sloshing tank. The results show that the new formulation reduces the divergence in the velocity field by at least one order of magnitude which prevents spurious numerical noise and the formation of unphysical voids. The temporal evolution of the impact pressures shows that the $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH formulation virtually eliminates unwanted acoustic pressure oscillations. Investigation of particle resolution confirms that the new $div(\mathbf{u})$-SPH formulation does not reduce the spatial convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Control of Cu morphology on TaN barrier and combined Ru-TaN barrier/liner substrates for nanoscale interconnects from atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices brings severe challenges in the deposition of metal interconnects in back end of line processing due to a continually decreasing volume available for metal deposition in the interconnect via. Cu is currently used as the interconnect metal and requires barrier and liner layers to prevent diffusion into silicon and promote deposition of smooth conducting metal films, respectively. However, these take up a significant volume in the interconnect vias, which are already extremely narrow due to the high aspect ratio required. Designing combined barrier/liner materials provides opportunities to promote deposition of smooth films and avoid islanding and frees up precious volume to deposit the required amount of interconnect metal. We present here the first atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) investigation of the potential of Ru-modified TaN as a dual-function barrier/line material to promote 2D morphology of deposited Cu enabling optimization of the limited available interconnect volume. The kMC simulations use Density Functional Theory (DFT) activation barriers to predict the role of the combined barrier/liner material on the morphology of deposited Cu and give, for the first time, a tool to predict metal deposition on technologically important substrates. We study Cu deposition at different partial pressures on a series of substrates, including unmodified TaN and TaN with 25% or 50% surface Ru incorporation, at deposition temperatures of 300 K, 500 K and 800 K. The deposition simulations predict Cu film roughness, island size and number, substrate exposure area (as a measure of 2D vs. 3D morphology), layer occupation rate, compactness (as a measure of film quality) and the impact of annealing. As-deposited Cu on unmodified TaN exhibits significantly higher roughness and substrate exposure areas, demonstrating island formation...</description>

Abstract: We report an extensive molecular dynamics study of ab-initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium upon crossing the transition temperature. We find that the macroscopic polarization appears/disappears due to dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also compute the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. For a long time, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation due to the thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model under state-dependent time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear one-dimensional FitzHugh--Nagumo neuronal model with an asymmetric potential driven by both a high-frequency and a low-frequency signal. Our numerical analysis focuses on the influence of a state-dependent time delay on vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance phenomena. The response amplitude at the low-frequency is explored to characterize the vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance. By this effort, we realize that for smaller values of the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component, vibrational resonance and multi-resonance occur in the neuronal model. For large values of the high-frequency excitation amplitude, vibrational resonance appears with one peak. We observe a decrease in the response when the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component increases. Also, we analyze how the state-dependent time-delay position and velocity components can give birth to delay-induced resonance for separate and together. The main results of this work are that the state-dependent time-delay velocity component can play a major role in both phenomena. In fact the parameter of the delay can control the triggering of the two resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate wavelet-like localized solutions in nonlinear waveguides, enabled by complementary propagation constants embedded in domains of anomalous dispersion. They are carrier-envelope-phase stable and independent of fine details of the dispersion profile. Their spectra extend over vast ranges and they are also robust against nonlinear perturbations, providing properties highly demanded in ultrafast science. In the limits of low and high energies, approximate representations are given by modified Morlet wavelets and Gaussian pulses, respectively. We demonstrate their special features by exploiting general principles of quantum scattering theory and solid-state physics, realizing interlocked chains of wavelets analog to photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>Activating the Basal Plane of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides via High-Entropy Alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in the 2H or 1T crystal phases, are promising (electro)catalyst candidates due to their high surface to volume ratio and composition of low-cost, abundant elements. While the edges of elemental TMDC nanoparticles, such as MoS$_2$, can show significant catalytic activity, the basal plane of the pristine materials are notoriously inert, which limits their normalized activity. Here we show that high densities of catalytically active sites can be formed on the TMDC basal plane by alloying elements that prefer the 2H (1T) phase into a 1T (2H) structure. The global stability of the alloy, in particular whether it crystallizes in the 2H or 1T phase, can be controlled by ensuring a majority of elements preferring the target phase. We further show that the mixing entropy plays a decisive role for stabilizing the alloy implying that high-entropy alloying becomes essential. Our calculations point to a number of interesting non-precious hydrogen evolution catalysts, including (CrHfTaVZr)S$_2$ and (CrNbTiVZr)S$_2$ in the T-phase and (MoNbTaVTi)S$_2$ in the H-phase. Our work opens new directions for designing catalytic sites via high-entropy alloy stabilization of locally unstable structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, aerospace engineering, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctorily neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. This force arises from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles and, since it depends on the particles' past history, complicates the dynamics by transforming their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. This study addresses the following question: Under what conditions can the Basset-Boussinesq force be neglected in light particles in geophysical flows? We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force is negligible when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particle's Stokes time. Interestingly, for most oceanic particles this force may be negligible. Only for very strong stratification, or for particles with very large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the basis of adiabatic electronic and nuclear position states, where a compact and complete expression for nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) Hamiltonian term is obtained, we provide a general analysis of the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate expression for nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic states. We then consider a quasi-adiabatic approximation that uses crude adiabatic states evaluated at the minimum potential energy configuration of the initial adiabatic state as the basis for the zeroth order adiabatic and NDC coupling terms of the Hamiltonian. Although application of this approximation is rather limited, it allows deriving a general FGR rate expression without further approximation and still accounts for non-Condon effect arising from momentum operators of NDC terms and its coupling with vibronic displacements. For a generic and widely used model where all nuclear degrees of freedom and environmental effects are represented as linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, we derive a closed form FGR rate expression that requires only Fourier transform. The resulting rate expression includes quadratic contributions of NDC terms and their couplings to Franck-Condon modes, which require evaluation of two additional bath spectral densities in addition to conventional one that appears in a typical FGR rate theory based on the Condon approximation. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and an Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression. We then apply our theoretical expression to the nonradiative decay from the first excited singlet state of azulene, which illustrates the utility and implications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a code for Time-Reversible Astrophysical Close Encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TRACE, an almost time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed time-step symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez &amp; Dehnen. In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases, TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases, TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 12x speed-up. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 15x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 41x speed-up. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach in quantum field theories to estimate the action using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The estimation is achieved by learning on system configurations governed by the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-S}$ at different temperatures within the imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory. We focus on 0+1 dimensional quantum field with kink/anti-kink configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles. This capability is especially valuable for the detailed exploration of phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and foreseeable quantum hardware introduce noise into computations, requiring algorithms that make judicious use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Under these restrictions, variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. A classical device performs nonlinear computations, and a quantum one uses a variational solver for the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. Multigrid preconditioning of the Poisson problem helps avoid local minima and reduces resource requirements for the quantum device. A quantum state readout technique called HTree is used for the first time on a physical problem. Htree is appropriate for real-valued problems and achieves linear complexity in the qubit count, making the Navier-Stokes solve further tractable on current quantum devices. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-impact ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules are essential for plasma modelling. However, experimentally determining the absolute cross sections is not easy, and ab initio calculations become computationally prohibitive as molecular complexity increases. Existing AI-based prediction methods suffer from limited data availability and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose DeepCSNet, a deep learning approach designed to predict electron-impact ionization cross sections using limited training data. We present two configurations of DeepCSNet: one tailored for specific molecules and another for various molecules. Both configurations can typically achieve a relative L2 error less than 5%. The present numerical results, focusing on electron-impact doubly differential ionization cross sections, demonstrate DeepCSNet's generalization ability, predicting cross sections across a wide range of energies and incident angles. Additionally, DeepCSNet shows promising results in predicting cross sections for molecules not included in the training set, even large molecules with more than 10 constituent atoms, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a robust framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by approximating their solutions via neural networks and imposing physics-based constraints on the loss function. Traditionally, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have been the neural network of choice, with significant progress made in optimizing their training. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs, achieving up to 84 times faster training times than the original KAN implementation. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, introducing an adaptive state transition technique to avoid loss function peaks between grid extensions, and a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that the adaptive features significantly enhance solution accuracy, decreasing the L^2 error relative to the reference solution by up to 43.02%. For the studied PDEs, our methodology approaches or surpasses the results obtained from architectures that utilize up to 8.5 times more parameters, highlighting the potential of adaptive, grid-dependent PIKANs as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Spectral Informed Neural Network: An Efficient and Low-Memory PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16414</link>

Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>

Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration of Numerical Atomic Orbitals-Based Density Functional Theory Algorithms within the ABACUS package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the fast developments of high-performance computing, first-principles methods based on quantum mechanics play a significant role in materials research, serving as fundamental tools for predicting and analyzing various properties of materials. However, the inherent complexity and substantial computational demands of first-principles algorithms, such as density functional theory, limit their use in larger systems. The rapid development of heterogeneous computing, particularly General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), has heralded new prospects for enhancing the performance and cost-effectiveness of first-principles algorithms. We utilize GPGPUs to accelerate the electronic structure algorithms in Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC (ABACUS), a first-principles computational package based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set. We design algorithms on GPGPU to efficiently construct and diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a given system, including the related force and stress calculations.The effectiveness of this computational acceleration has been demonstrated through calculations on twisted bilayer graphene with the system size up to 10,444 atoms.</description>
