      <title>Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>mmWave Radar for Sit-to-Stand Analysis: A Comparative Study with Wearables and Kinect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology. The goal is to develop a non-contact sensing, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational method for healthcare applications, including fall risk assessment. We used a 60GHz mmWave radar system to collect radar point cloud data, capturing STS motions from 45 participants. By employing a deep learning pose estimation model, we learned the human skeleton from Kinect built-in body tracking and applied Inverse Kinematics (IK) to calculate joint angles, segment STS motions, and extract commonly used features in fall risk assessment. Radar extracted features were then compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of mmWave radar in capturing general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk). Additionally, the study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of individual sensors and suggests the potential of integrated sensor technologies to improve the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research settings.</description>

      <title>The CTSkills App -- Measuring Problem Decomposition Skills of Students in Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incorporation of problem decomposition skills as an important component of computational thinking (CT) in K-12 computer science (CS) education. Despite the growing integration of CS in schools, there is a lack of consensus on the precise definition of CT in general and decomposition in particular. While decomposition is commonly referred to as the starting point of (computational) problem-solving, algorithmic solution formulation often receives more attention in the classroom, while decomposition remains rather unexplored. This study presents "CTSKills", a web-based skill assessment tool developed to measure students' problem decomposition skills. With the data collected from 75 students in grades 4-9, this research aims to contribute to a baseline of students' decomposition proficiency in compulsory education. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of a given problem is becoming increasingly important with the advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can effectively support the process of formulating algorithms. This study highlights the importance of problem decomposition as a key skill in K-12 CS education to foster more adept problem solvers.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Simulation Framework for CXL Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a pivotal technology for memory disaggregation in future heterogeneous computing systems, enabling on-demand memory expansion and improved resource utilization. Despite its potential, CXL is in its early stages with limited market products, highlighting the need for a reliable system-level simulation tool. This paper introduces CXL-DMSim, an open-source, high-fidelity full-system simulator for CXL disaggregated memory systems, comparable in speed to gem5. CXL-DMSim includes a flexible CXL memory expander model, device driver, and support for CXL\.io and CXL\.mem protocols. It supports both app-managed and kernel-managed modes, with the latter featuring a NUMA-compatible mechanism. Rigorous verification against real hardware testbeds with FPGA-based and ASIC-based CXL memory prototypes confirms CXL-DMSim's accuracy, with an average simulation error of 4.1%. Benchmark results using LMbench and STREAM indicate that CXL-FPGA memory has approximately ~2.88x higher latency than local DDR, while CXL-ASIC latency is about ~2.18x. CXL-FPGA achieves 45-69% of local DDR's memory bandwidth, and CXL-ASIC reaches 82-83%. The performance of CXL memory is significantly more sensitive to Rd/Wr patterns than local DDR, with optimal bandwidth at a 74%:26% ratio rather than 50%:50% due to the current CXL+DDR controller design. The study also shows that CXL memory can markedly enhance the performance of memory-intensive applications, with the most improvement seen in Viper (~23x) and in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios like MERCI (16%). CXL-DMSim's observability and expandability are demonstrated through detailed case studies, showcasing its potential for research on future CXL-interconnected hybrid memory pools.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</description>
