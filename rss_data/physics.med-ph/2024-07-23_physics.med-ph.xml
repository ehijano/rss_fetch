      <title>A Minibatch Alternating Projections Algorithm for Robust and Efficient Magnitude Least-Squares RF Pulse Design in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnitude-least-squares radiofrequency pulse design algorithm is reported which uses interleaved exact and stochastically-generated inexact updates to escape local minima and find low-cost solutions. Inexact updates are performed using a small randomly selected minibatch of the available B1+ measurements to update RF pulse weights, which perturbs the sequence of alternating projections. Applications to RF shimming, parallel transmit spokes RF pulse design, and spectral-spatial RF pulse design are considered. Numerical and simulation studies characterized the optimal minibatch size, which was found to consistently produce lower power and lower RMSE solutions across subjects, coil geometries, B1+ resolutions and orientations. The method was validated in-vivo at 7 Tesla and produced improvements in image quality in a slice-by-slice RF-shimmed imaging sequence. Compared to conventional methods, the pulse design method can more robustly design RF pulses that correct for B1+ inhomogeneities at ultra-high field strengths, and enable pulse designs to be completed with increased computational efficiency</description>

      <title>Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Poiseuille Flow in Tubes of Bipolar Cross Sections: An exact hemodynamic analysis for potential mechanisms of aortopathy in bicuspid aortic valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady blood flow, or Poiseuille flow, through compressed or defective blood vessels is a critical issue in hemodynamics, particularly in cardiovascular studies. This research explores a tube with a bipolar cross-section, simulating the geometry of a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) during an oval systolic opening. The BAV, typically featuring two cusps instead of the usual three found in normal tricuspid configurations, introduces unique hemodynamic challenges. As the most prevalent congenital heart defect, BAV increases the risk of aortic dilation and dissection. A bipolar cross-sectional analysis provides a more accurate geometric approximation for modeling flow through these atypical valve shapes, crucial for understanding the specific fluid dynamics associated with BAV. We derived an exact solution for the governing equations of Poiseuille flow within a bipolar cross-sectional tube, including velocity field, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS). The velocity profiles for BAV show remarkable agreement with previous studies using coherent multi-scale simulations, consistently demonstrating a jet-like flow structure absent in tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) scenarios. Analysis reveals that at the center of the entrance, BAV blood flow velocity is significantly higher than TAV but decreases more rapidly towards the vessel wall, creating a steeper vertical velocity gradient and resulting in higher WSS for BAV. Additionally, the WSS, inversely proportional to sin({\xi}*), where {\xi}* represents the bipolar coordinate at the wall boundary, exceeds that found in a circular cylindrical tube with an equivalent diameter. In cases of aortic valve stenosis, where {\xi}* approaches {\pi}, the WSS increases rapidly. This elevated WSS, commonly observed in BAV patients, may detrimentally impact the aortic wall in these structurally abnormal valves, particularly within the ascending aorta.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the treatment effect of FLASH radiotherapy with Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) can also work as a powerful and excellent synchrotron light source, which can generate high-quality synchrotron radiation. This synchrotron radiation has potential advantages in the medical field, with a broad spectrum, with energies ranging from visible light to x-rays used in conventional radiotherapy, up to several MeV. FLASH radiotherapy is one of the most advanced radiotherapy modalities. It is a radiotherapy method that uses ultra-high dose rate irradiation to achieve the treatment dose in an instant; the ultra-high dose rate used is generally greater than 40 Gy/s, and this type of radiotherapy can protect normal tissues well. In this paper, the treatment effect of CEPC synchrotron radiation for FLASH radiotherapy was evaluated by simulation. First, Geant4 simulation was used to build a synchrotron radiation radiotherapy beamline station, and then the dose rate that CEPC can produce was calculated. Then, a physicochemical model of radiotherapy response kinetics was established, and a large number of radiotherapy experimental data were comprehensively used to fit and determine the functional relationship between the treatment effect, dose rate and dose. Finally, the macroscopic treatment effect of FLASH radiotherapy was predicted using CEPC synchrotron radiation light through the dose rate and the above-mentioned functional relationship. The results show that CEPC synchrotron radiation beam is one of the best beams for FLASH radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Clinical Validation of myOSLchip system for Radiotherapy Dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radiation oncology, inter-fractional dosimetry is often performed with luminescent dosimeters to verify the accurate delivery of a plan and ensure patient safety. Optically stimulated luminescent detectors (OSLDs) are the most commonly used detector type which offers good dose linearity and accuracy in the megavoltage energy range. Freiberg Instruments offer a dosimetry system under the brand name myOLSchip which consists of a BeO OSL dosimeter, reader, and eraser. A Varian Truebeam was used to characterize the detectors and calibrate their response in order to perform in-situ dosimetry during treatment. The OSLDs were tested with both photon and electron beams from 6-15 MV and 6-20 MV respectively. The dose signal to dose conversion in this investigation follows the recommendations of TG-191 in developing a dose response curve and creating a batch calibration factor for each dosimeter. The repeatability of this system is also investigated following successive erasing and re-irradiation cycles. The results of this data have been compared to the stated accuracy and precision of the BeO detectors by the manufacturer and shown to have good dose linearity and repeatability across multiple exposures and erasure cycles.</description>

      <title>Does EDPVR Represent Myocardial Tissue Stiffness? Toward a Better Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate assessment of myocardial tissue stiffness is pivotal for the diagnosis and prognosis of heart diseases. Left ventricular diastolic stiffness ($\beta$) obtained from the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) has conventionally been utilized as a representative metric of myocardial stiffness. The EDPVR can be employed to estimate the intrinsic stiffness of myocardial tissues through image-based in-silico inverse optimization. However, whether $\beta$, as an organ-level metric, accurately represents the tissue-level myocardial tissue stiffness in healthy and diseased myocardium remains elusive. We developed a modeling-based approach utilizing a two-parameter material model for the myocardium (denoted by $a_f$ and $b_f$) in image-based in-silico biventricular heart models to generate EDPVRs for different material parameters. Our results indicated a variable relationship between $\beta$ and the material parameters depending on the range of the parameters. Interestingly, $\beta$ showed a very low sensitivity to $a_f$, once averaged across several LV geometries, and even a negative correlation with $a_f$ for small values of $a_f$. These findings call for a critical assessment of the reliability and confoundedness of EDPVR-derived metrics to represent tissue-level myocardial stiffness. Our results also underscore the necessity to explore image-based in-silico frameworks, promising to provide a high-fidelity and potentially non-invasive assessment of myocardial stiffness.</description>

      <title>3D-printed axicon enables extended depth-of-focus intravascular optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in endoscopy is how to fabricate a small fiber-optic probe that can achieve comparable function to probes with large, complicated optics (e.g., high resolution and extended depth of focus). To achieve high resolution over an extended depth of focus (DOF), the application of needle-like beams has been proposed. However, existing methods using miniaturized needle beam designs fail to adequately correct astigmatism and other monochromatic aberrations, limiting the resolution of at least one axis. Here, we describe a novel approach to realize freeform beam-shaping endoscopic probes via two-photon direct laser writing, also known as micro 3D-printing. We present a design achieving approximately 8-micron resolution with a DOF of &gt;0.8 mm at a central wavelength of 1310 nm. The probe has a diameter of 0.25 mm (without the catheter sheaths) and is fabricated using a single printing step directly on the optical fiber. We demonstrate our device in intravascular imaging of living atherosclerotic pigs at multiple time points, as well as human arteries with plaques ex vivo. This is the first step to enable beam-tailoring endoscopic probes which achieve diffraction-limited resolution over a large DOF.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive Extraction of Maternal and Fetal ECG using Periodic Progressive FastICA Peel-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) gives a safe and non-invasive way to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. However, due to the overlap with maternal ECG (MECG) as well as significant external noise, it is challenging to extract weak fetal ECG (FECG) using surface electrodes. In this study, we introduce a novel periodic progressive FastICA peel-off (PPFP) method for noninvasive extraction of weak surface FECG signals, leveraging the two-step FastICA method and a peel-off strategy from the progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) approach. Specifically, for ECG signals, the periodic constrained FastICA that integrates ECG signal characteristics enables precise extraction of MECG and FECG spike trains. Additionally, a peel-off strategy incorporating SVD waveform reconstruction ensures comprehensive identification of subtle source signals. The performance of the proposed method was examined on public datasets with reference, synthetic data and clinical data, with an F1-scores for FECG extraction on public dataset of 99.59%, on synthetic data with the highest noise level of 99.50%, which are all superior to other comparative methods. Furthermore, clearly periodic and physiologically consistent FECG signals were extracted from clinically collected data. The results indicates that our proposed method has potential and effectiveness to separate MECG and weak FECG from multichannel AECG with high precision in high noise condition, which is of vital importance for ensuring the safety of both the fetus and the mother, as well as the advancement of artificial intelligent clinical monitoring.</description>
