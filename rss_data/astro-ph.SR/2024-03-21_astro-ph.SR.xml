      <title>Mass-Radius relation for magnetized white dwarfs from SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the observational mass-radius (M-R) relation for a sample of 47 magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) with the magnetic field strength (B) ranging from 1 to 773 MG, identified from the SDSS data release 7 (DR7). We derive their effective temperature, surface gravity (log g), luminosity, radius, and mass. While atmospheric parameters are derived using a Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA), the mass is derived using their location in the HR diagram in comparison with the evolutionary tracks of different masses. We implement this mass measurement instead of a more traditional method of deriving masses from log g, which is unreliable as is based on SED and generates errors from other physical parameters involved. The main disadvantage of this method is that we need to assume a core composition of WDs. As it is complicated to identify the exact composition of these WDs from low-resolution spectra, we use tracks for the masses 0.2 to 0.4 solar mass assuming a He-core, 0.5 to 1.0 solar mass assuming CO core, and above solar mass assuming O-Ne-Mg core. We compare the observed M-R relation with those predicted by the finite temperature model by considering different B, which are well in agreement considering their relatively low surface fields, less than or of the order of 10^9 G. Currently, there is no direct observational detection of magnetized WDs with B &gt; 10^9 G. We propose that our model can be further extrapolated to higher B, which may indicate the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass (M &gt; 1.4 solar mass) WDs at higher B.</description>

      <title>Eta Carinae left a curious ladder to climb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eta Carinae underwent the Great Eruption in the 1840s and a Lesser Eruption in the 1890s. Its apparent spectrum, modified by intervening ejecta, the Homunculus and Little Homunculus, continues to evolve but contains information pertaining to events in the 19th century. The LOS spectrum contains narrow absorption velocities, from -122 to -1665 km/s: rungs of a broken ladder caused by shells formed by the interacting winds. Estimated shell origin dates correlate with origin dates of expanding emission structures preceding the Great Eruption. The LOS absorption velocities extend the record post Great Eruption to the Lesser Eruption. We suggest that these shells originated from a binary merger within a triple system. Shells formed not only from periastron passages of the current secondary, but also from ear-like extensions preceding and following the periastron event. Additional models need to be considered.</description>

      <title>Observations of Locally Excited Waves in the Low Solar Atmosphere Using the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interpretation of the recent Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) observations of propagating wavefronts in the lower solar atmosphere. Using MPS/University of Chicago MHD (MURaM) radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning solar photosphere, overshoot region, and lower chromosphere, we identify three acoustic-wave source mechanisms, each occurring at a different atmospheric height. We synthesize the DKIST Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) G-band, blue-continuum, and CaIIK signatures of these waves at high spatial and temporal resolution, and conclude that the wavefronts observed by DKIST likely originate from acoustic sources at the top of the solar photosphere overshoot region and in the chromosphere proper. The overall importance of these local sources to the atmospheric energy and momentum budget of the solar atmosphere is unknown, but one of the excitation mechanism identified (upward propagating shock interaction with down-welling chromospheric plasma resulting in acoustic radiation) appears to be an important shock dissipation mechanism. Additionally, the observed wavefronts may prove useful for ultra-local helioseismological inversions and promise to play an important diagnostic role at multiple atmospheric heights.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on Period change in Magellanic Cepheids I. New binary systems revealed from Light Travel Time Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XIII: Aligned Disks with Non-Settled Dust Around the Newly Resolved Class 0 Protobinary R CrA IRAS 32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than $\sim$10$^5$ years, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and nine other molecular lines that trace disk, envelope, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of $\sim$0.03$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disk-like structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9$\pm$0.3 and 22.8$\pm$0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5$\pm$1.1 and 12.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\Earth}$. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disk-like structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the $^{13}$CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>A theoretic analysis of magnetoactive GES-based turbulent solar plasma instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently reported gravito-electrostatic sheath (GES) model is procedurally applied to study the turbumagnetoactive helioseismic oscillation features on the entire bi-fluidic solar plasma system. The bounded solar interior plasma (SIP, internally self-gravitating) and the unbounded solar wind plasma (SWP, externally point-gravitating) are coupled through the interfacial diffused solar surface boundary (SSB) due to an exact gravito-electrostatic interplay. A numerical platform on the developed theoretic formalism reveals the evolution of both dispersive and non-dispersive features of the modified GES mode fluctuations in new parametric windows. Different colourspectral profiles exhibit important features of the GES-based SIP-SWP perturbations elaborately. It is illustratively shown that the thermostatistical GES stability depends mainly on the radial distance, magnetic field, equilibrium plasma density, and plasma temperature. We see that their dispersive features are more pertinently pronounced in the self-gravitational domains (SIP) than the electrostatic ones (SWP). Besides, different characteristic parameters with accelerating (or decelerating) and stabilizing (or destabilizing) effects influencing the entire solar plasma stability are illustratively portrayed. We speculate that, in the SIP, the long-wave (gravitational-like) helioseismic fluctuations become highly dispersive showing more propagatory nature than the shorter ones (acoustic-like). The short waves show more propagatory propensity than the longer ones in the SSB and SWP regime. The reliability of our proposed investigation is bolstered along with the tentative applicability and future scope in light of the current solar observational scenarios, such as SOHO, STEREO, SDO, PSP, and SolO.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismological analysis of the non-Blazhko RRab star EPIC~248846335 in LAMOST -- Kepler$/$ K2 project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an asteroseismological analysis on the non-Blazhko ab-type RR Lyrae star EPIC 248846335 employing the Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP) module of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) based on the set of stellar parameters. The atmospheric parameters as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6933$\pm$70 $K$, log $g$ = 3.35$\pm$ 0.50 and [Fe/H] = -1.18 $\pm$ 0.14 are estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR9. The luminosity $L$ = 49.70$_{-1.80}^{+2.99}$ $L_\odot$ and mass M = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.07 $M_\odot$ are calculated, respectively, using the distance provided by Gaia and the metallicity estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra. The Fourier parameters of the light curves observed by $K2$ and RV curves determined from the Medium-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR10 are also calculated in this work. The period of the fundamental mode of the star and the residuals $r$ of the Fourier parameters between the models and observations serve to select optimal model, whose stellar parameters are $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6700 $\pm$ 220 K, log $g$ = 2.70, [Fe/H] = -1.20 $\pm$ 0.2, M = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$, and $L$ = 56.0 $\pm$ 4.2 $L_\odot$. The projection factors are constrained as 1.20 $\pm$ 0.02 and 1.59 $\pm$ 0.13 by the blue- and red-arm observed velocities with their corresponding RV curves derived from the best-fit model, respectively. The precise determination of stellar parameters in ab-type RR Lyrae stars is crucial for understanding the physical processes that occur during pulsation and for providing a deeper understanding of its Period-Luminosity relationship.</description>

      <title>Gaia23ckh: Symbiotic outburst of the assumed Mira variable V390 Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The poorly studied variable star V390 Sco, previously classified as a Mira pulsator, was detected in a brightening event by the ESA Gaia satellite in September 2023. This work presents an analysis of available archival multifrequency photometric data of this target, along with our spectroscopic observations. Our findings lead to the conclusion that V390 Sco is a new symbiotic star identified by Gaia, currently undergoing a classical symbiotic outburst. Additionally, we uncovered three prior outbursts of this system through archival photometry. The outbursts recur approximately every 2330 - 2400 days, and we hypothesize the periastron passage in an eccentric orbit may trigger them, similarly to the case of BX Mon, DD Mic, or MWC 560. A detailed investigation into the nature of the donor star suggested that V390 Sco is an S-type symbiotic star, likely hosting a less evolved, semiregularly pulsating giant donor, but not a Mira variable.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in the Yellow Hypergiant domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) are massive stars that are commonly interpreted to be in a post-red supergiant evolutionary state. These objects can undergo outbursts on timescales of decades, which are suspected to be due to instabilities in the envelope. To test this conjecture, the stability of envelope models for YHGs with respect to infinitesimal, radial perturbations is investigated. Violent strange mode instabilities with growth rates in the dynamical regime are identified if the luminosity to mass ratio exceeds $\approx 10^4$ in solar units. For the observed parameters of YHGs we thus predict instability. The strange mode instabilities persist over the entire range of effective temperatures from red to blue supergiants. Due to short thermal timescales and dominant radiation pressure in the envelopes of YHGs, a nonadiabatic stability analysis is mandatory and an adiabatic analysis being the basis of the common perception is irrelevant. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, the models considered here do not exhibit any adiabatic instability.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the magnetism of a near-limb sunspot on height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical parameters of the sunspot are not fully understood, especially the height dependence of the magnetic field. So far, it is also an open question as to which heights the He I 1083 nm spectral line is formed at. Our aim is to investigate the magnetic and dynamical properties in the atmosphere above a sunspot, from the photosphere to the chromosphere. We analyzed the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic field properties of a stable sunspot in AR 12553 on June 20, 2016 using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with GRIS at GREGOR. A spectral-line inversion technique was used to infer the magnetic field vector and Doppler velocities from the full Stokes profiles. In total, three spectral lines were inverted and the variation of the magnetic properties was qualified using the average values of the radial circles. The sunspot is located close to the solar limb, and thus this allows us to make a geometrical determination of the height of the spectral line He I 1083 nm. We find the height of helium spectral line to be 970 km above the photospheric spectral lines directly from observation at a stable sunspot. The total magnetic field strength decreases with height over the sunspot; the rates are -0.34 G/km for the umbra and -0.28 G/km for the penumbra. The inclination increases with increasing height in the umbra, but decreases in the penumbra. In the umbra, the vertical component ($B_z$) decreases with height, while the horizontal component ($B_{hor}$) remains almost constant. In the penumbra this is reversed, as $B_z$ remains nearly constant over height, while $B_{hor}$ decreases. We also observe fast velocities with 30 km/s in small chromospheric patches on the central side of the spot. The key parameters depending on height in the sunspot are the $B_{z}$ component of the magnetic field for the umbra and the $B_{hor}$ component of the magnetic field for the penumbra.</description>

      <title>Resonant Ion Radiation Scattering and the Integrated Atomic Cross-Section as applied to Binary Star Shock Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current literature is rather vague regarding how to calculate the exact numerical value of the resonant ion scattering cross-section that should be used for a specific bandpass of finite width. Such a value was needed in order to calculate the ion and mass densities in the shock fronts of hot, close binary star systems. This was done based on a modeling of ultraviolet wind-line profiles, using IUE spectra. Therefore, a numerical integration has been carried out, in wavelength-space, of the exact expression for the cross-section over two band-passes of astrophysical interest. The exact expression employed was that derived from a solution of the Abraham-Lorentz equation. The numerical results depend on the resonant wavelength, which is taken to be at the center of the bandpass. Most texts on the subject derive an expression for the scattering cross-section in frequency-space, based on the assumption that the radiation reaction term in the Abraham-Lorentz equation may be approximated by a resistive term. The integral of this cross-section over the entire spectrum is independent of the resonant frequency, except for the transition probability. This has limited practical use when dealing with fluxes measured in a bandpass of finite width expressed in wavelength units and scattering is the only mechanism for producing the observed fluxes. Such is the case when dealing with the low densities encountered in stellar winds and shock fronts.
  Integrated cross-sections that depend on the resonant wavelength are used to determine the number and mass densities of C IV and N V ions in the shock fronts found in some hot, eclipsing binary star systems, for which several IUE spectra have been obtained over a Keplerian orbital period. This then leans to a determination of the mass density and total mass in the shock once the volume of the shock is determined.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en Pulse Driven Spicule-like Jets in the Presence of Thermal Conduction and Ion-Neutral Collision in Two-Fluid Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formation of quasi-periodic cool spicule-like jets in the solar atmosphere using 2.5-D numerical simulation in two-fluid regime (ions+neutrals) under the presence of thermal conduction and ion-neutral collision. The non-linear, impulsive Alfv\'enic perturbations at the top of the photosphere trigger field aligned magnetoacoustic perturbations due to ponderomotive force. The transport of energy from Alfv\'en pulse to such vertical velocity perturbations due to ponderomotive force is considered as an initial trigger mechanism. Thereafter, these velocity perturbations steepen into the shocks followed by quasi-periodic rise and fall of the cool jets transporting mass in the overlying corona.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral towards one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Characterization of starspots on a young M-dwarf K2-25: multi-band observations of stellar photometric variability and planetary transits</title>

Abstract: Detailed atmospheric characterization of exoplanets by transmission spectroscopy requires careful consideration of stellar surface inhomogeneities induced by starspots. This effect is particularly problematic for planetary systems around M-dwarfs, and their spot properties are not fully understood. We investigated the stellar activity of the young M-dwarf K2-25 and its effect on transit observations of the sub-Neptune K2-25b. From multi-band monitoring observations of stellar brightness variability using ground-based telescopes and TESS, we found that the temperature difference between the spots and photosphere is &lt;190 K and the spot covering fraction is &lt;61% (2$\sigma$). We also investigated the effect of starspot activity using multi-epoch, multi-band transit observations. We rule out cases with extremely low spot temperatures and large spot covering fractions. The results suggest that spots could distort the transmission spectrum of K2-25b by as much as $\sim$100 ppm amplitude, corresponding to the precision of JWST/NIRSPEC of the target. Our study demonstrates that simultaneous multi-band observations with current instruments can constrain the spot properties of M-dwarfs with good enough precision to support atmospheric studies of young M-dwarf planets via transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the magnetic cataclysmic variable XMM J152737.4-205305.9 with a deep eclipse-like feature</title>

Abstract: In this study, we report a discovery from XMM-Newton, which involves the identification and subsequent examination of a newly discovered polar-type cataclysmic variable named XMM J152737.4-205305.9. The discovery was made by matching the XMM-Newton data archive with the cataclysmic variable candidate catalog provided by Gaia Data Release 3. The utilization of X-ray photometry has led to the identification of two distinct dips that exhibit a recurring pattern with a precise period of 112.4(1) minutes in two XMM-Newton observations that are one year apart. The data obtained from the photometry of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and ATLAS surveys consistently indicate the presence of the different mass accretion states of up to 2 mag. Following the optical data, the \textit{SRG}(Spectrum Roentgen Gamma)/eROSITA All Sky Survey observed the system in two different X-ray levels which may imply different accretion states. Following these observations, the low-resolution spectrum obtained using SALT spectroscopy exposes the prominent hydrogen Balmer and helium emission lines, strongly supporting that the system belongs to the category of polar-type magnetic cataclysmic variable. The XMM-Newton observations, conducted under various conditions of X-ray levels, reveal a consistent pattern of a deep dip-like feature with a width of $\approx 9.1$ min. This feature implies the presence of an eclipse in both observations. According to Gaia data, the object is located at a distance of $1156^{+720}_{-339}$,pc, and its X-ray luminosity lies within the $L_{\rm X}$= (3-6)$\times10^{31}$ \lergs range.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope images of SN 1987A: Evolution of the ejecta and the equatorial ring from 2009 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young supernova remnant (SNR). We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11 000 AA. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ~8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ~11000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well-mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg II resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly-ionized emission near the remnant's center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O III] HST image. The non-detection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si - S - Ar rich zone and/or that the observed [O III] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events from in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>870 Micron Dust Continuum of the Youngest Protostars in Ophiuchus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution (21 au) ALMA 870 $\mu$m continuum survey of 25 pointings containing 31 young stellar objects in the Ophiuchus molecular clouds. Using the dust continuum as a proxy for dust mass and circumstellar disk radius in our sample, we report a mean mass of 2.8$^{+2.1}_{-1.3}$ and 2.5$^{+9.2}_{-1.1}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a mean radii of 23.5$^{+1.8}_{-1.2}$ and 16.5$^{+2.8}_{-0.9}$ au, for Class I and Flat spectrum protostars, respectively. In addition, we calculate the multiplicity statistics of the dust surrounding young stellar objects in Ophiuchus. The multiplicity fraction (MF) and companion star fraction (CSF) of the combined Class I and Flats based solely on this work is 0.25 $\pm$ 0.09 and 0.33 $\pm$ 0.10, respectively, which are consistent with the values for Perseus and Orion. While we see clear differences in mass and radius between the Ophiuchus and Perseus/Orion protostellar surveys, we do not see any significant differences in the multiplicities of the various regions. We posit there are some differences in the conditions for star formation in Ophiuchus that strongly affects disk size (and consequently disk mass), but does not affect system multiplicity, which could imply important variation in planet formation processes.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI MRS Images Disk Winds, Water, and CO in an Edge-On Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST MIRI MRS observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the young sub-solar mass star Tau 042021, acquired as part of the Cycle 1 GO program "Mapping Inclined Disk Astrochemical Signatures (MIDAS)." These data resolve the mid-IR spatial distributions of H$_2$, revealing X-shaped emission extending to ~200 au above the disk midplane with a semi-opening angle of $35 \pm 5$ degrees. We do not velocity-resolve the gas in the spectral images, but the measured semi-opening angle of the H$_2$ is consistent with an MHD wind origin. A collimated, bipolar jet is seen in forbidden emission lines from [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ni II], [Fe II], [Ar II], and [S III]. Extended H$_2$O and CO emission lines are also detected, reaching diameters between ~90 and 190 au, respectively. Hot molecular emission is not expected at such radii, and we interpret its extended spatial distribution as scattering of inner disk molecular emission by dust grains in the outer disk surface. H I recombination lines, characteristic of inner disk accretion shocks, are similarly extended, and are likely also scattered light from the innermost star-disk interface. Finally, we detect extended PAH emission at 11.3 microns co-spatial with the scattered light continuum, making this the first low-mass T Tauri star around which extended PAHs have been confirmed, to our knowledge. MIRI MRS line images of edge-on disks provide an unprecedented window into the outflow, accretion, and scattering processes within protoplanetary disks, allowing us to constrain the disk lifetimes and accretion and mass loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."</description>
