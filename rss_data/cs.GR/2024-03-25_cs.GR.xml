      <title>GPolylla: Fully GPU-accelerated polygonal mesh generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a fully GPU-accelerated algorithm for the polygonal mesh generator known as Polylla. Polylla is a tri-to-polygon mesh generator, which benefits from the half-edge data structure to manage any polygonal shape. The proposed parallel algorithm introduces a novel approach to modify triangulations to get polygonal meshes using the half-edge data structure in parallel on the GPU. By changing the adjacency values of each half-edge, the algorithm accomplish to unlink half-edges that are not used in the new polygonal mesh without the need neither removing nor allocating new memory in the GPU. The experimental results show a speedup, reaching up to $\times 83.2$ when compared to the CPU sequential implementation. Additionally, the speedup is $\times 746.8$ when the cost of copying the data structure from the host device and back is not included.</description>

      <title>MOTIV: Visual Exploration of Moral Framing in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a visual computing framework for analyzing moral rhetoric on social media around controversial topics. Using Moral Foundation Theory, we propose a methodology for deconstructing and visualizing the \textit{when}, \textit{where}, and \textit{who} behind each of these moral dimensions as expressed in microblog data. We characterize the design of this framework, developed in collaboration with experts from language processing, communications, and causal inference. Our approach integrates microblog data with multiple sources of geospatial and temporal data, and leverages unsupervised machine learning (generalized additive models) to support collaborative hypothesis discovery and testing. We implement this approach in a system named MOTIV. We illustrate this approach on two problems, one related to Stay-at-home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Through detailed case studies and discussions with collaborators, we identify several insights discovered regarding the different drivers of moral sentiment in social media. Our results indicate that this visual approach supports rapid, collaborative hypothesis testing, and can help give insights into the underlying moral values behind controversial political issues.

      <title>Recent Trends in 3D Reconstruction of General Non-Rigid Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing models of the real world, including 3D geometry, appearance, and motion of real scenes, is essential for computer graphics and computer vision. It enables the synthesizing of photorealistic novel views, useful for the movie industry and AR/VR applications. It also facilitates the content creation necessary in computer games and AR/VR by avoiding laborious manual design processes. Further, such models are fundamental for intelligent computing systems that need to interpret real-world scenes and actions to act and interact safely with the human world. Notably, the world surrounding us is dynamic, and reconstructing models of dynamic, non-rigidly moving scenes is a severely underconstrained and challenging problem. This state-of-the-art report (STAR) offers the reader a comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art techniques with monocular and multi-view inputs such as data from RGB and RGB-D sensors, among others, conveying an understanding of different approaches, their potential applications, and promising further research directions. The report covers 3D reconstruction of general non-rigid scenes and further addresses the techniques for scene decomposition, editing and controlling, and generalizable and generative modeling. More specifically, we first review the common and fundamental concepts necessary to understand and navigate the field and then discuss the state-of-the-art techniques by reviewing recent approaches that use traditional and machine-learning-based neural representations, including a discussion on the newly enabled applications. The STAR is concluded with a discussion of the remaining limitations and open challenges.</description>

      <title>LeGO: Leveraging a Surface Deformation Network for Animatable Stylized Face Generation with One Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D face stylization have made significant strides in few to zero-shot settings. However, the degree of stylization achieved by existing methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations. To this end, we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar. The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses. Additionally, during the inference process, we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) that takes deformation target, a mesh of diverse topologies as input to the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of our method including image-based stylized avatar generation, linear interpolation of geometric styles, and facial animation of stylized avatars.</description>

      <title>LATTE3D: Large-scale Amortized Text-To-Enhanced3D Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-3D generation approaches produce impressive 3D results but require time-consuming optimization that can take up to an hour per prompt. Amortized methods like ATT3D optimize multiple prompts simultaneously to improve efficiency, enabling fast text-to-3D synthesis. However, they cannot capture high-frequency geometry and texture details and struggle to scale to large prompt sets, so they generalize poorly. We introduce LATTE3D, addressing these limitations to achieve fast, high-quality generation on a significantly larger prompt set. Key to our method is 1) building a scalable architecture and 2) leveraging 3D data during optimization through 3D-aware diffusion priors, shape regularization, and model initialization to achieve robustness to diverse and complex training prompts. LATTE3D amortizes both neural field and textured surface generation to produce highly detailed textured meshes in a single forward pass. LATTE3D generates 3D objects in 400ms, and can be further enhanced with fast test-time optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning to Importance Sample in Primary Sample Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Importance sampling is one of the most widely used variance reduction strategies in Monte Carlo rendering. In this paper, we propose a novel importance sampling technique that uses a neural network to learn how to sample from a desired density represented by a set of samples. Our approach considers an existing Monte Carlo rendering algorithm as a black box. During a scene-dependent training phase, we learn to generate samples with a desired density in the primary sample space of the rendering algorithm using maximum likelihood estimation. We leverage a recent neural network architecture that was designed to represent real-valued non-volume preserving ('Real NVP') transformations in high dimensional spaces. We use Real NVP to non-linearly warp primary sample space and obtain desired densities. In addition, Real NVP efficiently computes the determinant of the Jacobian of the warp, which is required to implement the change of integration variables implied by the warp. A main advantage of our approach is that it is agnostic of underlying light transport effects, and can be combined with many existing rendering techniques by treating them as a black box. We show that our approach leads to effective variance reduction in several practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>PointNeRF++: A multi-scale, point-based Neural Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point clouds offer an attractive source of information to complement images in neural scene representations, especially when few images are available. Neural rendering methods based on point clouds do exist, but they do not perform well when the point cloud quality is low -- e.g., sparse or incomplete, which is often the case with real-world data. We overcome these problems with a simple representation that aggregates point clouds at multiple scale levels with sparse voxel grids at different resolutions. To deal with point cloud sparsity, we average across multiple scale levels -- but only among those that are valid, i.e., that have enough neighboring points in proximity to the ray of a pixel. To help model areas without points, we add a global voxel at the coarsest scale, thus unifying ``classical'' and point-based NeRF formulations. We validate our method on the NeRF Synthetic, ScanNet, and KITTI-360 datasets, outperforming the state of the art, with a significant gap compared to other NeRF-based methods, especially on more challenging scenes.</description>

      <title>ToonAging: Face Re-Aging upon Artistic Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</description>

      <title>VisionGPT-3D: A Generalized Multimodal Agent for Enhanced 3D Vision Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of text to visual components facilitates people's daily lives, such as generating image, videos from text and identifying the desired elements within the images. Computer vision models involving the multimodal abilities in the previous days are focused on image detection, classification based on well-defined objects. Large language models (LLMs) introduces the transformation from nature language to visual objects, which present the visual layout for text contexts. OpenAI GPT-4 has emerged as the pinnacle in LLMs, while the computer vision (CV) domain boasts a plethora of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and algorithms to convert 2D images to their 3D representations. However, the mismatching between the algorithms with the problem could lead to undesired results. In response to this challenge, we propose an unified VisionGPT-3D framework to consolidate the state-of-the-art vision models, thereby facilitating the development of vision-oriented AI. VisionGPT-3D provides a versatile multimodal framework building upon the strengths of multimodal foundation models. It seamlessly integrates various SOTA vision models and brings the automation in the selection of SOTA vision models, identifies the suitable 3D mesh creation algorithms corresponding to 2D depth maps analysis, generates optimal results based on diverse multimodal inputs such as text prompts.
