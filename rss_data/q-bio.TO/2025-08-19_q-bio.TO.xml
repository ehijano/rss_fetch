      <title>Towards interpretable prediction of recurrence risk in breast cancer using pathology foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcriptomic assays such as the PAM50-based ROR-P score guide recurrence risk stratification in non-metastatic, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer but are not universally accessible. Histopathology is routinely available and may offer a scalable alternative. We introduce MAKO, a benchmarking framework evaluating 12 pathology foundation models and two non-pathology baselines for predicting ROR-P scores from H&amp;E-stained whole slide images using attention-based multiple instance learning. Models were trained and validated on the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and externally tested on TCGA BRCA. Several foundation models outperformed baselines across classification, regression, and survival tasks. CONCH achieved the highest ROC AUC, while H-optimus-0 and Virchow2 showed top correlation with continuous ROR-P scores. All pathology models stratified CBCS participants by recurrence similarly to transcriptomic ROR-P. Tumor regions were necessary and sufficient for high-risk predictions, and we identified candidate tissue biomarkers of recurrence. These results highlight the promise of interpretable, histology-based risk models in precision oncology.</description>

      <title>A stochastic agent-based model for simulating tumor-immune dynamics and evaluating therapeutic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor-immune interactions are central to cancer progression and treatment outcomes. In this study, we present a stochastic agent-based model that integrates cellular heterogeneity, spatial cell-cell interactions, and drug resistance evolution to simulate tumor growth and immune response in a two-dimensional microenvironment. The model captures dynamic behaviors of four major cell types--tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, and regulatory T cells--and incorporates key biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation. Using this framework, we simulate tumor progression under different therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our simulations reproduce emergent phenomena such as immune privilege and spatial immune exclusion. Quantitative analyses show that all therapies suppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor microenvironment. Notably, combination therapies--especially targeted therapy with immunotherapy--achieve the most effective tumor control and delay the emergence of resistance. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between treatment intensity and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the existence of optimal dosing thresholds. This work demonstrates the utility of agent-based modeling in capturing complex tumor-immune dynamics and provides a computational platform for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. The model is extensible, biologically interpretable, and well-suited for future integration with experimental or clinical data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.</description>
