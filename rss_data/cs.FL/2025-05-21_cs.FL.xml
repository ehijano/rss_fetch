      <title>A Complexity Dichotomy for Semilinear Target Sets in Automata with One Counter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many kinds of infinite-state systems, the coverability problem has significantly lower complexity than the reachability problem. In order to delineate the border of computational hardness between coverability and reachability, we propose to place these problems in a more general context, which makes it possible to prove complexity dichotomies.
  The more general setting arises as follows. We note that for coverability, we are given a vector $t$ and are asked if there is a reachable vector $x$ satisfying the relation $x\ge t$. For reachability, we want to satisfy the relation $x=t$. In the more general setting, there is a Presburger formula $\varphi(t,x)$, and we are given $t$ and are asked if there is a reachable $x$ with $\varphi(t,x)$.
  We study this setting for systems with one counter and binary updates: (i) integer VASS, (ii) Parikh automata, and (i) standard (non-negative) VASS. In each of these cases, reachability is NP-complete, but coverability is known to be in polynomial time. Our main results are three dichotomy theorems, one for each of the cases (i)--(iii). In each case, we show that for every $\varphi$, the problem is either NP-complete or belongs to $\mathsf{AC}^1$, a circuit complexity class within polynomial time. We also show that it is decidable on which side of the dichotomy a given formula falls.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Context-Free Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a relatively new field of computing, which utilises the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics to process data. The seminal paper of Moore et al. [2000] introduced quantum grammars wherein a set of amplitudes was attached to each production. However they did not study the final probability of the derived word. Aruja et al. [2025] considered conditions for the well-formedness of quantum context-free grammars (QCFGs), in order to ensure that the probabilty of the derived word does not exceed one. In this paper we propose certain necessary and sufficient conditions (also known as unitary conditions) for well-formedness of QCFGs</description>

      <title>Minimal History-Deterministic Co-Buchi Automata: Congruences and Passive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14304v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abu Radi and Kupferman (2019) demonstrated the efficient minimization of history-deterministic (transition-based) co-B\"uchi automata, building on the results of Kuperberg and Skrzypczak (2015). We give a congruence-based description of these minimal automata, and a self-contained proof of its correctness. We use this description based on congruences to create a passive learning algorithm that can learn minimal history-deterministic co-B\"uchi automata from a set of labeled example words. The algorithm runs in polynomial time on a given set of examples, and there is a characteristic set of examples of polynomial size for each minimal history-deterministic co-B\"uchi automaton.</description>

      <title>Maximal 2-dimensional binary words of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let d be an integer between 0 and 4, and W be a 2-dimensional word of dimensions h x w on the binary alphabet {0, 1}, where h, w in Z &gt; 0. Assume that each occurrence of the letter 1 in W is adjacent to at most d letters 1. We provide an exact formula for the maximum number of letters 1 that can occur in W for fixed (h, w). As a byproduct, we deduce an upper bound on the length of maximum snake polyominoes contained in a h x w rectangle.</description>
