      <title>On the regularization property of Levenberg-Marquardt method with Singular Scaling for nonlinear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in Applied Mathematics and Computation 474 (2024) 128688, a Levenberg-Marquardt method (LMM) with Singular Scaling was analyzed and successfully applied in parameter estimation problems in heat conduction where the use of a particular singular scaling matrix (semi-norm regularizer) provided approximate solutions of better quality than those of the classic LMM. Here we propose a regularization framework for the Levenberg-Marquardt method with Singular Scaling (LMMSS) applied to nonlinear inverse problems with noisy data. Assuming that the noise-free problem admits exact solutions (zero-residual case), we consider the LMMSS iteration where the regularization effect is induced by the choice of a possibly singular scaling matrix and an implicit control of the regularization parameter. The discrepancy principle is used to define a stopping index that ensures stability of the computed solutions with respect to data perturbations. Under a new Tangent Cone Condition, we prove that the iterates obtained with noisy data converge to a solution of the unperturbed problem as the noise level tends to zero. This work represents a first step toward the analysis of regularizing properties of the LMMSS method and extends previous results in the literature on regularizing LM-type methods.</description>

      <title>On general and complete multidimensional Riemann solvers for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a framework to design multidimensional Riemann solvers for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws on general unstructured polygonal Voronoi-like tessellations. In this framework we propose two simple but complete solvers. The first method is a direct extension of the Osher-Solomon Riemann solver to multiple space dimensions. Here, the multidimensional numerical dissipation is obtained by integrating the absolute value of the flux Jacobians over a dual triangular mesh around each node of the primal polygonal grid. The required nodal gradient is then evaluated on a local computational simplex involving the d+1 neighbors meeting at each corner. The second method is a genuinely multidimensional upwind flux. By introducing a fluctuation form of finite volume methods with corner fluxes, we show an equivalence with residual distribution schemes (RD). This naturally allows to construct genuinely multidimensional upwind corner fluxes starting from existing and well-known RD fluctuations. In particular, we explore the use of corner fluxes obtained from the so-called N scheme, i.e. the Roe's original optimal multidimensional upwind advection scheme.
  Both methods use the full eigenstructure of the underlying hyperbolic system and are therefore complete by construction. A simple higher order extension up to fourth order in space and time is then introduced at the aid of a CWENO reconstruction in space and an ADER approach in time, leading to a family of high order accurate fully-discrete one-step schemes based on genuinely multidimensional Riemann solvers.
  We present applications of our new numerical schemes to several test problems for the compressible Euler equations of gas-dyanamics. In particular, we show that the proposed schemes are at the same time carbuncle-free and preserve certain stationary shear waves exactly.</description>

      <title>Structured Column Subset Selection for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian inverse problems, where the experimental design variables have a certain multiway structure. Given $d$ different experimental variables with $m_i$ choices per design variable $1 \le i\le d$, the goal is to select $k_i \le m_i$ experiments per design variable. Previous work has related OED to the column subset selection problem by mapping the design variables to the columns of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$. However, this approach is applicable only to the case $d=1$ in which the columns can be selected independently. We develop an extension to the case where the design variables have a multi-way structure. Our approach is to map the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to a tensor and perform column subset selection on mode unfoldings of the tensor. We develop an algorithmic framework with three different algorithmic templates, and randomized variants of these algorithms. We analyze the computational cost of all the proposed algorithms and also develop greedy versions to facilitate comparisons. Numerical experiments on four different applications -- time-dependent inverse problems, seismic tomography, X-ray tomography, and flow reconstruction -- demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our methods for structured experimental design in Bayesian inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Gradient Method for Solving Linear Algebraic Systems - A Method Related to the Normal Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although it is relatively easy to apply, the gradient method often displays a disappointingly slow rate of convergence. Its convergence is specially based on the structure of the matrix of the algebraic linear system, and on the choice of the stepsize defining the new iteration. We propose here a simple and robust stabilization of the gradient method, which no longer assumes a structure on the matrix (neither symmetric, nor positive definite) to converge, and which no longer requires an approach on the choice of the stepsize. We establish the global convergence of the proposed stabilized algorithm under the only assumption of nonsingular matrix. Several numerical examples illustrating its performances are presented, where we have tested small and large scale linear systems, with and not structured matrices, and with well and ill conditioned matrices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Recovery in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates solution strategies for nonlinear problems in Hilbert spaces, such as nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in Sobolev spaces, when only finite measurements are available. We formulate this as a nonlinear optimal recovery prob- lem, establishing its well-posedness and proving its convergence to the true solution as the number of measurements increases. However, the resulting formulation might not have a finite-dimensional solution in general. We thus present a sufficient condition for the finite dimensionality of the solution, applicable to problems with well-defined point evaluation measurements. To address the broader setting, we introduce a relaxed nonlinear optimal recovery and provide a detailed convergence analysis. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate that our formulations and theoretical findings offer a comprehensive framework for solving nonlinear problems in infinite-dimensional spaces with limited data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Analysis and Design Using Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to demonstrate and discuss the applications of automatic differentiation (AD) for finding derivatives in PDE-constrained optimization problems and Jacobians in non-linear finite element analysis. The main idea is to localize the application of AD at the integration point level by combining it with the so-called Finite Element Operator Decomposition. The proposed methods are computationally effective, scalable, automatic, and non-intrusive, making them ideal for existing serial and parallel solvers and complex multiphysics applications. The performance is demonstrated on large-scale steady-state non-linear scalar problems. The chosen testbed, the MFEM library, is free and open-source finite element discretization library with proven scalability to thousands of parallel processes and state-of-the-art high-order discretization techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINN) to solve a relativistic Burgers equation in the exterior domain of a Schwarzschild black hole. Our main contribution is a PINN architecture that is able to simulate shock wave formations in such curved spacetime, by training a shock- aware network block and introducing a Godunov-inspired residuals in the loss function. We validate our method with numerical experiments with different kinds of initial conditions. We show its ability to reproduce both smooth and discontinuous solutions in the context of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of An Alternating Nonlinear GMRES on Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an alternating nonlinear Generalized Minimum Residual (NGMRES) algorithm with depth $m$ and periodicity $p$, denoted by aNGMRES($m,p$), applied to linear systems. We provide a theoretical analysis to quantify by how much aNGMRES($m$) can improve the convergence speed of the underlying fixed-point iteration for diagonalizable and symmetric positive definite cases. Our theoretical analysis gives us a better understanding of which factors affect the convergence speed. Moreover, under certain conditions, we prove the periodic equivalence between aNGMRES applied to Richardson iteration and GMRES. Specifically, aNGMRES($\infty,p$) and full GMRES are identical at the iteration index $jp$. aNGMRES($\infty,p$) can be regarded as an alternative to GMRES for solving linear systems. For finite $m$, the iterates of aNGMRES($m,m+1$) and restarted GMRES (GMRES($m+1$)) are the same at the end of each periodic interval of length $p$, i.e, at the iteration index $jp$. The advantages of aNGMRES($m,p$) method are that there is no need to solve a least-squares problem at each iteration which can reduce the computational cost, and it can enhance the robustness against stagnations, which could occur for NGMRES($m$).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stabilised finite element method for modelling proton transport in tissue, incorporating both inelastic energy loss and elastic angular scattering. A key innovation is a positivity-preserving formulation that guarantees non-negative fluence and dose, even on coarse meshes. This enables reliable computation of clinically relevant quantities for treatment planning. We derive a priori error estimates demonstrating optimal convergence rates and validate the method through numerical benchmarks. The proposed framework provides a robust, accurate and efficient tool for advancing proton beam therapy.</description>

      <title>Computing matrix $\varphi$-functions arising in exponential integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scaling and recovering algorithm is proposed for simultaneously computing the matrix $\varphi$-functions that arise in exponential integrator methods for the numerical solution of certain first-order systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The algorithm initially scales the input matrix down by a nonnegative integer power of two, then computes the $[m/m]$ diagonal Pad\'e approximant to $\varphi_p$, where $p$ is the largest index of interest. The remaining $[m+p{-}j/m]$ Pad\'e approximants to $\varphi_j$, $0 \le j &lt; p$, are obtained implicitly via a recurrence relation. The effect of scaling is subsequently recovered using the double-argument formula. A rigorous backward error analysis, based on the $[m+p/m]$ Pad\'e approximant to the exponential, enables sharp bounds on the relative backward errors. These bounds are expressed in terms of the sequence $\|A^k\|^{1/k}$, which can be much smaller than $\|A\|$ for nonnormal matrices. The scaling parameter and the degrees of the Pad\'e approximants are selected to minimize the overall computational cost, which benefits from the a priori sharpness of the bounds and the optimal evaluation schemes for diagonal Pad\'e approximants. Furthermore, if the input matrix is (quasi-)triangular, the algorithm exploits its structure in the recovering phase. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sharp error bounds for approximate eigenvalues and singular values from subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace methods are commonly used for finding approximate eigenvalues and singular values of large-scale matrices. Once a subspace is found, the Rayleigh-Ritz method (for symmetric eigenvalue problems) and Petrov-Galerkin projection (for singular values) are the de facto method for extraction of eigenvalues and singular values. In this work we derive quadratic error bounds for approximate eigenvalues obtained via the Rayleigh-Ritz process. Our bounds take advantage of the fact that extremal eigenpairs tend to converge faster than the rest, hence having smaller residuals $\|A\widehat x_i-\theta_i\widehat x_i\|_2$, where $(\theta_i,\widehat x_i)$ is a Ritz pair (approximate eigenpair). The proof uses the structure of the perturbation matrix underlying the Rayleigh-Ritz method to bound the components of its eigenvectors. In this way, we obtain a bound of the form $c\frac{\|A\widehat x_i-\theta_i\widehat x_i\|_2^2}{\eta_i}$, where $\eta_i$ is roughly the gap between the $i$th Ritz value and the eigenvalues that are not approximated by the Ritz process, and $c&gt; 1$ is a modest scalar. Our bound is adapted to each Ritz value and is robust to clustered Ritz values, which is a key improvement over existing results. We further show that the bound is asymptotically sharp, and generalize it to singular values of arbitrary real matrices. Finally, we apply these bounds to several methods for computing eigenvalues and singular values, and illustrate the sharpness of our bounds in a number of computational settings, including Krylov methods and randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that preserve transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective variables (CVs) play a crucial role in capturing rare events in high-dimensional systems, motivating the continual search for principled approaches to their design. In this work, we revisit the framework of quantitative coarse graining and identify the orthogonality condition from Legoll and Lelievre (2010) as a key criterion for constructing CVs that accurately preserve the statistical properties of the original process. We establish that satisfaction of the orthogonality condition enables error estimates for both relative entropy and pathwise distance to scale proportionally with the degree of scale separation. Building on this foundation, we introduce a general numerical method for designing neural network-based CVs that integrates tools from manifold learning with group-invariant featurization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct CVs for butane and achieve a CV that reproduces the anti-gauche transition rate with less than ten percent relative error. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence challenging the necessity of uniform positive definiteness in diffusion tensors for transition rate reproduction and highlight the critical role of light atoms in CV design for molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact operator inference with minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method to generate snapshot data for operator inference that guarantees the exact reconstruction of intrusive projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs). To ensure exact reconstruction, the operator inference least squares matrix must have full rank, without regularization. Existing works have achieved this full rank using heuristic strategies to generate snapshot data and a-posteriori checks on full rank, but without a guarantee of success. Our novel snapshot data generation method provides this guarantee thanks to two key ingredients: first we identify ROM states that induce full rank, then we generate snapshots corresponding to exactly these states by simulating multiple trajectories for only a single time step. This way, the number of required snapshots is minimal and orders of magnitude lower than typically reported with existing methods. The method avoids non-Markovian terms and does not require re-projection. Since the number of snapshots is minimal, the least squares problem simplifies to a linear system that is numerically more stable. In addition, because the inferred operators are exact, properties of the intrusive ROM operators such as symmetry or skew-symmetry are preserved. Numerical results for differential equations involving 2nd, 3rd and 8th order polynomials demonstrate that the novel snapshot data generation method leads to exact reconstruction of the intrusive reduced order models.</description>

      <title>Point Jacobi-type preconditioning and parameter tuning for Calderon-preconditioned Burton-Miller method in transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that the boundary element method based on the Burton-Miller formulation (BM-BEM), widely used for solving exterior problems, can be adapted to solve transmission problems efficiently. This approach utilises Calderon's identities to improve the spectral properties of the underlying integral operator. Consequently, most eigenvalues of the squared BEM coefficient matrix, i.e. the collocation-discretised version of the operator, cluster at a few points in the complex plane. When these clustering points are closely packed, the resulting linear system is well-conditioned and can be solved efficiently using the generalised minimal residual method with only a few iterations. However, when multiple materials with significantly different material constants are involved, some eigenvalues become separated, deteriorating the conditioning. To address this, we propose an enhanced Calderon-preconditioned BM-BEM with two strategies. First, we apply a preconditioning scheme inspired by the point Jacobi method. Second, we tune the Burton-Miller parameters to minimise the condition number of the coefficient matrix. Both strategies leverage a newly derived analytical expression for the eigenvalue clustering points of the relevant operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, combining both strategies, is particularly effective for solving scattering problems involving composite penetrable materials with high contrast in material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic materials exhibit anisotropy, saturation, and hysteresis. We here study the incorporation of an incremental vector hysteresis model representing such complex behavior into nonlinear magnetic field problems both, from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. We show that the hysteresis operators, relating magnetic fields and fluxes at every material point, are strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous. This allows to ensure well-posedness of the corresponding magnetic field problems and appropriate finite element discretizations thereof. We further show that the hysteresis operators are semi-smooth, derive a candidate for their generalized Jacobians, and establish global linear and local superlinear convergence of a the semi-smooth Newton method with line search applied to the iterative solution of the discretized nonlinear field problems. The results are proven in detail for a hysteresis model involving a single pinning force and the scalar potential formulation of magnetostatics. The extension to multiple pinning forces and the vector potential formulation is possible and briefly outlined. The theoretical results are further illustrated by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Maximum volume coordinates for Grassmann interpolation: Lagrange, Hermite, and errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to Riemannian interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. Instead of relying on the Riemannian normal coordinates, i.e. the Riemannian exponential and logarithm maps, we approach the interpolation problem with an alternative set of local coordinates and corresponding parameterizations. A special property of these coordinates is that their calculation does not require any matrix decompositions. This is a numerical advantage over Riemann normal coordinates and many other retractions on the Grassmann manifold, especially when derivative data are to be treated. To estimate the interpolation error, we examine the conditioning of these mappings and state explicit bounds. It turns out that the parameterizations are well-conditioned, but the coordinate mappings are generally not. As a remedy, we introduce maximum-volume coordinates that are based on a search for subblocks of column-orthogonal matrices of large absolute determinant. We show that the order of magnitude of the asymptotic interpolation error on $\Gr(n,p)$ is the same as in the Euclidean space. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first is an academic one, where we interpolate a parametric orthogonal projector $QQ^T$, where the $Q$--factor stems from a parametric compact QR--decomposition. The second experiment is in the context of parametric model reduction of dynamical systems, where we interpolate reduced subspaces that are obtained by proper orthogonal decomposition.</description>

      <title>A Budgeted Multi-Level Monte Carlo Method for Full Field Estimates of Multi-PDE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-performance budgeted multi-level Monte Carlo method for estimates on the entire spatial domain of multi-PDE problems with random input data. The method is designed to operate optimally within memory and CPU-time constraints and eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the problem's regularity and the algorithm's potential memory demand. To achieve this, we build on the budgeted multi-level Monte Carlo framework and enhance it with a sparse multi-index update algorithm operating on a dynamically assembled parallel data structure to enable estimates of the full field solution. We demonstrate numerically and provide mathematical proof that this update algorithm allows computing the full spatial domain estimates at the same CPU-time cost as a single quantity of interest, and that the maximum memory usage is similar to the memory demands of the deterministic formulation of the problem despite solving the stochastic formulation in parallel. We apply the method to a sequence of interlinked PDE problems, ranging from a stochastic partial differential equation for sampling random fields that serve as the diffusion coefficient in an elliptic subsurface flow problem, to a hyperbolic PDE describing mass transport in the resulting flux field.</description>

      <title>Multicontinuum splitting schemes for multiscale wave problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose multicontinuum splitting schemes for the wave equation with a high-contrast coefficient, extending our previous research on multiscale flow problems. The proposed approach consists of two main parts: decomposing the solution space into distinct components, and designing tailored time discretization schemes to enhance computational efficiency. To achieve the decomposition, we employ a multicontinuum homogenization method to introduce physically meaningful macroscopic variables and to separate fast and slow dynamics, effectively isolating contrast effects in high-contrast cases. This decomposition enables the design of schemes where the fast-dynamics (contrast-dependent) component is treated implicitly, while the slow-dynamics (contrast-independent) component is handled explicitly. The idea of discrete energy conservation is applied to derive the stability conditions, which are contrast-independent with appropriately chosen continua. We further discuss strategies for optimizing the space decomposition. These include a Rayleigh quotient problem involving tensors, and an alternative generalized eigenvalue decomposition to reduce computational effort. Finally, various numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Encodings of Polynomial Chaos Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the expressive power of quantum circuits in approximating high-dimensional, real-valued functions. We focus on countably-parametric holomorphic maps $u:U\to \mathbb{R}$, where the parameter domain is $U=[-1,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$. We establish dimension-independent quantum circuit approximation rates via the best $n$-term truncations of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions of these parametric maps, demonstrating that these rates depend solely on the summability exponent of the gPC expansion coefficients. The key to our findings is based on the fact that so-called ``$(\bsb,\epsilon)$-holomorphic'' functions, where $\bsb\in (0,1]^\mathbb N \cap \ell^p(\mathbb N)$ for some $p\in(0,1)$, permit structured and sparse gPC expansions. Then, $n$-term truncated gPC expansions are known to admit approximation rates of order $ n^{-1/p + 1/2}$ in the $L^2$ norm and of order $ n^{-1/p + 1}$ in the $L^\infty$ norm. We show the existence of parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) encodings of these $n$-term truncated gPC expansions, and bound PQC depth and width via (i) tensorization of univariate PQCs that encode \Tsch-polynomials in $[-1,1]$ and (ii) linear combination of unitaries (LCU) to build PQC emulations of $n$-term truncated gPC expansions. The results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the use of quantum algorithms in high-dimensional function approximation. As countably-parametric holomorphic maps naturally arise in parametric PDE models and uncertainty quantification (UQ), our results have implications for quantum-enhanced algorithms for a wide range of maps in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation is a widely used quantum master equation to model the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems whose states are described by density matrices. This equation is also a fundamental building block to design optimal control functions. In this paper we develop full- and low-rank exponential midpoint integrators for solving both the forward and adjoint Lindblad equations. These schemes are applicable to optimize-then-discretize approaches for optimal control of open quantum systems. We show that the proposed schemes preserve positivity and trace unconditionally. Furthermore, convergence of these numerical schemes is proved theoretically and verified numerically.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction techniques for inverse Sturm-Liouville problems with complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is considered, including the two-spectrum inverse problem, the problem of recovering the potential from the Weyl function, as well as the recovery from the spectral function. In all cases the potential in the Sturm-Liouville equation is assumed to be complex valued. A unified approach for the approximate solution of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is developed, based on Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions and their derivatives. Unlike most existing approaches, it allows one to recover not only the complex-valued potential but also the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Efficient accuracy control is implemented. The numerical method is direct. It involves only solving linear systems of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the NSBF representations, while eventually the knowledge only of the first NSBF coefficients leads to the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several test examples.</description>

      <title>Deformable registration and generative modelling of aortic anatomies by auto-decoders and neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces AD-SVFD, a deep learning model for the deformable registration of vascular shapes to a pre-defined reference and for the generation of synthetic anatomies. AD-SVFD operates by representing each geometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as solutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are expressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are optimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference point clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse transformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure, that enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight sharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code that acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the network parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are fine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the use of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new anatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and applying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry. Numerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the high-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations at competitive computational costs.</description>

      <title>Tight Convergence Rates in Gradient Mapping for the Difference-of-Convex Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new theoretical convergence guarantees for the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), where the second function is allowed to be weakly-convex, measuring progress via composite gradient mapping. Based on a tight analysis of two iterations of DCA, we identify six parameter regimes leading to sublinear convergence rates toward critical points and establish those rates by proving adapted descent lemmas. We recover existing rates for the standard difference-of-convex decompositions of nonconvex-nonconcave functions, while for all other curvature settings our results are new, complementing recently obtained rates on the gradient residual. Three of our sublinear rates are tight for any number of DCA iterations, while for the other three regimes we conjecture exact rates, using insights from the tight analysis of gradient descent and numerical validation using the performance estimation methodology. Finally, we show how the equivalence between proximal gradient descent (PGD) and DCA allows the derivation of exact PGD rates for any constant stepsize.</description>

      <title>An adaptive data sampling strategy for stabilizing dynamical systems via controller inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of Alternating Projections (AP) is a fundamental iterative technique with applications to problems in machine learning, optimization and signal processing. Examples include the Gauss-Seidel algorithm which is used to solve large-scale regression problems and the Kaczmarz and projections onto convex sets (POCS) algorithms that are fundamental to iterative reconstruction. Progress has been made with regards to the questions of efficiency and rate of convergence in the randomized setting of the AP method. Here, we extend these results with volume sampling to block (batch) sizes greater than 1 and provide explicit formulas that relate the convergence rate bounds to the spectrum of the underlying system. These results, together with a trace formula and associated volume sampling, prove that convergence rates monotonically improve with larger block sizes, a feature that can not be guaranteed in general with uniform sampling (e.g., in SGD).</description>

      <title>Addressing the checkerboard problem in an Eulerian meshless method for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we look at the pressure checkerboard problem that arises in an Eulerian meshless method that solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the generalized finite difference method (GFDM). Although, the checkerboard problem has been dealt with extensively in mesh-based methods, the literature in connection with meshless methods is comparatively scarce. In this paper, we explore the occurrence of the checkerboard problem in a meshless method. A few unsuccessful attempts to resolve the checkerboard problem are reported. The successful fix for the problem entails an algorithm that adapts the point cloud by adding points in the regions of pressure oscillations. The algorithm uses an error indicator that detects the presence of the checkerboard oscillations in the solution. The algorithm minimizes the computational effort since it ensures the use of additional points only in regions of concern, as directed by the error indicator, in contrast to an approach of using a highly refined set of points throughout the domain. It also requires no a priori estimates of the regions where the oscillations occur and integrates conveniently in the framework of the meshless method since no re-meshing strategies are involved. The results are compared with literature and a good match is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive refined generalization bounds for the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). For the DRM, we focus on two prototype elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs): Poisson equation and static Schr\"odinger equation on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube with the Neumann boundary condition. Furthermore, sharper generalization bounds are derived based on the localization techniques under the assumptions that the exact solutions of the PDEs lie in the Barron spaces or the general Sobolev spaces. For the PINNs, we investigate the general linear second order elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary condition using the local Rademacher complexity in the multi-task learning setting. Finally, we discuss the generalization error in the setting of over-parameterization when solutions of PDEs belong to Barron space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the statistics of the state of a dynamical system, from partial and noisy observations, is both mathematically challenging and finds wide application. Furthermore, the applications are of great societal importance, including problems such as probabilistic weather forecasting and prediction of epidemics. Particle filters provide a well-founded approach to the problem, leading to provably accurate approximations of the statistics. However these methods perform poorly in high dimensions. In 1994 the idea of ensemble Kalman filtering was introduced by Evensen, leading to a methodology that has been widely adopted in the geophysical sciences and also finds application to quite general inverse problems. However, ensemble Kalman filters have defied rigorous analysis of their statistical accuracy, except in the linear Gaussian setting. In this article we describe recent work which takes first steps to analyze the statistical accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters beyond the linear Gaussian setting. The subject is inherently technical, as it involves the evolution of probability measures according to a nonlinear and nonautonomous dynamical system; and the approximation of this evolution. It can nonetheless be presented in a fairly accessible fashion, understandable with basic knowledge of dynamical systems, numerical analysis and probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Godunov-type finite volume methods for seismic wave propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational complexity of simulating seismic waves demands continual exploration of more efficient numerical methods. While Finite Volume methods are widely acclaimed for tackling general nonlinear hyperbolic (wave) problems, their application in realistic seismic wave simulation remains uncommon, with rare investigations in the literature. Furthermore, seismic wavefields are influenced by sharp subsurface interfaces frequently encountered in realistic models, which could, in principle, be adequately solved with Finite Volume methods. In this study, we delved into two Finite Volume (FV) methods to assess their efficacy and competitiveness in seismic wave simulations, compared to traditional Finite Difference schemes. We investigated Gudunov-type FV methods: an upwind method called wave propagation algorithm (WPA), and a Central-Upwind type method (CUp). Our numerical analysis uncovered that these finite volume methods could provide less dispersion (albeit increased dissipation) compared to finite differences for seismic problems characterized by velocity profiles with abrupt transitions in the velocity. However, when applied to more realistic seismic models, finite volume methods yielded unfavorable outcomes compared to finite difference methods, the latter offering lower computational costs and higher accuracy. This highlights that despite the potential advantages of finite volume methods, such as their conservative nature and aptitude for accurately capturing shock waves in specific contexts, our results indicate that they are only advantageous for seismic simulations when unrealistic abrupt transitions are present in the velocity models in the velocity models.</description>

      <title>Efficient and scalable atmospheric dynamics simulations using non-conforming meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the massively parallel performance of a $h$-adaptive solver for atmosphere dynamics that allows for non-conforming mesh refinement. The numerical method is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization, highly scalable thanks to its data locality properties, and on a second order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) method for time discretization, particularly well suited for low Mach number flows. Simulations with non-conforming meshes for flows over orography can increase the accuracy of the local flow description without affecting the larger scales, which can be solved on coarser meshes. We show that the local refining procedure has no significant impact on the parallel performance and, therefore, both efficiency and scalability can be achieved in this framework.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Levenberg-Marquardt method with Singular Scaling for nonzero residue nonlinear least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a Levenberg-Marquardt method with Singular Scaling matrix, called LMMSS, was proposed and successfully applied in parameter estimation in heat conduction problems, where the choice of suitable singular scaling matrix resulted in better quality approximate solutions than those of the classical Levenberg-Marquardt. In this paper, we study convergence properties of LMMSS when applied to nonzero residual nonlinear least-squares problems. We show that the local convergence of the iterates depends both on the control of the gradient linearization error and on a suitable choice of the regularization parameter. Incidentally, we show that the rate of convergence is dictated by a measure of nonlinearity and residual size, so that if such a measure goes to zero quickly enough, the convergence can be superlinear, otherwise, in general, we show that not even linear convergence can be expected if such a measure is not small enough. Additionally, we propose a globalized version of the method and prove that any limit point of the generated sequence is stationary for the least-squares function. Some examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Coupled Domain Decomposition Method for Multiphase and Multicomponent Porous Media Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of large-scale multiphase and multicomponent flow in porous media is a significant field of interest in the petroleum industry. The fully implicit approach is favored in reservoir simulation due to its numerical stability and relaxed constraints on time-step sizes. However, this method requires solving a large nonlinear system at each time step, making the development of efficient and convergent numerical methods crucial for accelerating the nonlinear solvers. In this paper, we present an adaptively coupled subdomain framework based on the domain decomposition method. The solution methods developed within this framework effectively handle strong nonlinearities in global problems by addressing subproblems in the coupled regions. Furthermore, we propose several adaptive coupling strategies and develop a method for leveraging initial guesses to accelerate the solution of nonlinear problems, thereby improving the convergence and parallel performance of nonlinear solvers. A series of numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Additionally, by utilizing tens of thousands of processors, we demonstrate the scalability of this approach through a large-scale reservoir simulation with over 2 billion degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Assimilation via Score-based Sequential Langevin Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents score-based sequential Langevin sampling (SSLS), a novel approach to nonlinear data assimilation within a recursive Bayesian filtering framework. The proposed method decomposes the assimilation process into alternating prediction and update steps, leveraging dynamic models for state prediction while incorporating observational data through score-based Langevin Monte Carlo during updates. To address challenges in posterior sampling, we introduce an annealing strategy within the update mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for SSLS convergence in total variation (TV) distance under certain conditions, providing insights into error behavior with respect to key hyper-parameters. Our numerical experiments across challenging scenarios -- including high-dimensional systems, strong nonlinearity, and sparse observations -- demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, SSLS effectively quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimated states, making it particularly valuable for the error calibration.</description>

      <title>A fast food-freezing temperature estimation framework using optimally located sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents and assesses a framework for estimating temperature fields in real time for food-freezing applications, significantly reducing computational load while ensuring accurate temperature monitoring, which represents a promising technological tool for optimizing and controlling food engineering processes. The strategy is based on (i) a mathematical model of a convection-dominated problem coupling thermal convection and turbulence, and (ii) a least-squares approach for solving the inverse data assimilation problem, regularized by projecting the governing dynamics onto a reduced-order model (ROM). The unsteady freezing process considers a salmon slice in a freezer cabinet, modeled with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. The forward problem is approximated using a third-order WENO finite volume solver, including an optimized second-order backward scheme for time discretization. We employ our data assimilation framework to reconstruct the temperature field based on a limited number of sensors and to estimate temperature distributions within frozen food. Sensor placement is optimized using a novel greedy algorithm, which maximizes the observability of the reduced-order dynamics for a fixed set of sensors. The proposed approach allows efficient extrapolation from external sensor measurements to the internal temperature of the food under realistic turbulent flow conditions, which is crucial for maintaining food quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers a time domain inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem due to passive data. Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data in passive imaging to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data in passive imaging. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Computing accurate eigenvalues using a mixed-precision Jacobi algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rounding error analysis of a mixed-precision preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, which uses low precision to compute the preconditioner, applies it at high precision (amounting to two matrix-matrix multiplications) and solves the eigenproblem using the Jacobi algorithm at working precision. Our analysis yields meaningfully smaller relative forward error bounds for the computed eigenvalues compared with those of the Jacobi algorithm. We further prove that, after preconditioning, if the off-diagonal entries of the preconditioned matrix are sufficiently small relative to its smallest diagonal entry, the relative forward error bound is independent of the condition number of the original matrix. We present two constructions for the preconditioner that exploit low precision, along with their error analyses. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and compare the relative forward error of the proposed algorithm with the Jacobi algorithm, a preconditioned Jacobi algorithm, and MATLAB's $\texttt{eig}$ function. Timings using Julia suggest that the dominant cost of obtaining this level of accuracy comes from the high precision matrix-matrix multiplies; if support in software or hardware for this were improved then this would become a negligible cost.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an adaptive finite element scheme for the efficient approximation of a (large) collection of eigenpairs of selfadjoint elliptic operators in which the adaptive refinement is driven by the solution of a single source problem -- the so-called landscape problem for the operator -- instead of refining based on the computed eigenpairs. Some theoretical justification for the approach is provided, and extensive empirical results indicate that it can provide an attractive alternative to standard adaptive schemes, particularly in the hp-adaptive environment.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>

Abstract: As part of the development of a Poisson solver for the spectral element discretization used in the GeoFluid Object Workbench (GeoFLOW) code, we propose a solver for the linear system arising from a Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto global spectral method. We precondition using a p-multigrid {\gamma}-cycle with highly-vectorizable smoothers, that we refer to as line smoothers. Our smoothers are restrictions of spectral and finite element discretizations to low-order one-dimensional problems along lines, that are solved by a reformulation of cyclic reduction as a direct multigrid method. We illustrate our method with numerical experiments showing the apparent boundedness of the iteration count for a fixed residual reduction over a range of moderately deformed domains, right hand sides and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Fast Direct Solver for Boundary Integral Equations Using Quadrature By Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a hierarchical direct solver for linear systems arising from the discretization of boundary integral equations using the Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) method. Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</description>

      <title>Toward optimal-scaling DFT: stochastic Hartree theory in the thermodynamic and complete basis set limits at arbitrary temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first mathematical analysis of stochastic density functional theory (DFT) in the context of the Hartree approximation. We motivate our analysis via the notion of nearly-optimal or $\tilde{O}(n)$ scaling with respect to the number $n$ of computational degrees of freedom, independent of the number of electrons, in both the thermodynamic and complete basis set limits. Indeed, the promise of such scaling is the primary motivation for stochastic DFT relative to conventional orbital-based approaches, as well as deterministic orbital-free alternatives. We highlight three key targets for mathematical attention, which are synthesized in our algorithm and analysis. First, we identify a particular stochastic estimator for the Hartree potential whose sample complexity is essentially independent of the discretization size. Second, we reformulate the self-consistent field iteration as a stochastic mirror descent method where the Fermi-Dirac entropy plays the role of the Bregman potential, and we prove a nearly discretization-independent bound on the number of iterations needed to reach fixed accuracy. Third, motivated by the estimator, we introduce a novel pole expansion scheme for the square-root Fermi-Dirac operator, preserving $\tilde{O}(n)$ cost per mirror descent iteration even in the complete basis set limit. Combining these ingredients, we establish nearly-optimal scaling in both limits of interest under reasonable assumptions on the basis sets chosen for discretization. Extensive numerical experiments on problems with as many as $10^{6}$ degrees of freedom validate our algorithm and support the theory of nearly-optimal scaling.</description>

Unlike standard approximation tasks where sampling points can be freely queried, physical systems with complex energy landscapes such as molecular dynamics (MD) do not have direct access to arbitrary sampling regions due to the physical constraints and energy barriers; the surrogate construction further relies on the dynamical exploration of phase space, posing a significant numerical challenge. We formulate the problem as a minimax optimization that jointly adapts both the surrogate approximation and residual-enhanced sampling. The construction of free energy surfaces (FESs) for high-dimensional collective variables (CVs) of MD systems is used as a motivating example to illustrate the essential idea. Specifically, the maximization step establishes a stochastic interacting particle system to impose adaptive sampling through both exploitation of a Laplace approximation of the max-residual region and exploration of uncharted phase space via temperature control. The minimization step updates the FES surrogate with the new sample set. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach for biomolecular systems with up to 30 CVs. While we focus on the FES construction, the developed framework is general for efficient surrogate construction for complex systems with high-dimensional energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic structure of the adjoint Euler equations and the analytic adjoint solution of supersonic inviscid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristic structure of the two-dimensional adjoint Euler equations is examined. The behavior is similar to that of the original Euler equations, but with the information travelling in the opposite direction. The compatibility conditions obeyed by the adjoint variables along characteristic lines are derived. It is also shown that adjoint variables can have discontinuities across characteristics and the corresponding jump conditions are obtained. It is shown how this information can be used to obtain exact predictions for the adjoint variables, particularly for supersonic flows. The approach is illustrated by the analysis of supersonic flow past a double wedge airfoil, for which an analytic adjoint solution is obtained in the near-wall region. The solution is zero downstream of the airfoil and piecewise constant around it except across the expansion fan, where the adjoint variables change smoothly while remaining constant along each Mach wave within the fan.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-scaled strong convergence and stability of stochastic theta method for time-changed stochastic differential equations with local Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first $\alpha$-parameterized framework for solving time-changed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), explicitly linking convergence rates and key driving parameter of the underlying stochastic processes. Theoretically, we derive exact moment estimates and exponential moment estimate of inverse $\alpha$-stable subordinator $E$ using Mittag-Leffler functions. The stochastic theta (ST) method is investigated for a class of SDEs driven by a time-changed Brownian motion, whose coefficients are time-space-dependent and satisfy the local Lipschitz condition. We prove that the convergence order dynamically responds to the stability index $\alpha$ of stable subordinator $D$, filling a critical gap in traditional methods that treat these factors independently. We also investigate the criteria of asympotical mean square stability of the ST method. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>
