      <title>On Naturally and Weakly Mal'tsev Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a hierarchy of notions in categorical algebra: Mal'tsev categories (where every reflexive relation is symmetric); naturally Mal'tsev categories (where every reflexive graph underlies a unique internal groupoid structure, also known as the Lawvere Condition); and weakly Mal'tsev categories (defined via the joint epimorphicity of local product injections). While varying in generality and historical prominence, these notions can be uniformly described using suitable classes of spans and a new structural condition, called the Kite Condition.
  To this end, we reintroduce the notion of a multiplicative directed kite, an internal categorical structure that generalizes both internal categories and internal pregroupoids. We also define and study the concept of a weakly Mal'tsev object, uncovering new structural insights and examples.
  While several of the results we present are known in the context of categories with finite limits, we show that they remain valid - and in fact gain clarity - in the broader setting of categories admitting only pullbacks of split epimorphisms along split epimorphisms.</description>

      <title>Modeling GRNs with a Probabilistic Categorical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Replacing functors with enriched ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe simple criteria under which a given functor is naturally equivalent to an enriched one. We do this for several bases of enrichment, namely (pointed) simplicial sets, (pointed) topological spaces and orthogonal spectra. We also describe a few corollaries, such as a new proof of a result of Lurie on Dwyer-Kan localizations.</description>

      <title>Reflecting compact $T_1$-spaces into bounded distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a contravariant reflection of the compact $T_1$-spaces with arrows given by closed continuous functions into the category of bounded distributive lattices with arrows given by closed subfit morphisms. This reflection extends both Stone duality and Isbell's duality between frames and sober spaces for those compact $T_1$-spaces that fall within each of these dualities, that is, respectively, zero-dimensional compact Hausdorff spaces, and compact sober $T_1$-spaces. On the topological side, we allow all compact $T_1$-spaces rather than just sober ones and we identify points in these with minimal prime filters on some base. On the lattice side, the shift goes from the notion of frame homomorphism to that of closed subfit morphism between bounded distributive lattices (closed subfit morphisms are defined by a natural and first order expressible constraint). The reflection becomes a duality when one restricts on the algebraic side to the complete and compact subfit lattices (i.e. compact subfit frames). Furthermore, restricting our duality on the topological side to the subcategory of compact $T_2$-spaces with all continuous maps, we obtain a duality for these with the category of complete, compact and normal lattices, thus recovering a classical result of Cornish. We also relate our adjunction to the duality introduced by Maruyama between $T_1$-spaces with continuous maps and a category having as objects a particular type of subfit frames and as arrows a certain type of morphism, of which we give an alternative and explicit algebraic characterization.</description>
