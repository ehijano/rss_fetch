      <title>Balancing Selection Efficiency and Social Costs in Selective Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective contests can impair participants' overall welfare in overcompetitive environments, such as school admissions. This paper models the situation as an optimal contest design problem with binary actions, treating effort costs as societal costs incurred to achieve a desired level of selectivity. We provide a characterization for the feasible set of selection efficiency and societal cost in selective contests by establishing their relationship with feasible equilibrium strategies. We find that selection efficiency and contestants' welfare are complementary, i.e. it is almost impossible to improve one without sacrificing the other. We derive the optimal equilibrium outcome given the feasible set and characterize the corresponding optimal contest design. Our analysis demonstrates that it is always optimal for a contest designer who is sufficiently concerned with societal cost to intentionally introduce randomness into the contest. Furthermore, we show that the designer can optimize any linear payoff function by adjusting a single parameter related to the intensity of randomness, without altering the specific structure of the contest.</description>

      <title>A General Equilibrium Study of Venture Capitalists' Effort on Entrepreneurship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new general equilibrium model that explains stylized facts about venture capitalists' impact on their portfolio firms. Venture capitalists can help increase firms' productivity, yet they face increasing entry costs to enter. I characterize steady state effort choice, entry threshold, and mass of venture capitalists, and show how they are affected by change in upfront investment, interest rate, and entry costs. The key contribution is that public policy to stimulate startups by subsidizing upfront investments or reducing interest cost have limited success if not accompanied by an increasing supply of experts who can improve business ideas.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith's Labor Theory of Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adam Smith's inquiry into the emergence and stability of the self-organization of the division of labor in commodity production and exchange is considered using statistical equilibrium methods from statistical physics. We develop a statistical equilibrium model of the distribution of independent direct producers in a hub-and-spoke framework that predicts both the center of gravity of producers across lines of production as well as the endogenous fluctuations between lines of production that arise from Smith's concept of "perfect liberty". The ergodic distribution of producers implies a long-run balancing of "advantages to disadvantages" across lines of employment and gravitation of market prices around Smith's natural prices.</description>

      <title>Attention Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an Attention Overload Model that captures the idea that alternatives compete for the decision maker's attention, and hence the attention that each alternative receives decreases as the choice problem becomes larger. Using this nonparametric restriction on the random attention formation, we show that a fruitful revealed preference theory can be developed and provide testable implications on the observed choice behavior that can be used to (point or partially) identify the decision maker's preference and attention frequency. We then enhance our attention overload model to accommodate heterogeneous preferences. Due to the nonparametric nature of our identifying assumption, we must discipline the amount of heterogeneity in the choice model: we propose the idea of List-based Attention Overload, where alternatives are presented to the decision makers as a list that correlates with both heterogeneous preferences and random attention. We show that preference and attention frequencies are (point or partially) identifiable under nonparametric assumptions on the list and attention formation mechanisms, even when the true underlying list is unknown to the researcher. Building on our identification results, for both preference and attention frequencies, we develop econometric methods for estimation and inference that are valid in settings with a large number of alternatives and choice problems, a distinctive feature of the economic environment we consider. We provide a software package in R implementing our empirical methods, and illustrate them in a simulation study.</description>
