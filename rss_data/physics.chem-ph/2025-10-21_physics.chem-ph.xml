      <title>System-Bath Modeling in Vibrational Spectroscopy via Molecular Dynamics: A Machine Learning Framework for Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular vibrations in solutions, especially OH stretching and bending in water, drive ultrafast energy relaxation and dephasing in chemical and biological systems. We present a machine learning approach for constructing system-bath models of intramolecular vibrations in solution, compatible with quantum simulations via the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). Using classical molecular dynamics trajectories generated with a force field specifically developed for quantum molecular dynamics, the model captures anharmonic mode coupling and non-Markovian dissipation through spectral distribution functions (SDFs). These features, in turn, enable quantum mechanical treatment of ultrafast energy relaxation, vibrational dephasing, and thermal excitation within the HEOM framework.. The trained model yields physically interpretable parameters, validated against infrared spectra. Notably, combining Brownian oscillator and Drude SDFs -- representing inter- and intramolecular vibrational modes -- significantly improves learning performance and supports rigorous simulation of nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Descriptions of Open Systems of Complex Chemical Reactions with Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general theory of a complex system of nonlinear chemical reactions is a primary language of chemistry that includes chemical engineering and cellular biochemistry. Its significance as an analytical framework, however, has not been fully appreciated outside the community of physical chemists. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the kinetics and Gibbsian thermodynamics of chemical reactions in a spatially homogeneous aqueous solution with a multiscale perspective on complex systems. From the microscopic level of single reaction events which are purely stochastic in continuous time, one at a time among a set of molecules, to the macroscopic chemical reaction systems in bulk in terms of deterministic rate equations, the mathematical descriptions of kinetic models for chemical reactions at different levels are presented in detail, with rigorous mathematical justifications presented. In parallel with the kinetics of chemical reactions, the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems and the stochastic thermodynamics along reactions trajectories are reviewed thoroughly. As a novel feature, the mathematical theory of large deviations is shown to play a pivotal role in the thermodynamics of chemical reactions in equilibrium and in irreversible processes. This review is expected to stimulate interests in and help defining multiscale phenomena and nonequilibrium thermodynamics in many research fields on population dynamics of interacting species using chemical reactions as an analytic paradigm.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Memristive Characteristics by Dynamic Nanoprecipitation inside Conical Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluidic memristors have demonstrated great potential for neuromorphic system applications with the advantages of low energy consumption and excellent biocompatibility. Here, an effective way is developed to regulate the memristive behavior of conical nanopores by leveraging the reversible formation and dissolution of nanoprecipitates induced by ion enrichment and depletion in nanopores under opposite voltages. Through the interplay between precipitation dynamics at the pore tip and the ion enrichment/depletion inside the nanopore, conical nanopores exhibit pronounced current hysteresis loops in the presence of CaHPO4, a slightly soluble inorganic salt. The memristive characteristics are found to be strongly dependent on the concentration of CaHPO4, besides the applied voltage amplitude and scan rate. Under the stimulation of pulse voltages, ionic current demonstrates stable learning and forgetting processes with robust switching stability and effective reset capability, which is similar to the short-term plasticity characteristics of biological synapses. Our research may provide a straightforward and tunable approach for the design of nanofluidic memristors.</description>

      <title>Ionic current rectification under concentration gradients and its application in evaluating surface charge properties of micropores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic current rectification (ICR) induced by electroosmotic flow (EOF) under concentration gradients can find many applications in micro/nanofluidic sensing and ionic circuits. Here, we focused on the cases with micropores of moderate length-diameter ratios, through experimental research and systematical simulations, the EOF-induced ICR was found to exhibit voltage-dependent ratios. In the considered cases with a weak EOF or strong ionic diffusion, a large deviation appears between the ion concentration inside the micropore and the bulk value, which fails the prediction by solution conductivity gradients. Based on our simulation results, effective equations were developed for the theoretical description of ion concentration distributions along the micropore axis under coupled concentration gradient and electric field. With the predicted ion distributions inside micropores, the ICR ratio can be conveniently calculated with the derived electrical resistance of the microfluidic system, which applies to micropores of 200 to 1000 nm in diameter. Because the surface charge density is the only unknown input parameter, our developed equations can be used to evaluate the surface charge density of micropores with the measured EOF-induced ICR ratio under concentration gradients.</description>

      <title>Harnessing dressed time-dependent density functional theory for the non-perturbative regime: Electron dynamics with double excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has been made in capturing spectral features of electronic states of double-excitation character in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) through a frequency-dependent kernel. While it might appear that this development is limited to the perturbative regime, we show that when used within response-reformulated TDDFT, it accurately captures strong-field dynamics involving states of double-excitation character. More generally, this demonstrates how RR-TDDFT enables exchange-correlation functional developments in the response regime, which have so far been more successful than those in the non-linear regime, to be exploited for non-perturbative dynamics, thus significantly broadening their range of applications.</description>

      <title>Local Proton Disorder Induced Intermolecular H-H Coupling in Ionization of Dense Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under cold compression, hydrogen bonding was considered to dominate intermolecular interaction during the ionization of ammonia. Here, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence of intermolecular HH coupling in dense ammonia. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) reveal an increasing degree of proton disorder in ammonia with increasing pressure, which promotes intermolecular H-H coupling. At pressure below the ionization phase transition pressure (135 GPa), intermolecular HH coupling gives rise to a unique dissociation pathway in ammonia. Sporadic molecular hydrogen was observed without laser heating, accompanied by the absence of molecular nitrogen. At pressure above 135 GPa, intermolecular HH coupling serves as an intermediate state in the ionization of ammonia. Two fingerprint Raman modes previously assigned to the ionic phase disappear upon further compression or heating. Together with proton transfer based on hydrogen bond, a dual path mechanism exists in the ionization of ammonia. Our results demonstrate a case of hydrides phase transition pathway that occurs independently of hydrogen bonding under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Enhanced accumulation of bitumen residue in a highly concentrated tailings flow by microbubbles from in-situ catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive volume of oil sands tailings has been one of the most challenging environmental issues. In this work, we experimentally explore a simple and effective approach to bitumen residue separation from a highly concentrated slurry flow of the artificial oil sands tailings. By utilizing microbubbles from in-situ catalytic decomposition of H2O2 at low concentrations, bitumen aggregation is enhanced on the top part of the hydrotransport pipeline. The microscopic image analysis revealed the in-situ formation of microbubbles and confirmed that magnetic particles present in the slurries contributed to the fast release of the gas products and bubble formation from hydrogen peroxide decomposition. A high-speed camera was applied to capture images of the tailings flow in the pipeline through a transparent view window. A large number of tiny bubbles were identified post to the injection of H2O2 to the slurry flow. More than 70 % bitumen could be recovered from a lab-scale pipeline loop within 30 mins after injection. The bitumen recovery efficiency from the collected froth was quantitatively compared under seven conditions with varied dosages, the concentration of H2O2, and the amount of magnetic solids in the slurries. Our results confirmed that the total dosage of H2O2 is the dominant factor in in-situ microbubble formation for enhanced bitumen aggregation in the flow. Importantly, microbubbles were generated rapidly in the real mature fine tailings. The results from our study provide insights into the preferential distribution of oil residue in the flow during hydrotransport without the requirement for an additional device. Removal of oily residues from concentrated slurries may bring economical and environmental advantages.</description>

      <title>Coherent and Dynamic Small Polaron Delocalization in CuFeO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration [M. Tao, Phys. Rev. E 94, 043303 (2016)] for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Ion transport through differently charged nanoporous membranes: from a single nanopore to multi-nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous membranes, leveraging their high-throughput characteristics, have been widely applied in fields such as molecular separation and energy conversion. Due to interpore interactions, besides the applied voltage and solution environment, the ion transport properties in porous membranes are influenced by the pore number and spacing. Here, to understand and control the transport properties of nanopore arrays, we systematically investigate the ion transport characteristics through membranes with different charge properties, pore numbers, and interpore distances. Using numerical simulations, we analyzed local ionic concentrations and electric potential in nanopore arrays containing nanopores with uniformly charged walls as well as unipolar diodes i.e., pores containing a junction between a charged zone and a neutral zone, and showed significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) for all studied cases. As the number of pores increased and the interpore spacing decreased, the enhanced interpore interactions through ICP led to a greater deviation of the total ionic current from the linear superposition of single-pore currents. Conversely, in bipolar nanopores whose walls contain a junction between positively and negatively charged zones ICP becomes negligible, and interpore interactions are substantially reduced. Furthermore, for membranes with various charge properties, the total current through nanopore arrays presents different quantitative dependence on the pore number under varying pore spacings. Our findings clarify the mechanism of interpore interactions in modulating ion transport through porous membranes, providing critical insights for designing nanofluidic devices based on nanopore arrays, such as nanopore-array sensors.</description>

      <title>LOCAL: A Graph-Based Active Learning Approach for Stability Analysis of DAC@NG Catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual atomic catalysts supported by nitrogen-doped graphene (DAC@NG) offer significant potential in catalytic applications by overcoming intrinsic limitations associated with single atomic catalysts. However, accurately determining their stability and atomic-scale configurations remains computationally challenging due to extensive structural variability. In this study, we present the LOCalization and Active Learning (LOCAL) framework, an innovative, scalable approach employing two graph convolutional network (GCN) models (POS2COHP and Graph2E) to predict stability energies directly from initial DAC@NG structures. Leveraging an extensive dataset of 611,648 DAC@NG structures, encompassing 38 metal elements, six distinct graphene quadra-vacancy patterns, and diverse carbon/nitrogen coordination environments, LOCAL achieved a remarkable validation mean absolute error of just 0.145 eV. Utilizing this framework, we systematically analyzed stability trends across various metal pairs, successfully generating phase diagrams for experimentally validated bimetallic systems (Co-Ni, Fe-Ni, Fe-Mn, and Ag-Ni). These results underscore LOCAL's capability for rapidly evaluating structural stability, significantly accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-performance catalysts. The developed dataset and LOCAL framework are publicly available, offering a valuable resource for future catalyst design and broader exploration of catalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical modulation of vibrational strong coupling in ReCl(CO)$_3$(2,2-bipyridine)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity, but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\'erot cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states that subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

Here we introduce the first theoretical model of electrochemical Ostwald ripening, capturing the competition between electroplating and surface-energy-driven redistribution and identifying it as the governing process behind morphology evolution in the non-dendritic regime. The framework explicitly incorporates SEI resistance, electrolyte conductivity, electrode wettability, and current density revealing the transition from 2D SEI-limited to 3D electrolyte-limited growth. The model yields analytical expressions for nucleus size, density and distribution that quantitatively reproduce independent experimental results and establishes a direct link between plating conditions, morphology, and Coulombic efficiency. By providing experimentally accessible relationships between key parameters and deposition outcomes, the framework enables predictive understanding of lithium plating and provides a broadly applicable basis for controlling electrodeposition morphology across diverse electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>

Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Equipartition and the temperature of maximum density of TIP4/2005 water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate TIP4P/2005 water in the temperature range of 257 K to 318 K with time-steps $\delta =$ 0.25, 0.50, 2.00, and 4.00 fs. The density-temperature behavior obtained using 0.25 or 0.50 fs are in excellent agreement with each other but differ from those obtained using time-steps that have been shown earlier to lead to a breakdown of equipartition. The temperature of maximum density (TMD) is 277.15 K with $\delta t = 0.25\;\mathrm{or}\; 0.50$ fs, but is shifted to progressively lower values for longer time-steps, a trend that holds for different thermostat/barostat combinations. Enhancing the water-water dispersion interaction, as has been recommended for simulating disordered proteins in TIP4P/2005, degrades the description of the liquid-vapor phase envelope. A key takeaway from this study is that using sufficiently short time-steps ($\leq 0.5$ fs) to preserve equipartition is essential for obtaining meaningful liquid water properties and for producing reliable data to parametrize biomolecular simulation models, as correct-ensemble sampling is fundamental to ensure reproducibility across codes and simulation alogrithms.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>
