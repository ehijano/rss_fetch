      <title>Literature Mining System for Nutraceutical Biosynthesis: From AI Framework to Biological Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of structured knowledge from scientific literature remains a major bottleneck in nutraceutical research, particularly when identifying microbial strains involved in compound biosynthesis. This study presents a domain-adapted system powered by large language models (LLMs) and guided by advanced prompt engineering techniques to automate the identification of nutraceutical-producing microbes from unstructured scientific text. By leveraging few-shot prompting and tailored query designs, the system demonstrates robust performance across multiple configurations, with DeepSeekV3 outperforming LLaMA2 in accuracy, especially when domain-specific strain information is included. A structured and validated dataset comprising 35 nutraceutical-strain associations was generated, spanning amino acids, fibers, phytochemicals, and vitamins. The results reveal significant microbial diversity across monoculture and co-culture systems, with dominant contributions from Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis, alongside emerging synthetic consortia. This AI-driven framework not only enhances the scalability and interpretability of literature mining but also provides actionable insights for microbial strain selection, synthetic biology design, and precision fermentation strategies in the production of high-value nutraceuticals.</description>

      <title>LiveProteinBench: A Contamination-Free Benchmark for Assessing Models' Specialized Capabilities in Protein Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to their remarkable performance on general knowledge QA, the true abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks demanding deep, specialized reasoning, such as in protein biology, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Current benchmarks suffer from critical deficiencies, such as data contamination due to outdated test sets, insufficient focus on essential protein-specific tasks, and a neglect of multimodal assessments. To resolve these issues, we introduce LiveProteinBench, a contamination-free, multimodal benchmark of 12 tasks for evaluating LLM performance on protein property and function prediction. Its central innovation lies in a test set composed exclusively of proteins validated after the start of 2025, guaranteeing that the data is novel to all tested models. We benchmarked a suite of prominent general-purpose LLMs and specialized biological LLMs using both unimodal and multimodal input schemes. Our results show that: 1) General-purpose proprietary large models demonstrate superior zero-shot performance when encountering new protein data, outperforming their open-source and domain-specific counterparts by over 20\% accuracy. 2) The effective use of multi-view structural information remains a significant challenge, as the inclusion of structural images often fails to provide a consistent benefit and can even degrade performance. This highlights the limitations of current models in effectively fusing information across different modalities. 3) Models' performance scales more directly with the computational cost during inference than with its parameter count, underscoring the critical role of Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities for protein-specific tasks. LiveProteinBench delineates the current performance frontiers for LLMs in bioinformatics and presents new challenges for the development of future multimodal foundation models for biology</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Spatially resolved survival modelling from routine histology crosslinked with molecular profiling reveals prognostic epithelial-immune axes in stage II/III colorectal cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routine histology contains rich prognostic information in stage II/III colorectal cancer, much of which is embedded in complex spatial tissue organisation. We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large independent validation showed superior prognostic performance compared with pTNM staging (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58). INSIGHT spatial risk maps recapitulated canonical prognostic histopathology and identified nuclear solidity and circularity as quantitative risk correlates. Integrating spatial risk with data-driven spatial transcriptomic signatures, spatial proteomics, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell references revealed an epithelium-immune risk manifold capturing epithelial dedifferentiation and fetal programs, myeloid-driven stromal states including $\mathrm{SPP1}^{+}$ macrophages and $\mathrm{LAMP3}^{+}$ dendritic cells, and adaptive immune dysfunction. This analysis exposed patient-specific epithelial heterogeneity, stratification within MSI-High tumours, and high-risk routes of CDX2/HNF4A loss and CEACAM5/6-associated proliferative programs, highlighting coordinated therapeutic vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Measuring the time-scale-dependent information flow between maternal and fetal heartbeats during the third trimester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow.</description>

      <title>An integrated quantitative single-objective light-sheet microscope for subcellular dynamics in embryos and cultured multicellular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging of subcellular processes in living embryos, stem-cell systems, and organoid models requires microscopy platforms that combine high spatial resolution, fast volumetric acquisition, long-term stability, and minimal phototoxicity. Single-objective light-sheet approaches based on oblique plane microscopy (OPM) are well suited for live imaging in standard sample geometries, but most existing implementations lack the optical calibration, timing precision, and end-to-end integration required for reproducible quantitative measurements. Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts. This work establishes OPM as a robust and quantitatively calibrated single-objective light-sheet platform for transcription imaging in complex living systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Architecture of Living Systems</title>

Abstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.
  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.</description>

      <title>The body is not there to compute: Comment on "Informational embodiment: Computational role of information structure in codes and robots" by Pitti et al</title>

Abstract: Applying the lens of computation and information has been instrumental in driving the technological progress of our civilization as well as in empowering our understanding of the world around us. The digital computer was and for many still is the leading metaphor for how our mind operates. Information theory (IT) has also been important in our understanding of how nervous systems encode and process information. The target article deploys information and computation to bodies: to understand why they have evolved in particular ways (animal bodies) and to design optimal bodies (robots). In this commentary, I argue that the main role of bodies is not to compute.</description>

      <title>QSAR-Guided Generative Framework for the Discovery of Synthetically Viable Odorants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fr\'echet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ....</description>

      <title>Mono- and Polyauxic Growth Kinetics: A Semi-Mechanistic Framework for Complex Biological Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic modeling of microbial growth is essential for the design, optimization, and scale-up of industrial bioprocesses. Classical empirical models often lack biologically interpretable parameters or fail to capture complex multiphasic (polyauxic) behaviors, while fully mechanistic models are impractical for systems involving complex substrates and mixed cultures. This study proposes a unified mathematical framework that reformulates the canonical Boltzmann and Gompertz equations into semi-mechanistic forms, explicitly defining the maximum specific reaction rate and lag phase duration. Polyauxic growth is represented as a weighted sum of sigmoidal phases, subject to stringent constraints that ensure parameter identifiability, temporal consistency, and biological plausibility. The methodology integrates a workflow to address nonlinear regression in high-dimensional parameter spaces. A two-stage optimization strategy using Differential Evolution for global search followed by L-BFGS-B for local refinement avoid bias and heuristic parameter initialization. A Charbonnier loss function and the Robust Regression and Outlier Removal procedure are employed to identify and mitigate experimental outliers. Model parsimony is enforced using Akaike (AIC, AICc) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria to select the optimal number of growth phases and avoid overparameterization. The framework was evaluated using experimental anaerobic digestion datasets, demonstrating that conventional single-phase models can obscure relevant metabolic transitions in co-digestion systems.</description>

      <title>A Paradigm Shift in Human Neuroscience Research: Progress, Prospects, and a Proof of Concept for Population Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances and reflections on reproducible human neuroscience, especially brain-wide association studies (BWAS) leveraging large datasets, have led to divergent and sometimes opposing views on research practices and priorities. The debates span multiple dimensions. Shifts along these axes have fractured consensus and further fragmented an already heterogeneous field of cognitive neuroscience. Here, we sketch a holistic and integrative response grounded in population neuroscience, organized around a closed-loop "design-analysis-interpretation" research cycle that aims to build consensus while bridging these divides. Our central claim is that population neuroscience offers a unique population-level vantage point for identifying general principles, characterizing inter-individual variabilities, and benchmarking intra-individual changes, thereby providing a supportive framework for small-scale, mechanism-focused studies at the individual level and allowing them to co-evolve with population-level studies. Population neuroscience is not simply about providing larger N for BWAS; its deeper goal is to accumulate a family of cross-scale priors and shared infrastructures that can support design, analysis, and interpretation of human neuroscience for decades to come. In this sense, we outline a "third-generation" view of population neuroscience that reorients the field from amassing isolated associations toward building integrative reference frameworks for future mechanistic and translational work.</description>

      <title>Structure from Noise: Confirmation Bias in Particle Picking in Structural Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational pipelines of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) include an early particle-picking stage, in which a micrograph or tomogram is scanned to extract candidate particles, typically via template matching or deep-learning-based techniques. The extracted particles are then passed to downstream tasks such as classification and 3D reconstruction. Although it is well understood empirically that particle picking can be sensitive to the choice of templates or learned priors, a quantitative theory of the bias introduced by this stage has been lacking.
  Here, we develop a mathematical framework for analyzing bias in template matching-based detection with concrete applications to cryo-EM and cryo-ET. We study this bias through two downstream tasks: (i) maximum-likelihood estimation of class means in a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and (ii) 3D volume reconstruction from the extracted particle stack. We show that when template matching is applied to pure noise, then under broad noise models, the resulting maximum-likelihood estimates converge asymptotically to deterministic, noise-dependent transforms of the user-specified templates, yielding a structure from noise effect. We further characterize how the resulting bias depends on the noise statistics, sample size, dimension, and detection threshold. Finally, controlled experiments using standard cryo-EM software corroborate the theory, demonstrating reproducible structure from noise artifacts in low-SNR data.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Deep Learning Based Glenoid Bone Loss Measurement and Severity Stratification on 3D CT in Shoulder Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To develop and validate a fully automated, deep-learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT scans using linear-based, en-face view, and best-circle method. Shoulder CT scans of 81 patients were retrospectively collected between January 2013 and March 2023. Our algorithm consists of three main stages: (1) Segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied a principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The performance of the pipeline was evaluated using DSC for segmentation and MAE and ICC for bone-loss measurement; intermediate outputs (rim point sets and en-face view) were also assessed. Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings, exceeding surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (ICC 0.84 vs 0.78 for all patients; ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 for low bone loss; ICC 0.83 vs 0.21 for high bone loss; P &lt; 0.001). For the classification task of assigning each patient to different bone loss severity subgroups, the pipeline's sensitivity was 71.4% for the low-severity group and 85.7% for the high-severity group, with no instances of misclassifying low as high or vice versa. A fully automated, deep learning-based pipeline for glenoid bone-loss measurement on CT scans can be a clinically reliable tool to assist clinicians with preoperative planning for shoulder instability. We are releasing our model and dataset at https://github.com/Edenliu1/Auto-Glenoid-Measurement-DL-Pipeline .</description>

Abstract: Gene regulatory networks are typically modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with phenomenological Hill functions to represent transcriptional regulation. While computationally efficient, Hill functions lack mechanistic grounding and cannot capture stochastic promoter dynamics. We present a hybrid Markovian-ODE framework that explicitly models discrete promoter states while maintaining computational tractability. Our approach tracks individual transcription factor binding events as a continuous-time Markov chain, coupled with deterministic ODEs for molecular concentrations. We validate this framework on seven gene regulatory systems spanning basic to advanced complexity: the GAL system, repressilator, Goodwin oscillator, toggle switch, incoherent feed-forward loop, p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Comparison with stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) ground truth demonstrates that Markovian promoter models achieve similar accuracy to full stochastic simulations while being 10-100$\times$ faster. Our framework provides a mechanistic foundation for gene regulation modeling and enables investigation of promoter-level stochasticity in complex regulatory networks.</description>
