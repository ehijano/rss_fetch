      <title>Near-inertial Pollard Waves Modeling the Arctic Halocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit exact solution to the governing equations describing the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean region centered around the North Pole. The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a top layer with uniform velocity and a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, nearinertial Pollard waves.</description>

      <title>Fast response of deep ocean circulation to mid-latitude winds in the Atlantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{In situ} observations of transbasin deep ocean transports at $26^\circ$N show variability on monthly to decadal timescales (2004--2015). Satellite-based estimates of ocean bottom pressure from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites were previously used to estimate interannual variability of deep ocean transports at $26^\circ$N. Here, we use GRACE ocean bottom pressure, reanalysis winds and \textit{in situ} transport estimates at $26^\circ$N to diagnose the large-scale response of the deep ocean circulation to wind-forcing. We find that deep ocean transports -- including those associated with a reversal of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in 2009/10 and 2010/11 -- are part of a large-scale response to wind stress curl over the intergyre-gyre region. Wind-forcing dominates deep ocean circulation variability on monthly timescales, but interannual fluctuations in the residual \textit{in situ} transports (after removing the wind-effect) are also captured by GRACE bottom pressure measurements. On decadal timescales, uncertainty in regional trends in GRACE ocean bottom pressure preclude investigation of decadal-timescale transport trends.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism-Learning Deeply Coupled Model for Remote Sensing Retrieval of Global Land Surface Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from remote sensing data is pivotal for analyzing climate processes and surface energy budgets. However, LST retrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem, which becomes particularly severe when only a single band is available. In this paper, we propose a deeply coupled framework integrating mechanistic modeling and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of single-channel LST retrieval. Training samples are generated using a physically-based radiative transfer model and a global collection of 5810 atmospheric profiles. A physics-informed machine learning framework is proposed to systematically incorporate the first principles from classical physical inversion models into the learning workflow, with optimization constrained by radiative transfer equations. Global validation demonstrated a 30% reduction in root-mean-square error versus standalone methods. Under extreme humidity, the mean absolute error decreased from 4.87 K to 2.29 K (53% improvement). Continental-scale tests across five continents confirmed the superior generalizability of this model.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Ekman-Stokes Model for Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate representation of atmosphere-ocean boundary layers, including the interplay of turbulence, surface waves, and air-sea fluxes, remains a challenge in geophysical fluid dynamics, particularly for climate simulations. This study introduces a stochastic coupled Ekman-Stokes model (SCESM) developed within the physically consistent Location Uncertainty framework, explicitly incorporating random turbulent fluctuations and surface wave effects. The SCESM integrates established parameterizations for air-sea fluxes, turbulent viscosity, and Stokes drift, and its performance is rigorously assessed through ensemble simulations against LOTUS observational data. A performance ranking analysis quantifies the impact of different model components, highlighting the critical role of explicit uncertainty representation in both oceanic and atmospheric dynamics for accurately capturing system variability. Wave-induced mixing terms improve model performance, while wave-dependent surface roughness enhances air-sea fluxes but reduces the relative influence of wave-driven mixing. This fully coupled stochastic framework provides a foundation for advancing boundary layer parameterizations in large-scale climate models.</description>

      <title>From Winter Storm Thermodynamics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably identifying and understanding temporal precursors to extreme wind gusts is crucial for early warning and mitigation. This study proposes a simple data-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical extreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these precursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited training data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting. Testing various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality reduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear transformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value distributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield interpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining satisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association between a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity in Northwestern Europe.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous layout and device parameter optimisation of a wave energy park in an irregular sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of optimal wave energy parks, namely, arrays of devices known as wave energy converters (WECs) that extract energy from water waves, is an important consideration for the renewable transition. In this paper, the problem of simultaneously optimising the layout and device parameters of a wave energy park is considered within the framework of linear water wave theory. Each WEC is modelled as a heaving truncated cylinder coupled to a spring-damper power take-off. The single-WEC scattering problem is solved using an integral equation/Galerkin method, and interactions between the WECs are solved via a self-consistent multiple scattering theory. The layout of the array and power take-off parameters of its constituent devices are simultaneously optimised using a genetic algorithm, with the goal of maximising energy absorption under a unidirectional, irregular sea described by a Pierson--Moskowitz spectrum. When constrained to a rectangular bounding box that is elongated in the direction of wave propagation, the optimal arrays consist of graded pseudo-line arrays when the number of WECs is sufficiently large. Moreover, low-frequency waves propagate further into the array than high-frequency waves, which is indicative of rainbow absorption, namely, the effect wherein waves spatially separate in a graded array based on their frequency, and are preferentially absorbed at these locations. Arrays optimised for a square bounding box did not show strong evidence of grading or rainbow reflection, which indicates that more complicated interaction effects are present.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with static sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is difficult because of the multiscale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lack accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank ``many wrong models'' and to blend their predictions. We evaluated our \emph{weighted Bayesian update} algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the turbulent transport of odors in presence of a strong mean wind. Despite minimal prior information on the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stratification on Surface-Intensified Eastward Jets in Turbulent Gyres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the role of stratification in the formation and persistence of eastward jets (like the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio currents). Using a wind-driven, two-layer quasi-geostrophic model in a double-gyre configuration, we construct a phase diagram to classify flow regimes. The parameter space is defined by a criticality parameter \( \xi \), which controls the emergence of baroclinic instability, and the ratio of layer depths \( \delta \), which describes the surface intensification of stratification. Eastward jets detaching from the western boundary are observed when \( \delta \ll 1 \) and \( \xi \sim 1 \), representing a regime transition from a vortex-dominated western boundary current to a zonostrophic regime characterized by multiple eastward jets. Remarkably, these surface-intensified patterns emerge without considering bottom friction. The emergence of the coherent eastward jet is further addressed with complementary 1.5-layer simulations and explained through both linear stability analysis and turbulence phenomenology. In particular, we show that coherent eastward jets emerge when the western boundary layer is stable, and find that the asymmetry in the baroclinic instability of eastward and westward flows plays a central role in the persistence of eastward jets, while contributing to the disintegration of westward jets.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-LAM: Probabilistic Limited Area Weather Forecasting with Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective for weather forecasting, based on the speed and accuracy compared to traditional numerical models. While early efforts primarily concentrated on deterministic predictions, the field has increasingly shifted toward probabilistic forecasting to better capture the forecast uncertainty. Most machine learning-based models have been designed for global-scale predictions, with only limited work targeting regional or limited area forecasting, which allows more specialized and flexible modeling for specific locations. This work introduces Diffusion-LAM, a probabilistic limited area weather model leveraging conditional diffusion. By conditioning on boundary data from surrounding regions, our approach generates forecasts within a defined area. Experimental results on the MEPS limited area dataset demonstrate the potential of Diffusion-LAM to deliver accurate probabilistic forecasts, highlighting its promise for limited-area weather prediction.</description>
