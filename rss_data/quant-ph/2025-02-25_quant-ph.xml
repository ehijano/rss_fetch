      <title>Fast quantum simulation of electronic structure by spectrum amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most advanced techniques using fault-tolerant quantum computers to estimate the ground-state energy of a chemical Hamiltonian involve compression of the Coulomb operator through tensor factorizations, enabling efficient block-encodings of the Hamiltonian. A natural challenge of these methods is the degree to which block-encoding costs can be reduced. We address this challenge through the technique of spectrum amplification, which magnifies the spectrum of the low-energy states of Hamiltonians that can be expressed as sums of squares. Spectrum amplification enables estimating ground-state energies with significantly improved cost scaling in the block encoding normalization factor $\Lambda$ to just $\sqrt{2\Lambda E_{\text{gap}}}$, where $E_{\text{gap}} \ll \Lambda$ is the lowest energy of the sum-of-squares Hamiltonian. To achieve this, we show that sum-of-squares representations of the electronic structure Hamiltonian are efficiently computable by a family of classical simulation techniques that approximate the ground-state energy from below. In order to further optimize, we also develop a novel factorization that provides a trade-off between the two leading Coulomb integral factorization schemes -- namely, double factorization and tensor hypercontraction -- that when combined with spectrum amplification yields a factor of 4 to 195 speedup over the state of the art in ground-state energy estimation for models of Iron-Sulfur complexes and a CO$_{2}$-fixation catalyst.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Annealing for Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) has been proposed to manage the uncertainties driven by the integration of renewable energy sources. When solved by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes a binary integer programming which is NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical computational methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables so that the qubit consumption becomes independent of the increasing number of bender's cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks and enables a sequential solution. Consequently, the Quantum-based PHR-ADMM (QPHR-ADMM) can significantly reduce qubit requirements and enhancing the applicability of QA in SUC problem. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed QPHR-ADMM algorithm, indicating its superior time efficiency over classical approaches for large scale QUBO problems under the D-Wave QPU showcases.</description>

      <title>EHands: Quantum Protocol for Polynomial Computation on Real-Valued Encoded States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel constructive EHands protocol defines a universal set of quantum operations for multivariable polynomial transformations on quantum processors by introducing four basic subcircuits: multiplication, addition, negation, and parity flip, and by using expectation-value encoding (EVEN) to represent real numbers in quantum states. These elementary arithmetic operations can be systematically composed to compute degree-$d$ polynomials, $P_d(x)$, on a QPU. The resulting quantum circuit structure closely mirrors the stepwise evaluation of polynomials on a classical calculator, providing an intuitive and efficient approach to polynomial computation on quantum hardware. By enabling direct, predictable polynomial and nonlinear data transformations on a QPU, our method reduces dependence on classical post-processing in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, enabling advancements in many quantum algorithms. The EHands quantum circuits are compact enough to deliver meaningful and accurate results on today's noisy quantum processors. We present a detailed implementation of $P_4(x)$ and report experimental results for polynomial approximations of common functions, obtained using IBM's Heron-class quantum processors and an ideal Qiskit simulator.</description>

      <title>A closed quantum system giving ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [This is the unpublished supplemental information from 1989 to the paper: J.M. Deutsch, "Quantum statistical mechanics in a closed system." Phys. Rev. A, 43(4), 2046 (1991).]
  A closed quantum mechanical system does not necessarily give time averages in accordance with the microcanonical distribution. This question is investigated if the number of degrees of freedom N is large. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, experimental situations are discussed that show a violation of the usual statistical mechanical rules. It is shown that by applying a finite but very small perturbation to such systems, the results of quantum statistical mechanics can indeed be recovered. The form of the perturbation is that of a banded random matrix, which has been used previously to describe strongly chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit. The properties of energy eigenfunctions for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the microcanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the limit of large N.</description>

      <title>Rotational decoherence dynamics in ultracold molecules induced by a tunable spin environment: The Central Rotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum rotational wavepacket dynamics in molecules can be described by a new system-environment model, which consists of a rotational subsystem coupled to a magnetically tunable spin bath formed by the nuclear spins within the molecule. The central rotor model shares similarities with the paradigmatic central spin model, but features much richer rotational dynamics that is sensitive to the molecule's environment, which can be initiated and probed with short laser pulses used to control molecular orientation and alignment. We present numerical simulations of the nuclear-spin-bath-induced rotational decoherence dynamics of KRb molecules, which exhibit remarkable sensitivity to an external magnetic field. Our results show that ultracold molecular gases provide a natural platform for the experimental realization of the CRM.</description>

      <title>Absence of censoring inequalities in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ref. 1 asked whether deleting gates from a random quantum circuit architecture can ever make the architecture a better approximate $t$-design. We show that it can. In particular, we construct a family of architectures such that the approximate $2$-design depth decreases when certain gates are deleted. We also give some intuition for this construction and discuss the relevance of this result to the approximate $t$-design depth of the 1D brickwork. Deleting gates always decreases scrambledness in the short run, but can sometimes cause it to increase in the long run. Finally, we give analogous results for spectral gaps and when deleting edges of interaction graphs.</description>

      <title>Atoms, Worldlines, and the Failure of the Scalar Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldline path-integral method, developed thus far for scalar fields, offers promising computational efficiency in general geometries, However, it relies so far on the scalar approximation that decomposes electromagnetic waves into two independent polarizations. In this work, we investigate different theoretical frameworks of fluctuation-induced effects and analyze the limitations of the worldline path-integral method in modeling multiple-atom Casimir-Polder interactions. In particular, we ask the question: how accurate is the scalar approximation? Using the worldline approach, it appears that a simple sum of the contributions from the two polarizations agrees with the exact Casimir-Polder force for two-atom systems. However, it turns out that this agreement is fortuitous. To enable calculations beyond two atoms via worldlines, we develop general $N$-atom expressions for the Casimir-Polder force within the scalar approximation. For three-body systems, the scalar worldline method fails drastically, predicting significant discrepancies in both magnitude and sign due to strong polarization mixing. Furthermore, we show that the TE/TM decomposition in the worldline method differs from that of the Green-tensor formalism, and we discuss why this is. This study highlights the inadequacy of scalar worldline models that rely on the polarization-decomposition approximation in general geometries.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Eigen- and Singular-value Transformation Oracles: From Algorithmic Applications to Hardware Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To showcase the oracle's representation-theoretic power, and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. In doing so, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancilla qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of eigenstate preparation in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation -- applicable in both near-term and large-scale quantum processors -- expressing high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system, and we provide details for 1D and 2D examples. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Contextual Explanation of Quantum Paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We celebrate this year hundred years of quantum mechanics but there is still no consensus regarding its interpretation and limitations. In this article we advocate the statistical contextual interpretation which is free of paradoxes. State vectors and various operators are purely mathematical entities allowing making quantitative probabilistic predictions. State vector describes an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems and a specific operator represents a class of equivalent measurements of a physical observable. A collapse of wave function is not a mysterious and instantaneous physical process. A collapsed quantum state describes a new ensemble of physical systems prepared in a particular way. Probabilities are objective properties of random experiments in which empirical frequencies stabilize. Therefore, quantum probabilities do not provide a complete description of individual physical systems and their interactions. Whether these probabilities can be explained as emergent is an open question which cannot be settled by philosophical discussions and no-go theorems. It can be only answered by more detailed study of experimental data then it is usually done. Bell Tests allowed rejecting Bell local and Bell causal hidden variable models but we even don't know whether quantum probabilities provide a complete description of existing experimental data. Time series of experimental data may contain much more information than it is obtained using empirical frequencies and histograms. Therefore, predictable completeness of quantum mechanics has be tested and not taken for granted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove by construction that the Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal bound on the spatial density of stabilizer codes does not generalize to stabilizer circuits. To do so, we construct a fault tolerant quantum computer with a coding rate above 5% and quasi-polylog time overhead, out of a line of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity, and prove it has a threshold. The construction is based on modifications to the tower of Hamming codes of Yamasaki and Koashi (Nature Physics, 2024), with operators measured using a variant of Shor's measurement gadget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Dirac oscillator in $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$ dimensions and present its generalizations in the spirit of the isotonic oscillator. In $(1+1)$ dimensions, the Dirac oscillator returns to quantum harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, while its generalization maps to the isotonic oscillator. We describe exact solutions of these generalized systems and also present their non-relativistic limits. Finally, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we show that a generalized Dirac oscillator in $(2+1)$ dimensions can be mapped to an anti-Jaynes-Cummings-like Hamiltonian in which the spin operators couple with the supercharges.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Based Sub-QUBO Extraction for Hybrid QUBO Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. However, the size of the solvable problem is limited by the number of qubits. To leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to solve large-scale QUBO problems, one possible way is to decompose the full problem into multiple sub-problems, which we refer to as the Sub-QUBO Formalism. In this work, we enhance this formalism by proposing a sub-QUBO extraction protocol. To do so, we define a measure to quantify correlations between variables and use it to build a correlation matrix. This matrix serves as the input for clustering algorithms to group variables. Variables belonging to the same group form sub-QUBOs and are subsequently solved using QAOA. Our numerical analysis on several classes of randomly generated QUBO problems demonstrates that this grouping method outperforms previous approaches in terms of objective function values, while maintaining a comparable number of quantum subroutine calls. This method offers wide applicability for solving QUBO problems on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Ultralong-lived Coherent States in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ Optical Ceramics for Quantum Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth ions (REI) in solid materials are among the leading systems for quantum technology applications. However, developing practical REI quantum devices with long-lived coherent states remains challenging due to great growth difficulties of high-quality REI materials and a lack of comprehensive understanding of REI's decoherence mechanisms. Here we realize a record optical coherence time of 421.5 $\pm$ 10.5 $\mu$s for the $^7$F$_0\rightarrow^5$D$_0$ transition and more than 30 hours lifetime for the $^7$F$_0$ hyperfine spin states in Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$O$_3$ optical ceramics. We report the elimination of two-level-system induced optical decoherence in short-range ordered crystals. Meanwhile, a new decoherence mechanism caused by new kinds of perturbing magnetic centers is identified below 1.5 K. We further demonstrate the coherent light storage over 5 $\mu$s by using the atomic frequency comb protocol. These results open up prospects for the realization of practical quantum memories and large scale quantum communications with REI optical ceramics.</description>

      <title>Boundary Perturbation Effects in Quantum Systems with Conserved Energy and Continuous Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one-dimensional systems with both energy conservation and a continuous symmetry, focusing on the impact of a boundary perturbation that breaks the continuous symmetry. Our study examines the quantum dynamics resulting from this boundary perturbation and identifies two distinct phases: one in which the corresponding charge exhibits extensive fluctuations, and another where the charge remains conserved. These phenomena are observed in both free and interacting models. The emergence of the charge-frozen phase is attributed to energy conservation, and we demonstrate that this phase disappears when energy conservation is broken or replaced by other symmetries. We provide an explanation using the effective Hamiltonian derived from degenerate perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated single-mode coherent-squeezed light source using four-wave mixing in microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light constitutes a key resource for quantum optical technologies including quantum sensing, computing, communication and metrology. For many applications, however, the generation of squeezed light typically requires at least two nonlinear optical stages involving careful phase and frequency matching to achieve the required mixing of squeezed and coherent light. In our work, we introduce an on-chip system that simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light, utilizing only a single squeezing stage. We achieved this by pumping a silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) microring resonator to produce single-mode squeezed light through four-wave mixing at the same frequency as the pump mode, leveraging the inherent $\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity of the $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ resonator. Our on-chip system demonstrates a squeezing of -4.7 dB, and we provide a theoretical model that describes the straightforward yet robust generation of single-mode squeezing at the injection locking point of the ring resonator. Overall, our findings highlight an approach which drastically simplifies the generation of squeezed light in photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Ginzburg effect with nonclassical states of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the acoustic Ginzburg effect using a toy model consisting of a mass-spring chain and a detector. This effect is characterized by the excitation of the detector from its ground state and the generation of acoustic phonons in the chain from the vacuum when the detector travels at a uniform speed greater than the speed of sound. By analyzing a scenario where the detector travels in a superposition of two trajectories at different uniform velocities relative to the center of mass of the chain, we find that the reduced state of either the chain phonons or the detector's internal excitations differ when the detector is in a superposition of distinct trajectories as compared with a single localized trajectory. This distinction enables the chain or the detector to act as a quantum device to distinguish the detector's trajectory.</description>

      <title>A graph-theoretic approach to chaos and complexity in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has recently been considerable interest in studying quantum systems via \textit{dynamical Lie algebras} (DLAs) -- Lie algebras generated by the terms which appear in the Hamiltonian of the system. However, there are some important properties that are revealed only at a finer level of granularity than the DLA. In this work we explore, via the \textit{commutator graph}, average notions of scrambling, chaos and complexity over ensembles of systems with DLAs that possess a basis consisting of Pauli strings. Unlike DLAs, commutator graphs are sensitive to short-time dynamics, and therefore constitute a finer probe to various characteristics of the corresponding ensemble. We link graph-theoretic properties of the commutator graph to the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), the frame potential, the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian of the system, and the Krylov complexity of operators evolving under the dynamics. For example, we reduce the calculation of average OTOCs to a counting problem on the graph; separately, we connect the Krylov complexity of an operator to the module structure of the adjoint action of the DLA on the space of operators in which it resides, and prove that its average over the ensemble is lower bounded by the average shortest path length between the initial operator and the other operators in the commutator graph.</description>

      <title>Decision-tree decoders for general quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Decision Tree Decoders (DTDs), which rely only on the sparsity of the binary check matrix, making them broadly applicable for decoding any quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) code and fault-tolerant quantum circuits. DTDs construct corrections incrementally by adding faults one-by-one, forming a path through a Decision Tree (DT). Each DTD algorithm is defined by its strategy for exploring the tree, with well-designed algorithms typically needing to explore only a small portion before finding a correction. We propose two explicit DTD algorithms that can be applied to any qLDPC code: (1) A provable decoder: Guaranteed to find a minimum-weight correction. While it can be slow in the worst case, numerical results show surprisingly fast median-case runtime, exploring only $w$ DT nodes to find a correction for weight-$w$ errors in notable qLDPC codes, such as bivariate bicycle and color codes. This decoder may be useful for ensemble decoding and determining provable code distances, and can be adapted to compute all minimum-weight logical operators of a code. (2) A heuristic decoder: Achieves higher accuracy and faster performance than BP-OSD on the gross code with circuit noise in realistic parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques of p-adic analysis, it is possible to formulate a rigorous version of the quantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, consistent with the existence of the Planck length. Such a model cannot be formulated if we use R^{3} as a model for physical space. The experimental testability of physical theories at the Planck scale is currently impossible. Here, we provide an indirect, theoretical argument that shows that the p-adic QM has physical content. We show that a large class of Schr\"odinger equations describes the scaling limits of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs (stochastic automata). These quantum walks appear as fundamental tools in quantum computing. We conjecture that this interpretation is valid in a general framework. The `new theory' does not have Lorentz symmetry, and the Einstein causality is violated. This fact does not contradict the so-called no-communication theorem; such a result requires as a primary hypothesis that R^{4} be a valid model for space-time at the Planck scale. Thus, the no-communication theorem under the discreteness of the space is an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), utilizes continuous variables encoding such as the quadra-ture components of the quantized electromagnetic field and coherent detection decoding, offering good compatibility with the existing telecommunications technology and components. Continuous variable measurement-device-independent QKD (CV-MDI-QKD) can eliminate all the security threats arising from the receiver effectively, the crucial security loophole of CV-QKD implementations. Recently, CV-MDI-QKD has attracted extensive attentions and witnessed rapid progress. Here, we review the achievements that have been made in the field of CV-MDI-QKD, including the basic principle, advancements in theoretical protocols and experimental demonstrations. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in practical applications and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encoding of Structured Data with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing faces a fundamental challenge: the amplitude encoding of an arbitrary n-qubit state vector generally requires {\Omega}(2n) gate operations. We can, however, form dimensionality-reduced representations of quantum states using matrix product states (MPS), providing a promising pathway to the efficient amplitude encoding of states with limited entanglement entropy. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of MPS representations to encode a wide range of functions and images using O(n)-depth circuits without any ancilla qubits, computed with the so-called Matrix Product Disentangler algorithm with tensor network optimisation. We find that MPS-based state preparation enables the efficient encoding of functions up to low-degree piecewise polynomials with accuracy exceeding 99.99% accuracy. We also showcase a novel approach to encoding structured image data based on MPS approximations of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation, which is shown to prepare a 128x128 ChestMNIST image on 14 qubits with fidelity exceeding 99.1% on a circuit with a total depth of just 425 single-qubit rotation and two-qubit CNOT gates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced response at exceptional points in multi-qubit systems for sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points featuring enhanced energy response to perturbation hold significant potential in detection and measurement of weak signals. Of particular interest is the existence and property of high-order exceptional points in quantum systems, owing to the capability to provide high-order response to perturbations. We investigate the exceptional points in a system of $n$ identical qubits possessing parity-time-reversal symmetry. We prove that owing to an incomplete coalescence of eigenstates, the highest possible order of exceptional point is $n+1$, which is also the upper bound of the order of energy response to perturbation. More interestingly, by considering an Ising-type interaction, we analytically prove that to achieve an $(m+1)$-th order response for any $m \le n$, the system must acquire a nontrivial $m$-body interaction. Finally, we propose a Floquet driving scheme to implement an effective multi-body Ising-type interaction, which can be realized in trapped ions or superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Image Current Detection of Electrons in a Room-Temperature Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the image current detection of electrons in a room-temperature Paul trap at microwave frequencies. By selectively leveraging distinct cavity modes for trapping and detection, our approach effectively extracts electron signals otherwise buried in the microwave drive used for pseudo-potential formation. When the trapped electrons resonate with the cavity mode, we observe a mode excitation and its exponential decay attributed to resistive cooling. Detuning electrons from the cavity resonance halts this decay, and sweeping electrons' secular frequency reveals their oscillatory spectrum. Implementing this experiment at cryogenic temperatures could enable the image current detection and ground-state cooling of a single electron in Paul traps.</description>

      <title>Commercial scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometer in a closed-cycle cryostat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to measure magnetic fields on the nanometre scale at cryogenic temperatures is key to understand magnetism on the quantum level and to develop materials for new storage devices or quantum computers. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have proven to be a robust means to harness quantum sensing for such applications. We have developed an instrument to measure the magnetic stray field of a sample with nanometre resolution from 2 K to 300 K and that accepts samples without additional preparation, especially the need to prepare a microwave line on the sample. The instrument features a software-interface for controlling and synchronising all included optical, mechanical and electronic devices and which analyses the acquired information in real time.
  We present the key features and measurement results achieved with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips hosting an NV centre and a fully remote controllable microscope platform. The magnetometer is commercially available, and a first demonstrator has been installed in a research facility. We show micro Tesla per square root Hertz sensitivity, low noise AFM tip control and optically detected resonance scans in a closed-cycle cryostat.</description>

      <title>OPAQUE: Obfuscating Phase in Quantum Circuit Compilation for Efficient IP Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum compilers play a crucial role in quantum computing by converting these algorithmic quantum circuits into forms compatible with specific quantum computer hardware. However, untrusted quantum compilers present considerable risks, including the potential theft of quantum circuit intellectual property (IP) and compromise of the functionality (e.g. Trojan insertion). Quantum circuit obfuscation techniques protect quantum IP by transforming a quantum circuit into a key-dependent version before compilation and restoring the compiled circuit's functionality with the correct key. This prevents the untrusted compiler from knowing the circuit's original functionality. Existing quantum circuit obfuscation techniques focus on inserting key qubits to control key gates. One added key gate can represent at most one Boolean key bit. In this paper, we propose OPAQUE, a phase-based quantum circuit obfuscation approach where we use the angle of rotation gates as the secret keys. The rotation angle is a continuous value, which makes it possible to represent multiple key bits. Moreover, phase gates are usually implemented as virtual gates in quantum hardware, diminishing their cost and impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Matter-Wave Quantum Superposition of Inertial and Constant Acceleration Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three different methods of calculating the non-relativistic dynamics of a quantum matter-wave evolving in a superposition of the inertial and accelerated motions. The relative phase between the two, which is classically unobservable as it is a gauge transformation, can be detected in a matter-wave interference experiment. The first method is the most straightforward and it represents the evolution as an exponential of the Hamiltonian. Based on the Heisenberg picture, the second method is insightful because it gives us extra insight into the independence of the wave-packet spreading of the magnitude of acceleration. Also, it demonstrates that the Heisenberg picture is perfectly suited to capturing all aspects of quantum interference. The final method shows the consistency with the full relativistic treatment and we use it to make a point regarding the equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Fixed Linear Ramp Schedule for Truss Structure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel structural optimization framework based on quantum variational circuits, in which the multiplier acting on the cross-sectional area of each rod in a truss structure as an updater is used as a design variable. Specifically, we employ a classical processor for structural analysis with the finite element method, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is subsequently performed to update the cross-sectional area so that the compliance is minimized. The advantages of this framework can be seen in three key aspects. First, by defining design variables as multipliers, rather than simply reducing the design variable to a binary candidate of inclusion or exclusion (corresponding to qubit states, ``0" and ``1"), it provides greater flexibility in adjusting the cross-sectional area of the rod at each iteration of the optimization process. Second, the multipliers acting on rods are encoded with on-off encoding, eliminating additional constraints in the convergence judgement. As a result, the objective function is in a simple format, enabling efficient optimization using QAOA.Third, a fixed linear ramp schedule (FLRS) for variational parameter setting bypasses the classical optimization process, thereby improving the operational efficiency of the framework. In the two structural cases investigated in this study, the proposed approach highlights the feasibility and applicability potential of quantum computing in advancing engineering design and optimization. Numerical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework, providing a firm foundation for future research on quantum-assisted optimization methods in engineering fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Microwave-Optical Photon Conversion Using Cavity Modes Strongly Hybridized with a Color Center Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microwave-optical photon converter with high efficiency ($&gt;50$ %) and low added noise ($\ll 1$ photon) could enable the creation of scalable quantum networks where quantum information is distributed optically and processed in the microwave regime. However, integrated converters demonstrated to date lack sufficient co-operativity or are too lossy to provide the required performance. Here we propose a bi-directional microwave-optical converter employing an ensemble of spin-bearing color centers hosted within a high-Q Si photonic resonator and coupled magnetically to a high-Q superconducting microwave resonator. We develop a theory for microwave-optical conversion when the ensemble of centers is strongly hybridized with one or both cavities, and find a counterintuitive operating point where microwave and optical photons are tuned to bare center/cavity resonances. Compared to the perturbative coupling regime, we find a substantially enhanced nonlinearity, making it possible to obtain the required co-operativity with reduced pump- and center-induced losses, and improved robustness to optical inhomogeneous broadening. Taking color center and optical pump-induced losses into account in both the Si photonic and superconducting resonators, we find that $\sim 95$ % total efficiency and added noise $\ll 1$ quanta is possible at low ($\mu$W) pump powers for both Er- and T-centers in Si. Our results open new pathways towards quantum networks using microwave-optical converters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy with entanglement has shown great potential to break limitations of traditional spectroscopic measurements, yet the role of entanglement in spectroscopic multi-parameter joint measurement, particularly in the infrared optical range, remains elusive. Here, we find an uncertain relation that constrains the precision of infrared spectroscopic multi-parameter measurements using entangled photon pairs. Under such a relation, we demonstrate a trade-off between the measurement precisions of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of the medium in the infrared range, and also illustrate how to balance their respective estimation errors. Our work shall provide guidance towards the future experimental designs and applications in entanglement-assisted spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dissipative dynamics near the stable states (attractors) of a driven Duffing oscillator. A refined perturbation theory that can treat two perturbative parameters with different orders is developed to calculate the quantum properties of Duffing oscillator near the attractors. We obtain the perturbative analytical results for the renormalized level spacings and the quantum-fluctuation-induced distribution of higher energy levels near the attractor, which are then verified by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong damping induces a slight renormalization of level spacing, and the renormalized Bose distribution affected by dephasing. Our work provides new insights into the quantum dynamics of driven Duffing oscillator and offers a theoretical framework that can be applied to related quantum system near their stable states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.</description>

      <title>Parametric Hypersensitivity and Transport in the Steady-State Open-System Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of an open-system Holstein model with linear bias displays extreme sensitivity to the closed system parameters. This sensitivity is shown to correspond to avoided crossings in the closed system spectrum, as previously demonstrated in the Rabi model. We then develop a kinetic model to analyze the effects of environmental parameters on NESS hypersensitivity. This reveals that hypersensitivity only exists in intermediate environmental parameter regimes, a prediction that is verified numerically. The inherent spatial character of the Holstein model offers a natural connection to transport, revealing that transport properties in the steady-state regime can be optimized by simultaneously coordinating the closed- and open-system parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Next-Generation Reservoir Computing and Its Quantum Optical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) exploits the information-processing capabilities of quantum systems to tackle time-series forecasting tasks, which is expected to be superior to their classical counterparts. By far, many QRC schemes have been theoretically proposed. However, most of these schemes involves long-time evolution of quantum systems or networks with quantum gates. This poses a challenge for practical implementation of these schemes, as precise manipulation of quantum systems is crucial, and this level of control is currently hard to achieve with the existing state of quantum technology. Here, we propose a different way of QRC scheme, which is friendly to experimental realization. It implements the quantum version of nonlinear vector autoregression, extracting linear and nonlinear features of quantum data by measurements. Thus, the evolution of complex networks of quantum gates can be avoided. Compared to other QRC schemes, our proposal also achieves an advance by effectively reducing the necessary training data for reliable predictions in time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we experimentally verify our proposal by performing the forecasting tasks, and the observation matches well with the theorectial ones. Our work opens up a new way toward complex tasks to be solved by using the QRC, which can herald the next generation of the QRC.</description>

      <title>From Exponential to Quadratic: Optimal Control for a Frustrated Ising Ring Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponentially small spectral gaps are known to be the crucial bottleneck for traditional Quantum Annealing (QA) based on interpolating between two Hamiltonians, a simple driving term and the complex problem to be solved, with a linear schedule in time. One of the simplest models showing exponentially small spectral gaps was introduced by Roberts et al., PRA 101, 042317 (2020): a ferromagnetic Ising ring with a single frustrating antiferromagnetic bond. A previous study of this model (C\^ot\'e et al., QST 8, 045033 (2023)) proposed a continuous-time diabatic QA, where optimized non-adiabatic annealing schedules provided good solutions, avoiding exponentially large annealing times. In our work, we move to a digital framework of Variational Quantum Algorithms, and present two main results: 1) we show that the model is digitally controllable with a scaling of resources that grows quadratically with the system size, achieving the exact solution using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA); 2) We combine a technique of quantum control -- the Chopped RAndom Basis (CRAB) method -- and digitized quantum annealing (dQA) to construct smooth digital schedules yielding optimal solutions with very high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of macrorealism violation via the QNDM protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequalities have been proposed to identify the quantum behaviour of a system; specifically, the violation of macrorealism. They are usually implemented by performing two sequential measurements on quantum systems, calculating the correlators of such measurements and then combining them arriving at Leggett-Garg inequalities. However, this approach only provides sufficient conditions for the violation of macrorealism. Recently, it was proposed an alternative approach that uses non-demolition measurements and gives both a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism. By storing the information in a quantum detector, it is possible to construct a quasi-probability distribution whose negative regions unequivocally identify the quantum behaviour of the system. Here, we perform a detailed comparison between these two approaches. The use of the IBM quantum simulators allows us to evaluate the performance in real-case situations and to include both the statistical and environmental noise. We find that the non-demolition approach is not only able to always identify the quantum features but it requires fewer resources than the standard Leggett-Garg inequalities. In addition, while the efficiency of the latter is strongly affected by the presence of the noise, the non-demolition approach results incredibly robust and its efficiency remains unchanged by the noise. These results make the non-demolition approach a viable alternative to the Leggett-Garg inequalities to identify the violation of macrorealism.</description>

      <title>Existence and Characterisation of Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17052v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the holy grails of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Finding good codes that can be implemented on near-term quantum hardware is among the key goals in the field of quantum computing. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters remains unknown. In this Article, we explore these parameters by focusing on the subclass of coprime BB codes. In many cases, we can efficiently predict code parameters by leveraging the ring structure of these codes. Finally, we demonstrate asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</description>

      <title>Measuring network quantum steerability utilizing artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network quantum steering plays a pivotal role in quantum information science, enabling robust certification of quantum correlations in scenarios with asymmetric trust assumptions among network parties. Despite its significance, efficient methods for measuring network quantum steerability remain elusive. To tackle this issue, we develop a neural network-based method that can be generalized to arbitrary quantum networks, providing an effective framework for steerability analysis. Our method demonstrates remarkable accuracy and efficiency in single-source scenarios, specifically bipartite and multipartite steering scenarios, with numerical simulations involving isotropic states and noisy GHZ states showing consistent results with established findings. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility in the bilocal steering scenario, where an untrusted central party shares two-qubit isotropic states of different visibilities, $\nu$ and $\omega$, with trusted endpoint parties and performs a single Bell state measurement (BSM). Through explicit construction of network local hidden state (NLHS) model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the entanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate that the threshold for the existence of network steering is determined by the curve $\nu \omega = {1}/{3}$ under the corresponding configuration.</description>

      <title>Continuous variable quantum teleportation, $U(2)$ invariant squeezing and non-Gaussian resource states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quadrature squeezing in the quantum teleportation protocol for coherent states, using non-Gaussian resource states. For the two-mode systems, the non-Gaussian resource states that we use are obtained by an experimentally realizable scheme of photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon catalysis, on the two-mode squeezed vacuum, and two-mode squeezed thermal states. We first analyze the non-classical attribute of quadrature squeezing in these generated non-Gaussian states using the $U(2)$ invariant squeezing approach, which allows us to account for all possible quadratures. We then show that the presence of such non-classicality in non-Gaussian resource states is not necessary for successful quantum teleportation, a finding which is at variance with an earlier result in this direction. This result is important since it demonstrates how non-classicality other than quadrature squeezing present in the resource can be utilized for quantum teleportation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holonomic quantum computation exploits the geometric evolution of eigenspaces of a degenerate Hamiltonian to implement unitary evolution of computational states. In this work we introduce a framework for performing scalable quantum computation in atom experiments through a universal set of fully holonomic adiabatic gates. Through a detailed differential geometric analysis, we elucidate the geometric nature of these gates and their inherent robustness against classical control errors and other noise sources. The concepts that we introduce here are expected to be widely applicable to the understanding and design of error robustness in generic holonomic protocols. To underscore the practical feasibility of our approach, we contextualize our gate design within recent advancements in Rydberg-based quantum computing and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of collective baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance of single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of collective baths. We consider a system of two qubits, each locally dissipating into its own bath while being coupled to a common bath. In this setup, we investigate different scenarios for temperature estimation of both the common and local baths. First, we explore how the precision of a single-qubit probe for the temperature of the common bath may be enhanced by the collective effects generated by the bath itself, if the second qubit is in resonance with the probe. We also analyze how the presence of additional local baths on each qubit may jeopardize, or improve, this result. Next, we show that one qubit may serve as a probe to measure the temperature of the local bath, affecting the other qubit by exploiting their interaction mediated by the common bath. This approach enables remote temperature sensing without directly coupling the probe to the target qubit or its local environment, thereby minimizing potential disturbances and practical challenges. However, in the absence of a direct qubit-qubit coupling, this protocol works only for very high temperatures of the local bath whose temperature we aim at estimating. This being said, remote temperature sensing works for broader temperature regimes in the presence of a direct coupling between the qubits. Furthermore, we also investigate the impact of dephasing and the dynamics of quantum correlations in the model for remote temperature sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly driven nonlinear systems are frequently encountered in physics, yet their accurate control is generally challenging due to the intricate dynamics. In this work, we present a non-perturbative, semi-analytical framework for tailoring such systems. The key idea is heuristically extending the Floquet theory to nonlinear differential equations using the Harmonic Balance method. Additionally, we establish a novel constrained optimization technique inspired by the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enables accurate engineering of effective potentials across a broader parameter space, surpassing the limitations of perturbative methods. Our method offers practical implementations in diverse experimental platforms, facilitating nonclassical state generation, versatile bosonic quantum simulations, and solving complex optimization problems across quantum and classical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor's algorithm efficiently solves factoring and discrete logarithm problems using quantum computers, compromising all public key schemes used today. These schemes rely on assumptions on their computational complexity, which quantum computers can easily bypass. The solutions have to come from new algorithms - called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) - or from new methods, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The former replicate the computational security ideas of classical public key algorithms, while the latter recurs to use the quantum properties of nature, which also brings a mathematical security proof, potentially offering Information-Theoretic Security. To secure data in the future, we must adopt these paradigms. With the speed of quantum computing advancements, the transition to quantum-safe cryptography within the next decade is critical. Delays could expose long-lived confidential data, as current encryption may be broken before its value expires. However, the shift must balance the adoption of new technologies with maintaining proven systems to protect against present and future threats. In this work, we have selected Transport Layer Security, one of the most widely used protocols, as the foundation to hybridize classical, quantum, and post-quantum cryptography in a way suitable for broad adoption in Software-Defined Networking, the most flexible networking paradigm that has been used to deploy integrated quantum-classical networks. To this end, we use standards for QKD key extraction and SDN integration. The purposed implementation is based on the latest version of TLS and demonstrates advanced capabilities such as rekeying and key transport across a large QKD network, while supporting crypto-agility and maintaining backward compatibility through the use of ciphersuites. The performance of this approach has been demonstrated using a deployed production infrastructure.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to accounting for correlations in evolution over time of an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A projection operator is introduced, which exactly transforms the inhomogeneous Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized master equation for the relevant part of a system +bath statistical operator, containing the inhomogeneous irrelevant term comprising the initial corrrelations, into the homogeneous equation accounting for initial correlations in the kernel governing its evolution. No "molecular chaos"-like approximation has been used. The obtained equation is equivalent to completely closed (homogeneous) equation for the statistical operator of a system of interest interacting with a bath. In the Born approximation (weak system-bath interaction) this equation can be presented as the time-local Redfield-like equation with additional terms caused by initial correlations. As an application, a quantum oscillator, interacting with a Boson field and driven from a Gibbs initial equilibrium system+bath state by an external force, is considered. All terms determining the oscillator evolution over time are explicitly calculated.at all timescales. It is shown, how the initial correlations influence the evolution process. It is also demonstrated, that at the large timescale this influence vanishes, and the evolution equation for the quantum oscillator statistical operator acquires the Lindblad form..</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Fisher Information matrix (QFIM) plays a crucial role in quantum optimization algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution and Quantum Natural Gradient Descent. However, computing the full QFIM incurs a quadratic computational cost of O(d^2) with respect to the number of parameters d, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional quantum systems. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a novel estimation framework based on Stein's identity that reduces the computational complexity to a constant. Numerical simulations on the Ising and Schwinger models demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach, enabling effective optimization in Variational Quantum Algorithms.</description>

      <title>High quality superconducting tantalum resonators with beta phase defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum circuit simulation of a chaotic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) measurements have provided a promising pathway to explore quantum chaos and information scrambling. However, despite recent advancements, their experimental realization remains challenging due to the complexity of implementing backward time evolution. Here, we present a scalable quantum circuit combined with the interferometric protocol, offering a more efficient framework for OTOC measurement. Using this method, we simulate commutator growth in integrable and chaotic regimes of a 9-qubit Ising chain. Our Trotterized circuit achieves errors below $10^{-11}$ with 4th-order Trotterization and performs well even with lower-order Trotterization approximations. We believe, this approach paves the way for studying information dynamics, highly entangled quantum systems, and complex observables efficiently.</description>

      <title>Qoala: an Application Execution Environment for Quantum Internet Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a first-of-its-kind operating system for programmable quantum network nodes was developed, called QNodeOS. Here, we present an extension of QNodeOS called Qoala, which introduces (1) a unified program format for hybrid interactive classical-quantum programs, providing a well-defined target for compilers, and (2) a runtime representation of a program that allows joint scheduling of the hybrid classical-quantum program, multitasking, and asynchronous program execution. Based on concrete design considerations, we put forward the architecture of Qoala, including the program structure and execution mechanism. We implement Qoala in the form of a modular and extendible simulator that is validated against real-world quantum network hardware (available online). However, Qoala is not meant to be purely a simulator, and implementation is planned on real hardware. We evaluate Qoala's effectiveness and performance sensitivity to latencies and network schedules using an extensive simulation study. Qoala provides a framework that opens the door for future computer science research into quantum network applications, including scheduling algorithms and compilation strategies that can now readily be explored using the framework and tools provided.</description>

      <title>Optimized circuits for windowed modular arithmetic with applications to quantum attacks against RSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Windowed arithmetic [Gidney, 2019] is a technique for reducing the cost of quantum arithmetic circuits with space--time tradeoffs using memory queries to precomputed tables. It can reduce the asymptotic cost of modular exponentiation from $O\left(n^3\right)$ to $O\left(n^3/\log^2 n\right)$ operations, resulting in the current state-of-the-art compilations of quantum attacks against modern cryptography. In this work we introduce four optimizations to windowed modular exponentiation. We (1) show how the cost of unlookups can be reduced by $66\%$ asymptotically in the number of bits, (2) illustrate how certain addresses can be bypassed, reducing both circuit depth and the overall lookup cost, (3) demonstrate that multiple lookup--addition operations can be merged into a single, larger lookup at the start of the modular exponentiation circuit, and (4) reduce the depth of the unary conversion for unlookups. On a logical level, this leads to a $3\%$ improvement in Toffoli count and Toffoli depth for modular exponentiation circuits relevant to cryptographic applications. This translates to some improvements on [Gidney and Eker\r{a}, 2021]'s factoring algorithm: for a given number of physical qubits, our improvements show a reduction in the expected runtime from $2\%$ to $6\%$ for factoring $\mathsf{RSA}$-$2048$ integers.</description>

Abstract: Today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have scientific value, but quantum machines with broad practical value must be protected against noise using quantum error correction and fault-tolerant protocols. Recent studies of quantum error correction on actual hardware are opening a new era of quantum information processing.

      <title>Coexistence of continuous-variable quantum key distribution and classical data over 120-km fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with classical data transmission over the same fiber is crucial for scalable quantum-secured communication. However, noise from classical channels limits QKD distance. We demonstrate the longest-distance continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) over 120 km (20 dB loss) coexisting with a fully populated coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM) system. Natural mode filtering of the local oscillator and phase noise mitigation enabled this without additional filtering or wavelength reallocation. Benchmarking against a commercial discrete-variable QKD system and considering finite-size effects confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD as a plug-and-play solution for typical 80--100 km long-haul optical networks. Our results set a record distance for CV-QKD, showing its potential for cost-effective, large-scale deployment in existing network infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understating the limitations imposed by quantum noise in precision measurements and devising techniques to reduce it. The attention is currently turning to the simultaneously estimation of several parameters of interest, driven by its promising potential across a wide range of sensing applications as well as fueled by experimental progress in various optical and atomic platforms. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of key research directions in multiparameter quantum sensing and metrology, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. We introduce the basic framework, discuss ultimate sensitivity bounds, optimal measurement strategies, and the role of quantum incompatibility, showing important differences with respect to single-parameter estimation. Additionally, we discuss emerging experimental implementations in distributed quantum sensing, including cutting-edge optimization techniques. This review aims to bridge the gap between theory and experiments, paving the way for the next-generation of quantum sensors and their integration with other quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Parallelized telecom quantum networking with a ytterbium-171 atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of quantum computers and sensors into a quantum network opens a new frontier for quantum information science. We demonstrate high-fidelity entanglement between ytterbium-171 atoms -- the basis for state-of-the-art atomic quantum processors and optical atomic clocks -- and optical photons directly generated in the telecommunication wavelength band where loss in optical fiber is minimal. We entangle the nuclear spin of the atom with a single photon in the time bin basis, and find an atom measurement-corrected (raw) atom-photon Bell state fidelity of $0.950(9)\pm0.005(3)_\text{bound}$ ($0.90(1)\pm0.014(3)_\text{bound}$). Photon measurement errors contribute $\approx0.037$ to our infidelity and can be removed with straightforward upgrades. Additionally, by imaging our atom array onto an optical fiber array, we demonstrate a parallelized networking protocol that can provide an $N$-fold boost in the remote entanglement rate. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to preserve coherence on a memory qubit while performing networking operations on communication qubits. Our work is a major step towards the integration of atomic processors and optical clocks into a high-rate or long-distance quantum network.</description>

      <title>Bosonic two-stroke heat engines with polynomial nonlinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of two-stroke heat engines where two bosonic modes $a$ and $b$ are coupled by the general nonlinear interaction $V_{\theta} = \exp {(\theta a^{\dagger n}b^m - \theta^*a^nb^{\dagger m})}$. By adopting the two-point measurement scheme we retrieve the distribution of the stochastic work, and hence the relative fluctuations of the extracted work up to the second order in the coupling $\theta$. We identify the optimal interactions providing large average work with small fluctuations in the operational regime of the heat engine. Then, we consider the specific cases $n=2$, $m=1$ and $n=1$, $m=2$ up to the fourth order in $\theta$. We optimize the average work and the signal-to-noise ratio over the frequencies of the bosonic modes and the temperatures of the reservoirs. Finally, we determine the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for these processes in relation with the order of the expansion of the unitary interaction $V_{\theta}$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement fidelity of Petz decoder for one-shot entanglement transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot entanglement transmission is a quantum information processing task where a quantum state is sent to a second party over a noisy channel. The goal of the task is to approximately recover the original state by applying a decoder to the output of the noisy channel. In this work, we note that the Petz map induces a universal decoder for one-shot entanglement transmission, and we quantify its entanglement fidelity. This fidelity is found to be determined by the singly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order 1/2 associated with a complementary channel, thus providing an operational interpretation of this information measure. Furthermore, we compare the performance of this decoder to that of the decoder induced by the twirled Petz map and the Schumacher-Westmoreland decoder.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's mid-gap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a novel framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.</description>

      <title>Correlated Dephasing in a Piezoelectrically Transduced Silicon Phononic Waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical waveguides offer a multitude of applications in quantum and classical technologies. Here, we design, fabricate, and characterize a compact silicon single-mode phononic waveguide actuated by a thin-film lithium niobate piezoelectric element. Our device directly transduces between microwave frequency photons and phonons propagating in the silicon waveguide, providing a route for coupling to superconducting circuits. We probe the device at millikelvin temperatures through a superconducting microwave resonant matching cavity to reveal harmonics of the silicon waveguide and extract a piezoelectric coupling rate $g/2\pi= 1.1$ megahertz and a mechanical coupling rate $f/2\pi=5$ megahertz. Through time-domain measurements of the silicon mechanical modes, we observe energy relaxation timescales of $T_{1,\text{in}} \approx 500$ microseconds, pure dephasing timescales of $T_\phi \approx {60}$ microseconds and dephasing dynamics that indicate the presence of an underlying frequency noise process with a non-uniform spectral distribution. We measure phase noise cross-correlations between silicon mechanical modes and observe detuning-dependent positively-correlated frequency fluctuations. Our measurements provide valuable insights into the dynamics and decoherence characteristics of hybrid piezoelectric-silicon acoustic devices, and suggest approaches for mitigating and circumventing noise processes for emerging quantum acoustic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond has emerged as a powerful tool for measuring diverse physical parameters, yet the versatility of these measurement approaches is often limited by the achievable layout and dimensionality of bulk-crystal platforms. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to creating designer quantum sensors by surface-functionalizing multiphoton lithography microstructures with NV-containing nanodiamonds. We showcase this capability by fabricating a 150 $\mu$m x 150 $\mu$m x 150 $\mu$m triply periodic minimal surface gyroid structure with millions of attached nanodiamonds. We demonstrate a means to volumetrically image these structures using a refractive index matching confocal imaging technique, and extract ODMR spectra from 1.86 $\mu$m x 1.86 $\mu$m areas of highly concentrated nanodiamonds across a cross section of the gyroid. Furthermore, the high density of sensing elements enables ensemble temperature measurements with sensitivity of 0.548 {\deg}K/$\sqrt{Hz}$ at 5 mW excitation power. This approach to creating quantum-enabled microarchitectures opens new possibilities for multimodal sensing in complex three-dimensional environments.</description>

Abstract: Setting out a path to use quantum computing within a company is not as straightforward as the implementation of classical ICT-projects. The technology is fundamentally different and not mature yet, which makes the development and use uncertain, non-linear and more complex. Being also a potential disruptive technology makes it for a company important to be aware of the possible business value generated by using quantum computing and be prepared for taking this technology in production. In this article we present Quantum Organisational Readiness Levels to determine the degree of readiness for implementation of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum lattice Boltzmann method for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise to accelerate scientific computations in fluid dynamics and other classical physical systems. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed for linear flows, developing quantum algorithms for nonlinear problems remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel node-level ensemble description of lattice gas for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics on a quantum computer. This approach combines the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method, which offers low-dimensional representation, and lattice gas cellular automata, which provide linear collision treatment. Building on this framework, we propose a quantum lattice Boltzmann method that relies on linear operations with medium dimensionality. We validated the algorithm through comprehensive simulations of benchmark cases, including vortex-pair merging and decaying turbulence on $2048^2$ computational grid points. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with direct numerical simulation, effectively capturing the essential nonlinear mechanisms of fluid dynamics. This work offers valuable insights into developing quantum algorithms for other nonlinear problems, and potentially advances the application of quantum computing across various transport phenomena in engineering.</description>

      <title>MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact while allowing flexible, data-efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym on highly varied datasets such as a high-dimensional spring mesh system (Otness et al., 2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Our results demonstrate superior performance in modeling dynamics under few-shot adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with far larger models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Space Symmetry and Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On one hand, the concept of Quantum Phase Space which is compatible with the uncertainty principle has been considered recently. It has also been shown that a natural symmetry that can be associated with this quantum phase space is the symmetry corresponding to Linear Canonical Transformations (LCTs). On the other hand, sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that are expected to be important for the understanding of physics beyond the current standard model of particle physics. The existence of these particles are suggested both from theoretical and experimental sides. In this work, the objective is to discuss about the symmetry of quantum phase space corresponding to the LCT group and its relation to the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. It is shown that the spin representation of the LCT group associated to the quantum phase, for a signature (1, 4), suggests the existence of sterile neutrinos and lead to a new way for describing them. The mathematical formalism developed in this work provides a new framework for the study of neutrinos physics.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of the Anderson Transition on Small-World Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson transition on random graphs draws interest through its resemblance to the many-body localization (MBL) transition with similarly debated properties. In this Letter, we construct a unitary Anderson model on Small-World graphs to characterize long time and large size wave-packet dynamics across the Anderson transition. We reveal the logarithmically slow non-ergodic dynamics in the critical regime, confirming recent random matrix predictions. Our data clearly indicate two localization times: an average localization time that diverges, while the typical one saturates. In the delocalized regime, the dynamics are initially non-ergodic but cross over to ergodic diffusion at long times and large distances. Finite-time scaling then allows us to characterize the critical dynamical properties: the logarithm of the average localization time diverges algebraically, while the ergodic time diverges exponentially. Our results could be used to clarify the dynamical properties of MBL and could guide future experiments with quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Random Matrix Theory in quantum chaotic systems: A Perspective from Observable Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study deviations from random matrix theory (RMT) in quantum chaotic systems from a perspective of observable properties. Specifically, we focus on the envelope function of the off-diagonal elements of few-body observables written in the eigenbasis of a quantum chaotic manybody system, as introduced in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz. Our objective is to understand the origin of the nontrivial structure of the envelope function in real systems and its connection to the distance of the system from a fully random system described by RMT. To this end, we introduce a method to systematically induce randomness into a real model, which eventually transitions into a random matrix model. Our numerical simulations of a defect Ising model show that the nontrivial structure of the envelope function of local spins becomes less pronounced as the randomness of the system increase, eventually disappearing when the system becomes fully random. Our results imply that the structure of the envelope function of few-body observables is closely related to the randomness of the system, which can be used to characterize the deviation from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (SLAHM), where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and laser-induced near-fields provides a platform to study ultrafast processes and quantum phenomena while enabling precise manipulation of electron wavefunctions through linear and orbital momentum transfer. Here, by introducing phase offset between two orthogonally polarized laser pulses exciting a gold nanorod, we generate a rotating plasmonic nearfield dipole with clockwise and counterclockwise circulating orientations and investigate its interaction with a slow electron beam. Our findings reveal that the circulation direction of plasmonic fields plays a crucial role in modulating electron dynamics, enhancing coupling strength, and controlling recoil. Furthermore, synchronizing the interaction time of the electron beam with rotational dipolar plasmonic resonances results in significant transfer of angular momenta to the electron beams and deflects the electron wavepackets from their original trajectory. These findings highlight the potential of plasmon rotors for shaping electron wavepackets, offering promising applications in ultrafast microscopy, spectroscopy, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>1 Particle - 1 Qubit: Particle Physics Data Encoding for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17310v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of Zeeman and hyperfine optical pumping and transverse laser cooling of a dysprosium (Dy) atomic beam on the $4f^{10}6s^2(J = 8) \rightarrow 4f^{10}6s6p(J = 9)$ transition at 421.291 nm. For $^{163}$Dy, an electro-optic modulator is used to generate five frequency sidebands required to pump the atoms to the $F = 10.5$ ground state hyperfine level and the light polarization is chosen to pump the atoms to the $m_F = 10.5$ Zeeman sublevel. The atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled using a standing wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. The resulting polarized and cooled atomic beam will be used in fundamental physics experiments taking advantage of the accidental degeneracy of excited states in Dy including the ongoing measurement of parity violation in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light are essential for emerging quantum technology in metrology and information processing. Chip-integrated photonics offers a route to scalable and efficient squeezed light generation, however, parasitic nonlinear processes and optical losses remain significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate single-mode quadrature squeezing in a photonic crystal microresonator via degenerate dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Implemented in a scalable, low-loss silicon-nitride photonic-chip platform, the microresonator features a tailored nano-corrugation that modifies its resonances to suppress parasitic nonlinear processes. In this way, we achieve an estimated 7.8 dB of on-chip squeezing in the bus waveguide, with potential for further improvement. These results open a promising pathway toward integrated squeezed light sources for quantum-enhanced interferometry, Gaussian boson sampling, coherent Ising machines, and universal quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate similarities and differences between the main neo-Copenhagen (or "epistemic-pragmatist") interpretations of quantum mechanics, here identified as those defined by the rejection of an ontological nature of the quantum states and the simultaneous avoidance of hidden variables, while maintaining the quantum formalism unchanged. We argue that there is a single general interpretive framework in which the core claims that the various interpretations in the class are committed to, and which they emphasize to varying degrees, can be represented. We also identify, however, remaining differences of a more substantial nature, and we offer a first analysis of them. We also argue that these remaining differences cannot be resolved within the formalism of quantum mechanics itself and identify the more general philosophical considerations that can be used in order to break this interpretation underdetermination.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating quantum systems undergoing non-Gaussian dynamics in a fast and accurate manner is becoming fundamental to many quantum applications. Here, we focus on classical and quantum protocols transferring a state across a double-well potential. The classical protocols are achieved by deforming the potential, while the quantum ones are assisted by a counter-diabatic driving. We show that quantum protocols perform more quickly and accurately. Finally, we design a figure of merit for the performance of the transfer protocols -- namely, the protocol grading -- that depends only on fundamental physical quantities, and which accounts for the quantum speed limit, the fidelity and the thermodynamic of the process. We test the protocol grading with classical and quantum protocols, and show that quantum protocols have higher protocol grading than the classical ones.</description>

Abstract: Methods of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) have been growing ever more complex, and at the same time have more and more impact on people's lives. This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in the form of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of the explainability of such circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals. To this end, we apply the well-established concept of Shapley values. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification, generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results shed some light on the role of specific gates in popular QML approaches.</description>

Abstract: Strong coupling between single qubits is crucial for quantum information science and quantum computation. However, it is still challenged, especially for single solid-state qubit. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and {thus the coupling between the CPW resonator and the sequeezed magnons is exponentially enhanced}, which produces two cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling {approaches} the critical value (i.e., the frequency of the LP becomes zero), the spin is fully decoupled from the HP, while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling mediated by the LP is achieved with accessible parameters. Our proposal indicates that the critical cavity-magnon polarition is a potential interface to realize strong spin-spin coupling and manipulates remote solid spins.</description>

      <title>Unitary time evolution in quantum mechanics is a stronger physical postulate than linear time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discussions of quantum mechanics often loosely claim that time evolution logically must be unitary, in order for the probabilistic interpretation of the amplitudes of the state vector to make sense at all times. We discuss from first principles whether this claim is true: if we assume only that the time-evolution operator is *linear*, then does the stronger requirement that it be *unitary* follow from the other axioms of quantum mechanics? The answer is subtle. We discuss two mathematically distinct but physically equivalent formulations of the axioms of quantum mechanics, and consider generalizing each to postulate only that time evolution is linear. Within one formulation, the unitarity of time evolution follows logically from the other axioms -- but within the other formulation, it does not. Allowing the time-evolution operator be (a priori) arbitrarily linear does not change the physical observables in one formulation of quantum mechanics, but changes the other formulation to a *distinct* (internally consistent) physical theory that allows new phenomonology like (e.g.) faster-than-light communication. Therefore, the unitarity of time evolution is arguably better thought of as a logically independent and experimentally falsifiable axiom of quantum mechanics, not as a tautological consequence of the other axioms.</description>

Abstract: In the traditional approach to controlling superconducting qubits using microwave pulses, the field of pulse shaping has emerged in order to assist in the removal of leakage and increase gate fidelity. However, the challenge of scaling microwave control electronics has created an opportunity to explore alternative methods such as single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses. For qubits controlled by SFQ pulses, high fidelity gates can be achieved by optimizing the binary control sequence. We extend the notion of the derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) framework a transmon qubit controlled by SFQ drivers. The proposed implementation of SFQ pulse sequences can be stored in 22 bits or fewer, with gate fidelities exceeding 99.99%. This modest memory requirement could help reduce the footprint of the SFQ coprocessors and power dissipation while preserving their inherent advantages of scalability and cost-effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling represents an active approach towards the protection of quantum memories and quantum gates. Because dynamical decoupling operations can interfere with a system's own time evolution, the protection of quantum gates is more challenging than that of quantum states. In this work, we put forward a simple but general approach towards the realization of higher-order protection of quantum gates and further execute the first cloud-based demonstration of dynamical-decoupling-protected quantum gates at the first order and the second order. The central idea of our approach is to engineer (hence regain the control of) the gate Hamiltonian in coordination with higher-order dynamical decoupling sequences originally proposed for the protection of quantum memories. The physical demonstration on an IBM quantum processor indicates the effectiveness and potential of our approach on noisy intermediate scale quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: A key conjecture about the evolution of complex quantum systems towards an ergodic steady state, known as scrambling, is that this process acquires universal features when it is most efficient. We develop a single-parameter scaling theory for the spectral statistics in this scenario, which embodies exact self-similarity of the spectral correlations along the complete scrambling dynamics. We establish that the scaling predictions are matched by a privileged stochastic process and serve as bounds for other dynamical scrambling scenarios, allowing one to quantify inefficient or incomplete scrambling on all time scales.</description>

Abstract: Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations. Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations and hardware demonstration, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for studying quantum spin liquids and more generally for resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of compiling graphs under the parity transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a mathematical framework that utilizes concepts from graph theory to formalize the parity transformation, an encoding strategy for compiling optimization problems on quantum devices. We introduce the transformation as a mapping that encompasses all possible compiled hypergraphs and investigate its uniqueness properties in more detail. Specifically, by introducing so-called loop labelings, we derive an alternative expression of the preimage of any set of compiled hypergraphs under this encoding procedure when all equivalence classes of graphs are being considered. We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of physical layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined. In addition, we provide an algorithm which is based on classical algorithms from theoretical computer science and computes a compiled physical layout in this class in polynomial time.</description>

Abstract: Quantum non-demolition measurement plays an essential role in quantum technology, crucial for quantum error correction, metrology, and sensing. Conventionally, the qubit state is classified from the raw or integrated time-domain measurement record. Here, we demonstrate a method to enhance the assignment fidelity of the readout by considering the "path signature" of this measurement record, where the path signature is a mathematical tool for analyzing stochastic time series. We evaluate this approach across five different hardware setups, including those with and without readout multiplexing and parametric amplifiers, and demonstrate a significant improvement in assignment fidelity across all setups. Moreover, we show that the path signature of the measurement record has features that can be used to detect and classify state transitions that occurred during the measurement, improving the prediction of the qubit state at the end of the measurement. This method has the potential to become a foundational tool for quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted by $\rho = e^{-\beta H}/ \operatorname{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution over product states for all $\beta &lt; 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a constant. This proof of sudden death of thermal entanglement resolves the fundamental question of whether many-body systems can exhibit entanglement at high temperature.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $\beta &lt; 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^2)$, we can prepare a state $\varepsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\operatorname{poly}(n, 1/\varepsilon)$ classical overhead.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, and is an exploitable resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues and the associated applicability compromises hamper the practical applications. We report the first time-bin entangled detection-loophole-free steering nonlocality demonstration in a fully chip-fiber telecommunication system, with an ultra-fast measurement switching rate (1.25~GHz). In this endeavor, we propose the phase-encoding measurement scheme to adapt the system to time-bin degree of freedom, and design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation. An asymmetric configuration is introduced to mimic the active measurement implementation at the steering party thus bypassing the phase modulation loss. Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency required by conclusive quantum steering with multiple actively switched measurement settings. Our setup presents an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Inspired Quantum Noise Mitigation in Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Min-Entropy Calculation Of Classical-Quantum States And Its Application To Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum Shannon theory, various kinds of quantum entropies are used to characterize the capacities of noisy physical systems. Among them, min-entropy and its smooth version attract wide interest especially in the field of quantum cryptography as they can be used to bound the information obtained by an adversary. However, calculating the exact value or non-trivial bounds of min-entropy are extremely difficult because the composite system dimension may scale exponentially with the dimension of its subsystem. Here, we develop a one-shot lower bound calculation technique for the min-entropy of a classical-quantum state that is applicable to both finite and infinite dimensional reduced quantum states. Moreover, we show our technique is of practical interest in at least three situations. First, it offers an alternative tight finite-data analysis for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme. Second, it gives the best finite-key bound known to date for a variant of device independent quantum key distribution protocol. Third, it provides a security proof for a novel source-independent continuous-variable quantum random number generation protocol. These results show the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient inference of quantum system parameters by Approximate Bayesian Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently infer system parameters is essential in any signal-processing task that requires fast operation. Dealing with quantum systems, a serious challenge arises due to substantial growth of the underlying Hilbert space with the system size. As the statistics of the measurement data observed, i.e. the likelihood, can no longer be easily computed, common approaches such as maximum-likelihood estimators or particle filters become impractical. To address this issue, we propose the use of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm, which evades likelihood computation by sampling from a library of measurement data -- a priori prepared for a given quantum device. We apply ABC to interpret photodetection click-patterns arising when probing in real time a two-level atom and an optomechanical system. For the latter, we consider both linear and non-linear regimes, in order to show how to tailor the ABC algorithm by understanding the quantum measurement statistics. Our work demonstrates that fast parameter inference may be possible no matter the complexity of a quantum device and the measurement scheme involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate noise characterization in quantum gates and circuits is vital for the development of reliable quantum simulations for chemically relevant systems and fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper reviews a variety of key benchmarking techniques, including Randomized Benchmarking, Quantum Process Tomography, Gate Set Tomography, Process Fidelity Estimation, Direct Fidelity Estimation, and Cross-Entropy Benchmarking. We evaluate each method's complexities, the resources they require, and their effectiveness in addressing coherent, incoherent, and state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Furthermore, we introduce deterministic benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations. With the addition of DB to the toolkit of available benchmarking methods, this article serves as a practical guide for choosing and applying benchmarking protocols to advance quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging quantum computational power. We propose a simple approach, the Two-Step QAOA, which aims to improve the effectiveness of QAOA by decomposing problems with k-hot encoding QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulations. By identifying and separating the problem into two stages, we transform soft constraints into hard constraints, simplifying the generation of initial conditions and enabling more efficient optimization. The method is particularly beneficial for tackling complex societal problems that often involve intricate constraint structures.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether quantum computers can achieve exponential speedups in optimization has been a major open question in quantum algorithms since the field began. Here we introduce a quantum algorithm called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), which uses the quantum Fourier transform to reduce optimization problems to decoding problems. For approximating optimal polynomial fits to data over finite fields, DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation ratio than any polynomial time classical algorithm known to us, thus suggesting exponential quantum speedup. We also extend this to multivariate polynomials. These optimization problems are solved approximately by quantum reduction to decoding of Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, respectively. Sparse unstructured optimization problems such as max-k-XORSAT are reduced to decoding of LDPC codes. Although we have not identified quantum advantage for the sparse unstructured case, we prove a theorem which allows the performance of DQI to be calculated instance-by-instance based on the empirical performance of classical LDPC decoders such as belief propagation. We demonstrate this by benchmarking on an instance with over 30,000 variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tests of quantum steering in which the trusted party does not have perfect control of their measurements. We report on steering inequalities that remain unaffected when introducing up to a threshold magnitude of measurement imprecision. This phenomenon, which we call an imprecision plateau, thus permits a departure from the standard assumption of idealised measurements without any incuring cost to the detection power of steering experiments. We provide an explanation for why imprecision plateaus are possible, a simple criterion for their existence and tools for analysing their properties. We also demonstrate that these plateaus have natural applications when the assumption of perfect measurements is relaxed: they allow for maintaining both the noise- and loss-robustness of standard steering tests and the performance rate of idealised one-sided device-independent random number generators.</description>

      <title>QuCLEAR: Clifford Extraction and Absorption for Quantum Circuit Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing carries significant potential for addressing practical problems. However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\%$ reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an $84.1\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Helmholtz problems using finite elements leads to the resolution of a linear system which is challenging to solve for classical computers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum annealers could address this challenge. We first express the linear system arising from the Helmholtz problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem (gEVP). The obtained gEVP is mapped into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs) which we solve using an adaptive quantum annealing eigensolver (AQAE) and its classical equivalent. We identify two key parameters in the success of AQAE for solving Helmholtz problems: the system condition number and the integrated control errors (ICE) in the quantum hardware. Our results show that a large system condition number implies a finer discretization grid for AQAE to converge, leading to larger QUBOs and that AQAE is either tolerant or not with respect to ICE depending on the gEVP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent quantum calculations of the first order and second order photon correlation functions for the scattering of a single-photon pulse on a two-level atom (qubit) embedded in a one-dimensional open waveguide. Within Markov approximation we find the analytic expression for the quantum operator of positive frequency electric field. We restricted Hilbert space of initial states by the states with one and two excitations and show that the photon probability amplitudes are given by the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric field operator between these states. For two-excitation initial state where the atom is excited and there exists a single photon in a waveguide we calculate the second order correlation function which describes the measurements by two detectors at two different space-time points. The second order correlation function exhibits the interference term showing that the measurements of two detectors are correlated. This interference is similar to that found in the Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation experiment with two indistinguishable photons.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental mathematical models spanning virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the underlying symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new advances towards achieving exponential quantum speedups for solving optimization problems by low-depth quantum algorithms. Specifically, we focus on families of combinatorial optimization problems that exhibit symmetry and contain planted solutions. We rigorously prove that the 1-step Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can achieve a success probability of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, and sometimes $\Omega(1)$, for finding the exact solution in many cases. This allows us to prove a separation of $O(1)$ quantum queries and $\Omega(n/\log n)$ classical queries required to find the planted solution in the latter setting. Furthermore, we construct near-symmetric optimization problems by randomly sampling the individual clauses of symmetric problems, and prove that the QAOA maintains a strong success probability in this setting even when the symmetry is broken. Finally, we construct various families of near-symmetric Max-SAT problems and benchmark state-of-the-art classical solvers, discovering instances where all known general-purpose classical algorithms require exponential time. Therefore, our results indicate that low-depth QAOA may achieve an exponential quantum speedup for optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent terms in Hamiltonians and equations of motion are rather important for a quantum-mechanical description of particles with arbitrary spins in nonstationary fields. We use the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation which allows one to obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger picture of relativistic quantum mechanics. We determine exact nonexponential and exponential operators of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for arbitrary-spins particles in the nonstationary case. Some fundamental properties of these operators and the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian are also identified.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Laplace transform in quantum mechanics: correcting a flawed approach for the stationary Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laplace transform is a valuable tool in physics, particularly in solving differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. A 2014 study by Tsaur and Wang (2014 \emph{Eur.~J.~Phys.} \textbf{35} 015006) introduced a Laplace-transform-based method to solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for various potentials. However, their approach contains critical methodological flaws: the authors disregard essential boundary conditions and apply the residue theorem incorrectly in the inverse transformation process. These errors ultimately cancel out, leading to correct results despite a flawed derivation. In this paper, we revisit the use of the Laplace transform for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, clarifying correct practices in handling boundary conditions and singularities. This analysis offers a sound and consistent framework for the application of Laplace transforms in stationary quantum mechanics, underscoring their educational utility in quantum mechanics coursework.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Quantum-Token Protocol Benchmarked on IBM Quantum Processors</title>

Abstract: Quantum tokens envision to store unclonable keys in quantum states that can be used for personal authentication in a physical device issued by a bank, for instance. Still, its experimental realization faces many technical challenges. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based quantum-token protocol, having the potential to make these applications technologically less-demanding. Therefore, in order to demonstrate the safety of the protocol, a simple and minimal model based on an observable operator and measurement uncertainty is developed to describe the quantum token hardware, while the protocol is fully benchmarked and compared on five different IBM quantum processors. First, the uncertainties of the hardware are characterized, from which the main quality parameters that describe the token can be extracted. Following that, the fraction of qubits which the bank prepares and measures successfully is benchmarked. These fractions are then compared with the values obtained from an attacker who attempts to read the bank token and prepare a forged key. From which we experimentally demonstrate an acceptance probability of 0.059 for a single forged token, in contrast to 0.999 for the bank's own tokens. These values can be further optimized by increasing the number of tokens in the device, where even in the worst IBMQ, with 49 tokens the acceptance probability of forged tokens is below $10^{-22}$. Finally, we show that minor improvements in the hardware quality lead to significant increases in the protocol security, denoting a great potential of the protocol to scale with the ongoing quantum hardware evolution. This work demonstrates the overall security of the protocol within a hardware-agnostic framework, further confirming the interoperability of the protocol in arbitrary quantum systems and thus paving the way for future applications with different qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designs, structures connected to averaging with respect to a given measure using finite sets of points, have proven themselves as invaluable tools across the field of quantum information, finding their uses in state and process tomography, key distribution and others. In this work, we introduce a new concept of pushforward designs, which allows us to obtain new structures from already existing ones by mapping them between the spaces, with specific examples including simplex designs and mixed state designs from complex projective designs. Based on the general concept, we put forward a structure called channel $[t,k]$-design, allowing for averaging over space of quantum channels for systems in contact with an environment of dimension $k$. Based on this notion, we introduce the concept of effective environment dimensionality $k^*$, which we estimate for the IBM Kyoto quantum computer to be below $2.2$ for times up to $350\mu\text{s}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Conversion of $\mu s$-long Photons from the Visible to the Telecom-C-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Frequency Conversion (QFC) is a widely used technique to interface atomic systems with the telecom band in order to facilitate propagation over longer distances in fiber. Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency conversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at the single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ quantum memories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference frequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a MgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of duration up to 13.6 $\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;460 for 10 $\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on average. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity conversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing nodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Gradient Descent Without Coherent Oracle Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient descent method aims at finding local minima of a given multivariate function by moving along the direction of its gradient, and hence, the algorithm typically involves computing all partial derivatives of a given function, before updating the solution iteratively. In the work of Rebentrost et al. [New Journal of Physics, 21(7):073023, 2019], the authors translated the iterative optimization algorithm into a quantum setting, with some assumptions regarding certain structure of the given function, with oracle or black-box access to some matrix that specifies the structure. Here, we develop an alternative quantum framework for the gradient descent problem, based on the seminal quantum singular value transformation framework. We show that given only classical information of function of interest, it is possible to construct a quantum gradient descent algorithm with a running time logarithmical in the number of variables. In particular, our framework consumes exponentially less qubits than the prior quantum gradient descent algorithm and removes the need for any coherent oracle access to classical information. Thus, our work provides another example demonstrating the power of quantum singular value transformation framework, and in particular, it adds another instance revealing that quantum coherent access is not necessary for quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Bohr Model of the Atom through Brownian Motion of the Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we refine the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom by describing the motion of the electron through a single real-valued stochastic process, effectively realizing Brownian motion under the Born rule. Our approach derives the electron's stochastic equation of motion from the Fokker-Planck equation while ensuring the particle always maintains a definite - albeit random - position. This feature obviates the need for wave function collapse as invoked in the Copenhagen interpretation. Instead, the wave function serves as a tool to compute the electron's drift velocity. Building on this, we develop modified stochastic equations in spherical coordinates, tailored to the spherical symmetry of the hydrogen atom. We show that these equations reproduce the correct average radial and angular kinetic energies, matching operator-based quantum mechanical predictions. Numerical simulations confirm the stability of electron trajectories and, as expected, recover the probability distribution prescribed by the Born rule. At very short timescales, however, single-electron probability distributions may deviate from wave function-based predictions due to insufficient ensemble averaging. Taken together, these findings offer an alternative perspective on atomic structure and highlight the potential of using wave function-derived drift velocities within a single stochastic process to capture quantum dynamics in the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Microwave-Optical Entanglement in Kerr-Modified Cavity Optomagnomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave-optical entanglement is essential for efficient quantum communication, secure information transfer, and integrating microwave and optical quantum systems to advance hybrid quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnon Kerr effect can be harnessed to generate and control nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity optomagnomechanics (COMM). This effect induces magnon frequency shifts and introduces pair-magnon interactions, both of which are tunable through the magnetic field direction, enabling nonreciprocal behavior. By adjusting system parameters such as magnon frequency detuning, we show that magnon-phonon, microwave-optical photon-photon, and optical photon-magnon entanglement can be nonreciprocally enhanced and rendered more robust against thermal noise. Additionally, the nonreciprocity of entanglement can be selectively controlled, and ideal nonreciprocal entanglement is achievable. This work paves the way for designing nonreciprocal quantum devices across the microwave and optical regimes, leveraging the unique properties of the magnon Kerr effect in COMM.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Intensity Limits for Long-Distance Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables the sharing of cryptographic keys secured by quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol assumed single-photon sources, but practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-L\"utkenhaus-Preskill (GLLP) framework addressed these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds under limited PNS scenarios. The Decoy-state protocol further improved performance by refining single-photon yield estimates, but still considered multi-photon states as insecure, thereby limiting intensities and constraining key rate and distance. More recently, finite-key security bounds for decoy-state QKD have been extended to address general attacks, ensuring security against adversaries capable of exploiting arbitrary strategies. In this work, we focus on a specific class of attacks, the generalized PNS attack, and demonstrate that higher pulse intensities can be securely used by employing Bayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed data. By raising the pulse intensity to 10 photons, we achieve a 50-fold increase in key rate and a 62.2% increase in operational range (about 200 km) compared to the decoy-state protocol. Furthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a Hidden Markov Model and reveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that may produce erroneous key-rate estimates. While this methodology does not address all possible attacks, it provides a new approach to security proofs in QKD by shifting from worst-case assumption analysis to observation-dependent inference, advancing the reach and efficiency of discrete-variable QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximate Degenerate Ordered Statistics Decoding for Quantum Codes via Reliable Subset Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient decoding of quantum codes is crucial for achieving high-performance quantum error correction. In this paper, we introduce the concept of approximate degenerate decoding and integrate it with ordered statistics decoding (OSD). Previously, we proposed a reliability metric that leverages both hard and soft decisions from the output of belief propagation (BP), which is particularly useful for identifying highly reliable subsets of variables. Using the approach of reliable subset reduction, we reduce the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency in the code capacity noise model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BP+ADOSD approach through extensive simulations on a varity of quantum codes, including generalized hypergraph-product codes, topological codes, lift-connected surface codes, and bivariate bicycle codes. The results indicate that the BP+ADOSD decoder outperforms existing methods, achieving higher error thresholds and enhanced performance at low error rates. Additionally, we validate the efficiency of our approach in terms of computational time, demonstrating that ADOSD requires, on average, the same amount of time as two to three BP iterations on surface codes at a depolarizing error rate of around $1\%$. All the proposed algorithms are compared using single-threaded CPU implementations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the impact of non-Markovian classical noise on single-qubit randomized benchmarking experiments, in a manner that explicitly models the realization of each gate via realistic finite-duration pulses. Our new framework exploits the random nature of each gate sequence to derive expressions for the full survival probability decay curve which are non-perturbative in the noise strength. In the presence of non-Markovian noise, our approach shows that the decay curve can exhibit a strong dependence on the implementation method, with regimes of both exponential and power law decays. We discuss how these effects can complicate the interpretation of a randomized-benchmarking experiment, but also how to leverage them to probe non-Markovianty.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated Geometric Quantum Control over an Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information is very fragile to environmentally and operationally induced imperfections. Therefore, the construction of practical quantum computers requires quantum error-correction techniques to protect quantum information. In particular, encoding a logical qubit into the large Hilbert space of an oscillator is a hardware-efficient way of correcting quantum errors. In this strategy, selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates are vital for universal quantum control. However, the quality of SNAP gates is considerably limited by the small coupling-induced nonlinearity of the oscillator. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a robust scheme based on quantum optimal control via functional theory, by designing an appropriate trajectory for a target operation. Besides, we combine the geometric phase approach with our trajectory design scheme to minimize the decoherence effect, by shortening the gate time. Numerical simulation shows that both errors can be significantly mitigated and that the robustness of the geometric gate against both $X$ and $Z$ errors can be maintained. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising alternative for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>

Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, consistent with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

Abstract: We quantify how squeezed light can reduce quantum measurement noise to levels below the standard quantum limit in impulse measurements with mechanical detectors. The broadband nature of the signal implies that frequency-dependent squeezing performs better than frequency-independent squeezing. We calculate the optimal scaling of the impulse sensitivity with the squeezing strength, and quantify degradations due to photodetection losses. Even for lossless measurement, we find there exists a fundamental limit to the benefit of squeezing that depends only on the system's mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Effcient classical error correction for parity-encoded spin systems</title>

Abstract: Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have garnered engineering interest across various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate, with considerable efforts dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction among logical spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a parity-encoding (PE) architecture, which consists of an enlarged system of physical spins with only local connectivity among them, to circumvent this difficulty in developing near-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only alleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also possesses intrinsic fault tolerance, as logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded in the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses correcting errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected using a straightforward decoding algorithm that can be viewed as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm has been shown to perform comparably to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and enhances the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. Our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Design of LQG Controllers in Quantum Coherent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm specifically tailored for the design of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controllers in quantum systems. Building upon the foundational DE framework, the algorithm incorporates specialized modules, including relaxed feasibility rules, a scheduled penalty function, adaptive search range adjustment, and the ``bet-and-run'' initialization strategy. These enhancements improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities while addressing the unique physical realizability requirements of quantum systems. The proposed method is applied to a quantum optical system, where three distinct controllers with varying configurations relative to the plant are designed. The resulting controllers demonstrate superior performance, achieving lower LQG performance indices compared to existing approaches. Additionally, the algorithm ensures that the designs comply with physical realizability constraints, guaranteeing compatibility with practical quantum platforms. The proposed approach holds significant potential for application to other linear quantum systems in performance optimization tasks subject to physically feasible constraints.</description>

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for quantum computing applications in chemistry and materials science, particularly in addressing the limitations of classical methods for complex systems. This study benchmarks the performance of the VQE for calculating ground-state energies of aluminum clusters (Al$^-$, Al$_2$, and Al$_3^-$) within a quantum-density functional theory (DFT) embedding framework, systematically varying key parameters -- (I) classical optimizers, (II) circuit types, (III) number of repetitions, (IV) simulator types, (V) basis sets, and (VI) noise models. Our findings demonstrate that certain optimizers achieve efficient and accurate convergence, while circuit choice and basis set selection significantly impact accuracy, with higher-level basis sets closely matching classical computation data from Numerical Python Solver (NumPy) and Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB). To evaluate the workflow under realistic conditions, we employed IBM noise models to simulate the effects of hardware noise. The results showed close agreement with CCCBDB benchmarks, with percent errors consistently below 0.2 percent. The results establish VQE's capability for reliable energy estimations and highlight the importance of optimizing quantum-DFT parameters to balance computational cost and precision. This work paves the way for broader VQE benchmarking on diverse chemical systems, with plans to make results accessible on Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS) and develop a Python package to support the quantum chemistry and materials science communities in advancing quantum-enhanced discovery.</description>

      <title>On the Addressability Problem on CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in asymptotically good quantum codes have intensified research on their application in quantum computation and fault-tolerant operations. This study focuses on the addressability problem within CSS codes: what circuits might implement logical gates on strict subsets of logical qubits? With some notion of fault-tolerance, we show some impossibility results: for CSS codes with non-zero rate, one cannot address a logical H, HP, PH, nor CNOT to any non-empty strict subset of logical qubits using a circuit made only from 1-local Clifford gates.
  Furthermore, we show that one cannot permute the logical qubits in a code purely by permuting the physical qubits, if the rate of the code is (asymptotically) greater than 1/3 and the distance is at least 3. We can show a similar no-go result for CNOTs and CZs between two such high-rate codes, albeit with a less reasonable restriction to circuits that we call ``global'' (though recent addressable CCZ gates use global circuits).
  This work pioneers the study of distance-preserving addressability in quantum codes, mainly by considering automorphisms of the code. This perspective offers new insights and potential directions for future research. We argue that studying this trade off between addressability and efficiency of the codes is essential to understand better how to do efficient quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk Analysis in Quantum Networks: Detection and Localization Insights with photon counting OTDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical crosstalk from sub-milliwatt classical-channel power into quantum channels presents a significant challenge in quantum network development, introducing substantial noise that limits the network's performance, scalability, and fidelity. Here we report a demonstration using photon counting optical time-domain reflectometry ({\nu}-OTDR) to precisely identify and localize crosstalk between separate channels within the same fiber and between separate fibers. The coexistence of classical and quantum signals in the same network necessitates the use of optical switches for efficient routing and control. Crosstalk characterization of an optical switch reveals that crosstalk depends strongly on cross connect configuration, with higher levels observed when connections are presumed to be physically closer and lower levels when further apart. Additionally, we found that crosstalk exhibits a pronounced wavelength dependence, increasing over tenfold at longer wavelengths. These findings demonstrate the value of {\nu}-OTDR in diagnosing and mitigating crosstalk in quantum networks. They highlight the importance of optimizing optical switch configurations and wavelength management to minimize noise, ultimately enhancing the scalability, fidelity, and overall performance of quantum networks. This work establishes a foundational approach to addressing crosstalk, paving the way for more robust and efficient quantum network designs.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Quantum Simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories using gauge-invariant packaged quantum states \cite{Ma2017,Ma2025}. In this formalism, every single excitation transforms as a complete \textbf{irreducible representation (irrep)} of the local gauge group, preventing any appearance of fractional or partial \textbf{internal quantum numbers (IQNs)}. Multi-particle excitations can form nontrivial packaged entangled states that are also gauge invariant, thereby forbidding partial or fractional IQNs. In other words, all IQNs of such packaged entangled states remain inseparably entangled. This ``packaging principle'' ensures that physical states remain confined to the correct gauge sector and excludes partial charges or colors, even when multiple excitations are entangled.
  We illustrate this approach for $\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theories, discussing explicit constructions, Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution, and gauge-invariant measurements on a quantum simulator. We also outline how packaged states can mitigate gauge-violating errors and serve as natural building blocks for gauge-invariant coding schemes, while noting that standard quantum error correction is still required against typical local noise that respects gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Continuous-Wave Pumped Entanglement-based QKD in Noisy Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution to protect current cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computers. As QKD transitions from laboratories to real-world applications, its implementation under various environmental conditions has become a pressing challenge. Major obstacles to practical QKD implementation are the loss of photons in the transmission media and the presence of extreme noise, which can severely limit long-range transmission. In this paper, we investigate the impact of extreme noise on QKD system parameters, including detector timing uncertainty (jitter), measurement timing shifts, variations in detector deadtime, and rate-dependent detector efficiency. Contrary to manufacturers' specifications, which assume these parameters to be constant, we demonstrate that these parameters exhibit significant variations in extreme noise conditions. We show that changes in these parameters play a key role in determining system performance in noisy environments. To address these non-idealities, we develop a robust model that can address and adapt to various detector characteristics. In particular, our model is independent of source parameters and can be implemented using data from the detection unit. Our results show that our model is well suited for characterizing and optimizing the performance of the QKD system under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Existence of Schrodinger Evolution with Absorbing Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.12057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schr\"odinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a POVM.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Infinite Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07663v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the M\"obius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a Real-Time Computation of Timelike Hadronic Vacuum Polarization and Light-by-Light Scattering: Schwinger Model Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light-by-light scattering (HLBL) are crucial for evaluating the Standard Model predictions concerning the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. However, direct first-principle lattice gauge theory-based calculations of these observables in the timelike region remain challenging. Discrepancies persist between lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations in the spacelike region and dispersive approaches relying on experimental data parametrization from the timelike region. Here, we introduce a methodology employing 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the Schwinger Model, to investigate the HVP and HLBL. To that end, we use both tensor network techniques, specifically matrix product states, and classical emulators of digital quantum computers. Demonstrating feasibility in a simplified model, our approach sets the stage for future endeavors leveraging digital quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening a band gap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of topological edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators, as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we experimentally characterize the dispersion of edge states, and we examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience to various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum-locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. Also, we develop a theoretical model based on a Green's function approach that describes the square lattice of resonators and features quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of $\Gamma$ and $M$ high-symmetry points that are removed upon the introduction of bianisotropy, and apply this model to evaluate Berry curvature. The considered design opens possibilities in the construction of optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring topological edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling (QT) effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of QT. I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognise optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favour of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimised for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Measurement of total phase fluctuation in cold-atomic quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. We show that this approach can be used to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two parallel 1D Bose gases. This analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. Our method is general and can be applied to other cold atom systems with spatial phase gradients, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of non-relativistic fermions in $\mathbb R^d$ interacting through a pair potential. Employing methods developed by Buchholz in the framework of resolvent algebras, we identify an extension of the CAR algebra where the dynamics acts as a group of *-automorphisms, which are continuous in time in all sectors for fixed particle numbers. In addition, we identify a suitable dense subalgebra where the time evolution is also strongly continuous. Finally, we briefly discuss how this framework could be used to construct KMS states in the future.</description>

      <title>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and (Non)-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the quench spectroscopy method to dissipative and isolated non-Hermitian quantum lattice models via the case study of the open Bose-Hubbard chain and the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain respectively. We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the equation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Celestial Quantum Error Correction II: From Qudits to Celestial CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. At finite $N$ the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied $w_{1+\infty}$ hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.</description>

Abstract: We analyze semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators with potentials of class $C^{1,1/2}$ and establish commutator estimates for the associated projection operators in Schatten norms. These are then applied to prove quantitative versions of the local and phase space Weyl laws in $L^p$ spaces. We study both non-interacting, and interacting particle systems. In particular, we are able to treat the case of the minimizers of the Hartree energy in the case of repulsive singular pair interactions such as the Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multifractal-enriched mobility edges and emergent quantum phases in Rydberg atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, critical indicators for differentiating these states, such as Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and inverse participation ratios (IPRs), have yet to be experimentally detected. To address these challenges, we introduce exactly solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with flat bands, analytically determining phase boundaries using Avila's global theorem. We propose experimental realizations using Rydberg atom arrays, enabling the distinction of localized, extended, and multifractal states with as few as 18 qubits. Importantly, we develop a robust spectroscopic method for the experimental measurement of LEs and IPRs. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Superspin Renormalization and Slow Relaxation in Random Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Black Hole Mass Estimation in Type-2 AGNs: Classical vs. Quantum Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>
