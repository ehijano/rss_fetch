      <title>Multiscale Parallel Simulation of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma via Adaptive Domain Partitioning -- an Efficiency Analysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel parallel efficiency analysis on a framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumours is presented. Proliferation of MPM tumours in the pleural space is simulated using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). Using segmented lung data from CT scans, an environment is set up with artificial tumour data in the pleural space, representing the simulation domain, onto which a dynamic bounding box is applied to restrict computations to the region of interest, dramatically reducing memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning of the domain enables efficient use of computational resources by reducing the three-dimensional (3D) domain over which the PDEs are to be solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is realized using the public Python library mpi4py in combination with LinearGMRESSolver and PETSc for efficient convergence. Performance analyses have shown that parallelization achieves a reduced solving time compared to serial computation. Also, optimizations enable efficient use of available memory and improved load balancing amongst the cores.</description>

      <title>Transformers Applied to Short-term Solar PV Power Output Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasts of the power output from variable renewable energy generators like solar photovoltaic systems are important to balancing load on real-time electricity markets and ensuring electricity supply reliability. However, solar PV power output is highly uncertain, with significant variations occurring over both longer (daily or seasonally) and shorter (within minutes) timescales due to weather conditions, especially cloud cover. This paper builds on existing work that uses convolutional neural networks in the computer vision task of predicting (in a Nowcast model) and forecasting (in a Forecast model) solar PV power output (Stanford EAO SUNSET Model). A pure transformer architecture followed by a fully-connected layer is applied to one year of image data with experiments run on various combinations of learning rate and batch size. We find that the transformer architecture performs almost as well as the baseline model in the PV output prediction task. However, it performs worse on sunny days.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient inverse design of spinodoid metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create an data-efficient and accurate surrogate model for structure-property linkages of spinodoid metamaterials with only 75 data points -- far fewer than the several thousands used in prior works -- and demonstrate its use in multi-objective inverse design. The inverse problem of finding a material microstructure that leads to given bulk properties is of great interest in mechanics and materials science. These inverse design tasks often require a large dataset, which can become unaffordable when considering material behavior that requires more expensive simulations or experiments. We generate a data-efficient surrogate for the mapping between the characteristics of the local material structure and the effective elasticity tensor and use it to inversely design structures with multiple objectives simultaneously. The presented neural network-based surrogate model achieves its data efficiency by inherently satisfying certain requirements, such as equivariance with respect to permutations of structure parameters, which avoids having to learn them from data. The resulting surrogate of the forward model is differentiable, allowing its direct use in gradient-based optimization for the inverse design problem. We demonstrate in three inverse design tasks of varying complexity that this approach yields reliable results while requiring significantly less training data than previous approaches based on neural-network surrogates. This paves the way for inverse design involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where data efficiency is currently the limiting factor.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Selection in Short-Range Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations.
  In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Equations for Propagation Constant in Uniform or Periodic Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, simulation-based equations to calculate propagation constant in uniform or periodic structures (SES) are deduced and verified through simulations in various types of structures. The modeling of those structures are essentially based on field distributions from a driven-mode solver, and the field distributions are used as the input parameters of the FPPS. It allows the separation of forward and backward waves from a total wave inside such a uniform or periodic structure, and thus it can be used to calculate the propagation constants inside both uniform and periodic structures even with a strong reflection. In order to test the performance and function of the FPPS, it has been applied to a variety of typical structures, including uniform waveguides, lossfree closed structures, lossy closed structures, and open radiation structures, and compared with the results of eigenmode solvers, equivalent network methods, and spectral domain integral equation methods. The comparison shows the easy-to-use and adaptable nature of the FPPS. the FPPS. This FPPS could be also applied to open radiating structures, and even multi-dimensional periodic/uniform structures.</description>

      <title>Precision Glass Thermoforming Assisted by Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many glass products require thermoformed geometry with high precision. However, the traditional approach of developing a thermoforming process through trials and errors can cause large waste of time and resources and often end up with unsuccessfulness. Hence, there is a need to develop an efficient predictive model, replacing the costly simulations or experiments, to assist the design of precision glass thermoforming. In this work, we report a surrogate model, based on a dimensionless back-propagation neural network (BPNN), that can adequately predict the form errors and thus compensate for these errors in mold design using geometric features and process parameters as inputs. Our trials with simulation and industrial data indicate that the surrogate model can predict forming errors with adequate accuracy. Although perception errors (mold designers' decisions) and mold fabrication errors make the industrial training data less reliable than simulation data, our preliminary training and testing results still achieved a reasonable consistency with industrial data, suggesting that the surrogate models are directly implementable in the glass-manufacturing industry.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Finance: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.</description>
