      <title>Object-AVEdit: An Object-level Audio-Visual Editing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically, object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities, while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved advanced performance. More results on our project page: https://gewu-lab.github.io/Object_AVEdit-website/.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Musical Symbolism in Online Communities: Content-Based and Network-Centric Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness, liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and (iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 -&gt; 58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -&gt; 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51); danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| &lt; 0.20). Lyric tokenization (&gt;114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&amp;B exhibits the highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70), whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure, lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or community-level diffusion studies.</description>

      <title>Variable Rate Image Compression via N-Gram Context based Swin-transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as manufacturing and industrial vision systems.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing, as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis, diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions, dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM design considerations. Our code is available at: https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.</description>

      <title>Make a Video Call with LLM: A Measurement Campaign over Five Mainstream Apps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2025, Large Language Model (LLM) services have launched a new feature -- AI video chat -- allowing users to interact with AI agents via real-time video communication (RTC), just like chatting with real people. Despite its significance, no systematic study has characterized the performance of existing AI video chat systems. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark with carefully designed metrics across four dimensions: quality, latency, internal mechanisms, and system overhead. Using custom testbeds, we further evaluate five mainstream AI video chatbots with this benchmark. This work provides the research community a baseline of real-world performance and identifies unique system bottlenecks. In the meantime, our benchmarking results also open up several research questions for future optimizations of AI video chatbots.</description>

      <title>Disc-Cover Complexity Trends in Music Illustrations from Sinatra to Swift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of art evolution has provided valuable insights into societal change, often revealing long-term patterns of simplification and transformation. Album covers represent a distinctive yet understudied form of visual art that has both shaped and been shaped by cultural, technological, and commercial dynamics over the past century. As highly visible artifacts at the intersection of art and commerce, they offer a unique lens through which to study cultural evolution. In this work, we examine the visual complexity of album covers spanning 75 years and 11 popular musical genres. Using a diverse set of computational measures that capture multiple dimensions of visual complexity, our analysis reveals a broad shift toward minimalism across most genres, with notable exceptions that highlight the heterogeneity of aesthetic trends. At the same time, we observe growing variance over time, with many covers continuing to display high levels of abstraction and intricacy. Together, these findings position album covers as a rich, quantifiable archive of cultural history and underscore the value of computational approaches in the systematic study of the arts, bridging quantitative analysis with aesthetic and cultural inquiry.</description>

      <title>POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision. Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame, Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot in TVQA.</description>

      <title>Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.</description>

      <title>HR-INR: Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution via Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) aims to simultaneously enhance video resolution and frame rate at an arbitrary scale. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration, representing videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary scale. However, existing INR-based C-STVSR methods typically rely on only two frames as input, leading to insufficient inter-frame motion information. Consequently, they struggle to capture fast, complex motion and long-term dependencies (spanning more than three frames), hindering their performance in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel C-STVSR framework, named HR-INR, which captures both holistic dependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event camera -- a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low latency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design a feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor -- taking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation to capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature extractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion. We then propose a novel INR-based decoder with spatiotemporal embeddings to capture long-term dependencies with a larger temporal perception field. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method on four datasets (both simulated and real data), showing the superiority of our method.

      <title>DPDETR: Decoupled Position Detection Transformer for Infrared-Visible Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection aims to achieve robust object detection by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible image pairs. However, the commonly existing modality misalignment problem presents two challenges: fusing misalignment complementary features is difficult, and current methods cannot reliably locate objects in both modalities under misalignment conditions. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Position Detection Transformer (DPDETR) to address these issues. Specifically, we explicitly define the object category, visible modality position, and infrared modality position to enable the network to learn the intrinsic relationships and output reliably positions of objects in both modalities. To fuse misaligned object features reliably, we propose a Decoupled Position Multispectral Cross-attention module that adaptively samples and aggregates multispectral complementary features with the constraint of infrared and visible reference positions. Additionally, we design a query-decoupled Multispectral Decoder structure to address the the conflict in feature focus among the three kinds of object information in our task and propose a Decoupled Position Contrastive DeNoising Training strategy to enhance the DPDETR's ability to learn decoupled positions. Experiments on DroneVehicle and KAIST datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gjj45/DPDETR</description>

      <title>Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Balancing Multimodal Training Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.</description>

      <title>BlobCtrl: Taming Controllable Blob for Element-level Image Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As user expectations for image editing continue to rise, the demand for flexible, fine-grained manipulation of specific visual elements presents a challenge for current diffusion-based methods. In this work, we present BlobCtrl, a framework for element-level image editing based on a probabilistic blob-based representation. Treating blobs as visual primitives, BlobCtrl disentangles layout from appearance, affording fine-grained, controllable object-level manipulation. Our key contributions are twofold: (1) an in-context dual-branch diffusion model that separates foreground and background processing, incorporating blob representations to explicitly decouple layout and appearance, and (2) a self-supervised disentangle-then-reconstruct training paradigm with an identity-preserving loss function, along with tailored strategies to efficiently leverage blob-image pairs. To foster further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that BlobCtrl achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of element-level editing tasks, such as object addition, removal, scaling, and replacement, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First, we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator. Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs.</description>
