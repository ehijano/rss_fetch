      <title>Quantum advantage from random geometrically-two-local Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical hardness-of-sampling results are largely established for random quantum circuits, whereas analog simulators natively realize time evolutions under geometrically local Hamiltonians. Does a typical such Hamiltonian already yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization, necessitating only course-grained control.
  We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation distance, under control. We dispense with this step.
  Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation, reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.</description>

      <title>Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise.
  Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Pure Quantum Polynomial Hierarchy and Quantified Hamiltonian Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several new results concerning the pure quantum polynomial hierarchy (pureQPH). First, we show that QMA(2) is contained in pureQSigma2, that is, two unentangled existential provers can be simulated by competing existential and universal provers. We further prove that pureQSigma2 is contained in QSigma3, which in turn is contained in NEXP.
  Second, we give an error reduction result for pureQPH, and, as a consequence, prove that pureQPH = QPH. A key ingredient in this result is an improved dimension-independent disentangler.
  Finally, we initiate the study of quantified Hamiltonian complexity, the quantum analogue of quantified Boolean formulae. We prove that the quantified pure sparse Hamiltonian problem is pureQSigma-complete. By contrast, other natural variants (pure/local, mixed/local, and mixed/sparse) admit nontrivial containments but fail to be complete under known techniques. For example, we show that the exists-forall mixed local Hamiltonian problem lies in NP^QMA \cap coNP^QMA.</description>

      <title>Trickle-down Theorems via C-Lorentzian Polynomials II: Pairwise Spectral Influence and Improved Dobrushin's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement and free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</description>

      <title>Reconquering Bell sampling on qudits: stabilizer learning and testing, quantum pseudorandomness bounds, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d &gt; 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of the homology problem with orientable filtration: MA-completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain subclass of simplicial complexes. The problem is defined through a new concept of orientability of simplicial complexes that we call a "uniform orientable filtration", which is related to sign-problem freeness in homology. The containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>MIPco=coRE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [ArXiv:2204.07084].
  We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost.
  Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer.
  Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols (private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value. As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$ (interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>Efficient reductions from a Gaussian source with applications to statistical-computational tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a single observation from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\theta$, we design computationally efficient procedures that can approximately generate an observation from a different target distribution $Q_{\theta}$ uniformly for all $\theta$ in a parameter set. We leverage our technique to establish reduction-based computational lower bounds for several canonical high-dimensional statistical models under widely-believed conjectures in average-case complexity. In particular, we cover cases in which:
  1. $Q_{\theta}$ is a general location model with non-Gaussian distribution, including both light-tailed examples (e.g., generalized normal distributions) and heavy-tailed ones (e.g., Student's $t$-distributions). As a consequence, we show that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussian noise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noise distributions within our class.
  2. $Q_{\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\theta)$ for a general, smooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Using this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures of linear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, and establish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalized linear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the first reduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gap in $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al. (2016). As a second application, we construct a reduction from the sparse rank-1 submatrix model to the planted submatrix model, establishing a pointwise correspondence between the phase diagrams of the two models that faithfully preserves regions of computational hardness and tractability.</description>

      <title>When quantum resources backfire: Non-gaussianity and symplectic coherence in noisy bosonic circuits</title>

Abstract: Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Covering Two-vertex Multigraphs with Semi-edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computational complexity of graph coverings, aka locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for {\em graphs with semi-edges}. The notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of local computations. In 1991, Abello, Fellows, and Stillwell asked for a classification of the computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges. Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering graph. We show some solvable cases and, in particular, completely characterize the complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs, even for bipartite ones. We remark that our new characterization results also strengthen previously known results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and they in turn apply to an infinite class of simple target graphs with at most two vertices of degree more than two. Some of the results are moreover proven in a more general setting (e.g., finding $k$-tuples of pairwise disjoint perfect matchings in regular graphs).</description>

      <title>Parallel Complexity of Depth-First-Search and Maximal path in restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Depth First Search (DFS) tree is a fundamental graph problem, whose parallel complexity is still not settled. Reif showed parallel intractability of lex-first DFS. In contrast, randomized parallel algorithms (and more recently, deterministic quasipolynomial parallel algorithms) are known for constructing a DFS tree in general (di)graphs. However a deterministic parallel algorithm for DFS in general graphs remains an elusive goal. Working towards this, a series of works gave deterministic NC algorithms for DFS in planar graphs and digraphs. We further extend these results to more general graph classes, by providing NC algorithms for (di)graphs of bounded genus, and for undirected H-minor-free graphs where H is a fixed graph with at most one crossing. For the case of (di)graphs of bounded tree-width, we further improve the complexity to a Logspace bound. Constructing a maximal path is a simpler problem (that reduces to DFS) for which no deterministic parallel bounds are known for general graphs. For planar graphs a bound of O(log n) parallel time on a CREW PRAM (thus in NC2) is known. We improve this bound to Logspace.</description>

      <title>On the (In)Approximability of the Monitoring Edge Geodetic Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the minimum \emph{Monitoring Edge Geodetic Set} (\megset) problem introduced in [Foucaud et al., CALDAM'23]: given a graph $G$, we say that an edge is monitored by a pair $u,v$ of vertices if \emph{all} shortest paths between $u$ and $v$ traverse $e$; the goal of the problem consists in finding a subset $M$ of vertices of $G$ such that each edge of $G$ is monitored by at least one pair of vertices in $M$, and $|M|$ is minimized.
  In this paper, we prove that all polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the minimum \megset problem must have an approximation ratio of $\Omega(\log n)$, unless \p = \np. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-constant inapproximability result known for this problem. We also strengthen the known \np-hardness of the problem on $2$-apex graphs by showing that the same result holds for $1$-apex graphs. This leaves open the problem of determining whether the problem remains \np-hard on planar (i.e., $0$-apex) graphs.
  On the positive side, we design an algorithm that computes good approximate solutions for hereditary graph classes that admit efficiently computable balanced separators of truly sublinear size. This immediately results in polynomial-time approximation algorithms achieving an approximation ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{4}} \sqrt{\log n})$ on planar graphs, graphs with bounded genus, and $k$-apex graphs with $k=O(n^{\frac{1}{4}})$. On graphs with bounded treewidth, we obtain an approximation ratio of $O(\log^{3/2} n)$ for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. This compares favorably with the best-known approximation algorithm for general graphs, which achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ via a simple reduction to the \textsc{Set Cover} problem.</description>

      <title>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy $\theta_0$ is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system $F(\delta, \gamma_4, \gamma_5, \gamma_6) = (\theta_0^{(4)} - \theta_0^{(5)}, \theta_0^{(5)} - \theta_0^{(6))} = 0$ with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level $g = |\theta_0|/(2\pi n)$ removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows $g = \alpha$ (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute $\theta_0$ are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL-$\alpha$ connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</description>
