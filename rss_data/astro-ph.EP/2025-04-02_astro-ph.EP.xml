      <title>Orbit, meteoroid size, and cosmic ray exposure history of the Aguas Zarcas CM2 breccia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aguas Zarcas (Costa Rica) CM2 carbonaceous chondrite fell during night time in April 2019. Security and dashboard camera video of the meteor were analyzed to provide a trajectory, lightcurve, and orbit of the meteoroid. The trajectory was near vertical, 81{\deg} steep, arriving from an ~109{\deg} (WNW) direction with apparent entry speed of 14.6 +/- 0.6 km/s. The meteoroid penetrated to ~25 km altitude (5 MPa dynamic pressure), where the surviving mass shattered, producing a flare that was detected by the Geostationary Lightning Mappers on GOES-16 and GOES-17. The cosmogenic radionuclides were analyzed in three recovered meteorites by either gamma-ray spectroscopy or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), while noble gas concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in the same fragment that was analyzed by AMS. From this, the pre-atmospheric size of the meteoroid and its cosmic-ray exposure age were determined. The studied samples came from a few cm up to 30 cm deep in an object with an original diameter of ~60 cm, that was ejected from its parent body 2.0 +/- 0.2 Ma ago. The ejected material had an argon retention age of 2.9 Ga. The object was delivered most likely by the 3:1 or 5:2 mean motion resonances and, without subsequent fragmentation, approached Earth from a low i &lt; 2.8{\deg} inclined orbit with perihelion distance q = 0.98 AU close to Earth orbit. The steep entry trajectory and high strength resulted in deep penetration in the atmosphere and a relatively large fraction of surviving mass.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's Interior with an Inverted Helium Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's gravity field observed by NASA's Juno spacecraft indicates that the density in the 10--100 GPa region is lower than one would expect from a H/He adiabat with 0.5-5x solar water abundance as has been observationally inferred in Jupiter's atmosphere, supported by the 2--4$\times$ solar enrichment in the heavy noble gases and other volatiles observed by the Galileo entry probe. Here, we assume that Jupiter's envelope harbors a radiative window at ~0.975-0.99 RJ. This outer stable layer (OSL) delays particle exchange and accelerates the cooling of the deep interior. Consequently, the He-depletion at the Mbar-level where H/He phase separation occurs would be stronger than seen in the atmosphere. We find that the inverted He-gradient across the OSL leads to atmospheric heavy element abundances that are up to dZatm=0.03 (+2x solar) higher than for adiabatic models. With an additional inverted Z-gradient, Zatm up to 3x solar is possible. Models with 1x solar Zatm have a dilute core confined to the inner 0.2-0.3 MJ (0.4-0.5 RJ), smaller than in adiabatic models. Models with 3x solar Zatm have a largely homogeneous-Z interior at 1x solar. The low observed atmospheric Ne/He ratio suggests that Ne is transported through the OSL as efficiently as He is and at an enhanced diffusivity as is characteristic of double diffusive convection. Better knowledge of the H/He-EOS in the 10--100 GPa region and of the H/He phase diagram is needed to understand Jupiter's interior structure.</description>

      <title>Review and prospects of hot exozodiacal dust research for future exo-Earth direct imaging missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot exozodiacal dust is dust in the innermost regions of planetary systems, at temperatures around 1000K to 2000K, and commonly detected by near-infrared interferometry. The phenomenon is poorly understood and has received renewed attention as a potential risk to a planned future space mission to image potentially habitable exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres (exo-Earth imaging) such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this article, we review the current understanding of hot exozodiacal dust and its implications for HWO. We argue that the observational evidence suggests that the phenomenon is most likely real and indeed caused by hot dust, although conclusive proof in particular of the latter statement is still missing. Furthermore, we find that there exists as of yet no single model that is able to successfully explain the presence of the dust. We find that it is plausible and not unlikely that large amounts of hot exozodiacal dust in a system will critically limit the sensitivity of exo-Earth imaging observations around that star. It is thus crucial to better understood the phenomenon in order to be able to evaluate the actual impact on such a mission, and current and near-future observational opportunities for acquiring the required data exist. At the same time, hot exozodiacal dust (and warm exozodiacal dust closer to a system's habitable zone) has the potential to provide important context for HWO observations of rocky, HZ planets, constraining the environment in which these planets exist and hence to determine why a detected planet may be capable to sustain life or not.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Planet populations on Stellar Mass and Metallicity: A Pebble Accretion-based Planet Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of planetary systems are linked to their host stellar environment. In this study, we employ a pebble accretion-based planet population synthesis model to explore the correlation between planetary properties and stellar mass/metallicity. Our numerical results reproduce several main aspects of exoplanetary observations. First, we find that the occurrence rate of super-Earths $\eta_{\rm SE}$ follows an inverted V-shape in relation to stellar mass: it increases with stellar mass among lower-mass dwarfs, peaks at early-M dwarfs, and declines toward higher-mass GK stars. Second, super-Earths grow ubiquitously around stars with various metallicities, exhibiting a flat or weak $\eta_{\rm SE}$ dependence on $Z_{\star}$. Third, giant planets, in contrast, form more frequently around stars with higher-mass/metallicity. Lastly, we extend a subset of simulations to $1$ Gyr to investigate the long-term evolution of the systems' architecture. By converting our simulated systems into synthetic observations, we find that the eccentricities and inclinations of single-transit systems increase with stellar metallicity, while these dependencies in multi-planet systems remains relatively weak. The alignment between our results and observations provides key insights into the connection between planet populations and stellar properties.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry and Dynamical Constraints in 2-Limbs Retrieval of WASP-39 b Inferring from JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.</description>

      <title>Secular brightness curves of 272 comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the brightening behavior of long-period comets as a function of dynamical age, defined by the original reciprocal semimajor axis, $1/a_0$. Our goal is to test long-standing claims about comet behavior using a large number of available measurements. We use a large set of photometric observations to compute and analyze global and local brightening curves for 272 long-period comets. Observed magnitudes are fitted with a linear model in log heliocentric distance, from which we derive brightening parameters for each comet. We categorize the sample into dynamically new, intermediate, and old comets, comparing their brightening behavior. We also examine the relationships between dynamical age and other orbital and physical parameters. Dynamically new comets are seen to brighten more slowly than old comets, particularly within 3 au from the Sun. The brightening rate of new comets appears to vary with heliocentric distance. New comets are intrinsically brighter than old comets, and exhibit a tighter correlation between brightening parameters.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Geminid Models with the PSP/WISPR-observed Phaethon Dust Trail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White-light observations from the WISPR instrument on NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently revealed the presence of a narrow, dense dust trail close to the orbit of asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Although Geminid-related, it aligns imperfectly with Phaethon's orbit and known Geminid meteoroid orbits. To address the nature of this dust trail, we performed a detailed comparison between the WISPR trail observations and several well-developed Geminid models. Simulating these models in the WISPR field of view visually demonstrates that the WISPR trail almost certainly represents the true ``density core'' of the Geminid stream. Trends in model trail width and offset from Phaethon's orbit, both as functions of true anomaly, agree with observations to varying extents. All the models, however, place their apparent core interior to the parent orbit due to Poynting-Robertson forces, contradictory to the WISPR trail which is exterior to Phaethon's orbit. Therefore, Phaethon's current orbit likely does not represent the orbit of the system parent, which most probably had a larger semi-major axis. These findings provide new initial conditions for future Geminid models, with WISPR identifying the Geminid core's position.</description>

      <title>XUE. Thermochemical Modeling Suggests a Compact and Gas-Depleted Structure for a Distant, Irradiated Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the physical structure of protoplanetary disk is crucial for interpreting the diversity of the exoplanet population. Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking. We use the thermochemical code ProDiMo to model JWST/MIRI spectroscopy and archival visual/near-infrared photometry aiming to constrain the physical structure of the irradiated disk around the solar-mass star XUE 1 in NGC 6357 ($d \approx 1690$ pc). Our findings are: (1) Mid-infrared dust emission features are explained by amorphous and crystalline silicates with compositions similar to nearby disks. (2) The molecular features detected with MIRI originate within the first $\sim 1$ au, consistent with slab models' results. (3) Our model favors a disk truncated at $10$ au with a gas-to-dust ratio of unity in the outskirts. (4) Comparing models of the same disk structure under different irradiation levels, we find that strong external irradiation raises gas temperature tenfold and boosts water abundance beyond $10$ au by a factor of $100$. Our findings suggest the inner disk resists external irradiation, retaining the elements necessary for planet formation.</description>

      <title>NEOWISE Data Processing and Color Corrections for Near-Earth Asteroid Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and NEOWISE missions are a key source of thermal data for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). These missions, which utilized a space-based platform in Earth orbit, produced thermal images across four different wavelength bands, W1 - W4, with effective wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {\mu}m respectively. Despite its use for NEA observations though, the mission architecture was originally designed to observe stars. Thus, careful data analysis methods are crucial when working with NEA data to account for the differences between these objects. However, detailed information on how to work with these data can be difficult to find for users unfamiliar with the mission. The required information is well documented, but locating it can be challenging, and many details, such as specifics about color corrections, are not fully explained. Therefore, in this work, we provide a set of "lessons learned" for working with NEOWISE data, outline the basics of how to retrieve and process NEOWISE data for NEA investigations, and present an empirical method for color correction determination. We highlight the importance of this process by processing data for three NEAs, finding that nearly half of all available observations should be discarded. Finally, we present simple thermal model results based on different levels of data analysis to highlight how data processing can affect model results.</description>

      <title>The climates and thermal emission spectra of prime nearby temperate rocky exoplanet targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the course of the past decade, advances in the radial velocity and transit techniques have enabled the detection of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Future observations with novel methods are required to characterize this sample of planets, especially those that are non-transiting. One proposed method is the Planetary Infrared Excess (PIE) technique, which would enable the characterization of non-transiting planets by measuring the excess infrared flux from the planet relative to the star's spectral energy distribution. In this work, we predict the efficacy of future observations using the PIE technique by potential future observatories such as the MIRECLE mission concept. To do so, we conduct a broad suite of 21 General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with ExoCAM of seven nearby habitable zone targets for three choices of atmospheric composition with varying partial pressure of CO$_2$. We then construct thermal phase curves and emission spectra by post-processing our ExoCAM GCM simulations with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that all cases have distinguishable carbon dioxide and water features assuming a 90$^\circ$ orbital inclination. Notably, we predict that CO$_2$ is potentially detectable at 15 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ with MIRECLE for at least four nearby known non-transiting rocky planet candidate targets in the habitable zone: Proxima Cenaturi b, GJ 1061 d, GJ 1002 b, and Teegarden's Star c. Our ExoCAM GCMs and PSG post-processing demonstrate the potential to observationally characterize nearby non-transiting rocky planets and better constrain the potential for habitability in our Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXI: Limited role of streamers in mass supply to the disk in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16544-1604</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric and narrow infalling structures, often called streamers, have been observed in several Class 0/I protostars, which is not expected in the classical star formation picture. Their origin and impact on the disk formation remain observationally unclear. By combining data from the James Cleark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we investigate the physical properties of the streamers and parental dense core in the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 16544$-$1604. Three prominent streamers associated to the disk with lengths between 2800 to 5800 au, are identified on the northern side of the protostar in the C$^{18}$O emission. Their mass and mass infalling rates are estimated to be in the range of (1-4)$\times$10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ and (1-5)$\times$10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Infall signatures are also observed in the more diffuse extended protostellar envelope observed with the ALMA from the comparison to the infalling and rotating envelope model. The parental dense core detected by the JCMT observation has a mass of $\sim$0.5 $M_\odot$, sub to transonic turbulence of $\mathcal{M}$ $=$ 0.8-1.1, and a mass-to-flux ratio of 2-6. Our results show that the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 only possess 2% of the entire dense core mass and contribute less than 10% of the mass infalling rate of the protostellar envelope. Therefore, the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 play a minor role in the mass accretion process onto the disk, in contrast to those streamers observed in other sources and those formed in numerical simulations of collapsing dense cores with similar turbulence and magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Science Autonomy using Machine Learning for Astrobiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) have become vital for space missions enabling rapid data processing, advanced pattern recognition, and enhanced insight extraction. These tools are especially valuable in astrobiology applications, where models must distinguish biotic patterns from complex abiotic backgrounds. Advancing the integration of autonomy through AI and ML into space missions is a complex challenge, and we believe that by focusing on key areas, we can make significant progress and offer practical recommendations for tackling these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Evolution of helium triplet transits of close-in gas giants orbiting K-dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01313</link>

Abstract: Atmospheric escape in exoplanets has traditionally been observed using hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ and H-$\alpha$ transmission spectroscopy, but more recent detections have utilised the metastable helium triplet at 1083$~$nm. Since this feature is accessible from the ground, it offers new possibilities for studying atmospheric escape. Our goal is to understand how the observability of escaping helium evolves during the lifetime of a highly irradiated gas giant. We extend our previous work on 1-D self-consistent hydrodynamic escape from hydrogen-only atmospheres as a function of planetary evolution to the first evolution-focused study of escaping hydrogen-helium atmospheres. Additionally, using these novel models we perform helium triplet transmission spectroscopy. We adapt our previous hydrodynamic escape model to now account for both hydrogen and helium heating and cooling processes and simultaneously solve for the population of helium in the triplet state. To account for the planetary evolution, we utilise evolving predictions of planetary radii for a close-in 0.3$~M_{\rm Jup}$ gas giant and its received stellar flux in X-ray, hard and soft EUV, and mid-UV wavelength bins assuming a K dwarf stellar host. We find that the helium triplet signature diminishes with evolution. Our models suggest that young ($\lesssim 150$~Myr), close-in gas giants ($\sim 1$ to $2~R_{\rm Jup}$) should produce helium 1083$~$nm transit absorptions of $\sim 4\%$ or $\sim 7\%$, for a slow or fast-rotating K dwarf, respectively, assuming a 2$\%$ helium abundance.</description>

      <title>Near-instantaneous Atmospheric Retrievals and Model Comparison with FASTER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.</description>

      <title>A Refined Cometary Fluorescence Model for the $\nu_{3}$ Vibrational Band of Cyanogen : Application to JWST/NIRSPEC Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyanogen ($C_2N_2$) was among the many molecules identified in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Rosetta mission. As a potential parent species of the CN radical, its abundance relative to other species such as HCN should be generalized to comets observed from ground-based facilities. To investigate its presence from infrared spectra in other comets, we developed a new fluorescence model for the $\nu_3$ fundamental band. From new high-resolution infrared spectra of cyanogen, we analyzed the region of the $\nu_3$ band of $C_2N_2$, centered around 4.63 $\mu$m 2158 cm$^{-1}$). In addition to line positions and intensities, ground and excited molecular parameters were obtained. The spectroscopic analysis allowed us to develop a new fluorescence model for cyanogen. Excitation rates of the $\nu_3$ band of cyanogen are presented. An attempt to detect cyanogen in a high-resolution spectrum of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Two-component Model of the 'spokes' in Saturn's Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spokes observed in Saturn's rings have been a subject of scientific debate since their discovery by Stephen J. O'Meara in the 1970s and their confirmation by the Voyager flybys in the early 1980s (Smith et al., 1982). While the Cassini spacecraft confirmed that the spokes are linked to Saturn's magnetosphere, their exact formation mechanism remains uncertain. This paper proposes that the spokes in Saturn's rings consist of two distinct components: (1) carbonaceous materials, namely pyrolytic carbon with diamagnetic properties and potentially other various forms of carbon-bearing compounds, which persist over longer timescales, and (2) rapidly forming and dissipating diamagnetic ice grains, which interact with Saturn's magnetosphere on much shorter timescales. We suggest that the spokes consist of diamagnetic pyrolytic carbon that has coated silicates through the process of high-temperature Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) during the formation of Saturn's protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the spokes consist of diamagnetic ice particles that can disappear within minutes to hours due to sublimation. The photoelectric effect causes the pyrolytic carbon grains to lose electrons, thus becoming paramagnetic, which results in their attraction back to the main B ring structure. We suggest that Saturn's rings are charged by the solar wind, generating a magnetic field that emanates orthogonally above and below the B ring plane due to the movement of charged particles in the rings. Statistical analysis of Cassini data reveals significant correlations between spoke activity and both Saturn's magnetospheric rotation and solar elevation angle, providing strong support for an electromagnetic mechanism in spoke formation. This hypothesis suggests that the visibility of the spokes is dictated by illumination conditions and electromagnetic effects.</description>
