      <title>Chaotic interaction between thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous study [1], we proposed a new physical law applicable to both particle and thermodynamical systems. Additionally, we introduced a physical definition of chaos and self-organization. In the present work, we extend this novel interaction scheme to various thermodynamical systems in order to test the universality of the proposed law. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of these systems also exhibit chaotic behavior under different conditions. We discussed the relationship between chaotic dynamics and the least action, and for the first time, we proposed the "Chaotic Action Principle" (CAP). Furthermore, we examined the validity of the physical and philosophical foundations of this new law and the associated definition of chaos. Finally, based on CAP, we proposed a new conceptual definition of complexity.</description>

      <title>Criticality of a stochastic modern Hopfield network model with exponential interaction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network (HN) is a classical model of associative memory whose dynamics are closely related to the Ising spin system with 2-body interactions. Stored patterns are encoded as minima of an energy function shaped by a Hebbian learning rule, and retrieval corresponds to convergence towards these minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) introduce p-body interactions among neurons with p greater than 2 and, more recently, also exponential interaction functions, which significantly improve network's storing and retrieval capacity. While the criticality of HNs and p-body MHNs were extensively studied since the 1980s, the investigation of critical behavior in exponential MHNs is still in its early stages. Here, we study a stochastic exponential MHN (SMHN) with a multiplicative salt-and-pepper noise. While taking the noise probability p as control parameter, the average overlap parameter Q and a diffusion scaling H are taken as order parameters. In particular, H is related to the time correlation features of the network, with H greater than 0.5 signaling the emergence of persistent time memory. We found the emergence of a critical transition in both Q and H, with the critical noise level weakly decreasing as the load N increases. Notably, for each load N, the diffusion scaling H highlights a transition between a sub- and a super-critical regime, both with short-range correlated dynamics. Conversely, the critical regime, which is found in the range of p around 0.23-0.3, displays a long-range correlated dynamics with highly persistent temporal memory marked by the high value H around 1.3.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of homoclinic bursting: an approach using infinite-modal maps toward predicting extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems is challenging due to a limited understanding of their statistical properties. This study numerically and theoretically investigates the statistical properties of infinite-modal maps arising from homoclinic bursting to predict extreme events. The numerical investigation presents bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, height probability distributions, and interevent interval probability distributions for infinite-modal maps. The theoretical analysis derives analytical formulae for these statistical properties using a randomization theory of infinite-modal maps. Furthermore, a parameter estimation method for infinite-modal maps is proposed, utilizing the derived analytical formula, which enables practical application of the theoretical results. Finally, the study demonstrates the applicability of the approach in analyzing non-stationary data with time-dependent parameters. These findings provide a foundation for the prediction of extreme events based on their mechanism.</description>

      <title>How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>
