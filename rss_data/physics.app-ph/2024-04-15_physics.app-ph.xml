      <title>Nonlinear Wave-Spin Interactions in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear phenomena represent one of the central topics in the study of wave-matter interactions and constitute the key blocks for various applications in optical communication, computing, sensing, and imaging. In this work, we show that by employing the interactions between microwave photons and electron spins of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, one can realize a variety of nonlinear effects, ranging from the resonance at the sum or difference frequency of two or more waves to electromagnetically induced transparency from the interference between spin transitions. We further verify the phase coherence through two-photon Rabi-oscillation measurements. The highly sensitive, optically detected NV-center dynamics not only provides a platform for studying magnetically induced nonlinearities but also promises novel functionalities in quantum control and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Wave-Freezing and other Phenomena in Temporal Metasurfaces driven by Nonlocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time metamaterials, or materials with properties changing in space and time, have gained a wide-spread interest due to their exotic properties. In this Letter, we propose a novel temporal metasurface of phononic crystals in one and two-dimensions, that combines the use of nonlocal interactions in phononic crystals to customize dispersion relations, and the use of temporal interfaces to transition from a local material to a nonlocal material and vice-versa, to achieve the interesting phenomenon of \textit{wave-freezing}, where the entire propagating wave is stopped without diffusing or spreading. The phononic crystals are modeled using spring-mass systems and we use finite difference calculations to present our numerical results. We also demonstrate other effects observed in such temporal metasurfaces, such as time-reversed waves, and anomalous temporal refraction.</description>

      <title>Achieving High Yield of Perpendicular SOT-MTJ Manufactured on 300 mm Wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale fabrication of three-terminal magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with high yield is becoming increasingly crucial, especially with the growing interest in spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic random access memory (MRAM) as the next generation of MRAM technology. To achieve high yield and consistent device performance in MTJs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, an integration flow has been developed that incorporates special MTJ etching technique and other CMOS-compatible processes on a 300 mm wafer manufacturing platform. Systematic studies have been conducted on device performance and statistical uniformity, encompassing magnetic properties, electrical switching behavior, and reliability. Achievements include a switching current of 680 uA at 2 ns, a TMR as high as 119%, ultra-high endurance (over 1012 cycles), and excellent uniformity in the fabricated SOT-MTJ devices, with a yield of up to 99.6%. The proposed integration process, featuring high yield, is anticipated to streamline the mass production of SOT-MRAM.</description>

      <title>Topological rainbow trapping and broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting of acoustic waves in gradient phononic crystals with coupled interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phononic crystals (PCs) offer a novel approach to control the behavior of acoustic or elastic waves. In this paper, we design the gradient PC structures with coupled interfaces to realize topological rainbow trapping and broadband acoustic energy harvesting. Based on the geometric symmetry of PC unit cells, we construct the coupled topological interfaces by amalgamating two PCs with distinct topological phases. Also, the gradient modulation of structural parameters along the coupled interfaces is employed for the generation of rainbow trapping. Subsequently, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is mounted along the coupled interfaces of the gradient PC structures, facilitating the conversion of acoustic energy into electrical energy. The numerical and experimental results show that the acoustic waves at different frequencies stop and are amplified at different positions of the coupled interfaces. Compared with the harvester in a bare structure, the topological PC energy harvester significantly enhances the output power at different excited frequencies. In the experiments, the maximum amplification ratio of the output power reaches 91. Besides, it is demonstrated that the topological rainbow trapping of acoustic waves exhibits robustness against random structural disorders. Notably, the coupled interfaces have broadband and multi-mode features, which are promising for other applications such as selective filtering and sensing enhancement.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Restructuring of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) holds promise as a solid state, van der Waals host of single photon emitters for on-chip quantum photonics. The B-centre defect emitting at 436 nm is particularly compelling as it can be generated by electron beam irradiation. However, the emitter generation mechanism is unknown, the robustness of the method is variable, and it has only been applied successfully to thick flakes of hBN (&gt;&gt; 10 nm). Here, we use in-situ time-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of B-centre generation. We show that the generation of B-centres is accompanied by quenching of a carbon-related emission at ~305 nm and that both processes are rate-limited by electromigration of defects in the hBN lattice. We identify problems that limit the efficacy and reproducibility of the emitter generation method, and solve them using a combination of optimized electron beam parameters and hBN pre- and post-processing treatments. We achieve B-centre quantum emitters in hBN flakes as thin as 8 nm, elucidate the mechanisms responsible for electron beam restructuring of quantum emitters in hBN, and gain insights towards identification of the atomic structure of the B-centre quantum emitter.</description>

      <title>On the experimental properties of the TS defect in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When annealing a 4H silicon carbide (SiC) crystal, a sequence of optically active defect centers occurs among which the TS center is a prominent example. Here, we present low-temperature photoluminescence analyses on the single defect level. They reveal that the three occurring spectral signatures TS1, TS2 and TS3 originate from one single defect. Their polarization dependences expose three different crystallographic orientations in the basal plane, which relate to the projections of the nearest neighbor directions. Accordingly, we find a three-fold level-splitting in ensemble studies, when applying mechanical strain. This dependency is quantitatively calibrated. A complementary electrical measurement, deep level transient spectroscopy, reveals a charge transition level of the TS defect at 0.6 eV above the valence band. For a future identification, this accurate characterization of its optical and electronic properties along with their response to mechanical strain is a milestone.</description>

      <title>MAM-STM: A software for autonomous control of single moieties towards specific surface positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this publication we introduce MAM-STM, a software to autonomously manipulate arbitrary moieties towards specific positions on a metal surface utilizing the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Finding the optimal manipulation parameters for a specific moiety is challenging and time consuming, even for human experts. MAM-STM combines autonomous data acquisition with a sophisticated Q-learning implementation to determine the optimal bias voltage, the z-approach distance, and the tip position relative to the moiety. This then allows to arrange single molecules and atoms at will. In this work, we provide a tutorial based on a simulated response to offer a comprehensive explanation on how to use and customize MAM-STM. Additionally, we assess the performance of the machine learning algorithm by benchmarking it within a simulated stochastic environment.</description>

      <title>Martensite decomposition kinetics in additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy: in-situ characterisation and phase-field modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy via laser powder-bed fusion leads to non-equilibrium $\alpha'$ martensitic microstructures, with high strength but poor ductility and toughness. These properties may be modified by heat treatments, whereby the $\alpha'$ phase decomposes into equilibrium $\alpha+\beta$ structures, while possibly conserving microstructural features and length scales of the $\alpha'$ lath structure. Here, we combine experimental and computational methods to explore the kinetics of martensite decomposition. Experiments rely on in-situ characterisation (electron microscopy and diffraction) during multi-step heat treatment from 400$^{\circ}$C up to the alloy $\beta$-transus temperature (995$^{\circ}$C). Computational simulations rely on an experimentally-informed computationally-efficient phase-field model. Experiments confirmed that as-built microstructures were fully composed of martensitic $\alpha'$ laths. During martensite decomposition, nucleation of the $\beta$ phase occurs primarily along $\alpha'$ lath boundaries, with traces of $\beta$ nucleation along crystalline defects. Phase-field results, using electron backscatter diffraction maps of as-built microstructures as initial conditions, are compared directly with in-situ characterisation data. Experiments and simulations confirmed that, while full decomposition into stable $\alpha+\beta$ phases may be complete at 650$^{\circ}$C provided sufficient annealing time, visible morphological evolution of the microstructure was only observed for $T\geq\,$700$^{\circ}$C, without modification of the prior-$\beta$ grain structure.</description>

      <title>Note: Applying the Brillouin Zone and Band Gap Leveraging AB Initio Calculation for Digital Well-Being: In-Depth Analysis of Band Structures in Information Spaces Insights from Solid-State Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efforts of this Note are aimed at understanding various phenomena in digital space that are incomplete and difficult to define, and to translate them into language from research fields that are based on existing large-scale experimental data. Information diffusion and user behavior patterns in digital space are often hard to intuitively capture, and the principles and mechanisms behind them are difficult to articulate. To address this challenge, we have drawn on first-principles methods in physics, particularly solid state physics. This approach is known to be effective in analyzing the behavior of real physical materials at the atomic level and in understanding the electronic properties and bonding structures of materials. We have attempted to apply physical concepts based on first-principles calculations, in particular concepts such as first Brillouin zones, band gaps, and reciprocal lattice vectors, to digital space as a metaphor. This theoretical framework allows us to quantitatively and logically infer the behavior and trends of incomplete and ambiguous digital data and phenomena. For example, the "first Brillouin zone" of information in digital media indicates the potential sphere of influence of that information, and the band gap defines the threshold of influence for the information to be widely accepted. In addition, the reciprocal lattice vector serves as a boundary that indicates the limits of information characteristics and is an indicator of the degree to which a particular piece of information resonates with users. With this theoretical supplement, our research goes beyond the mere analysis of phenomena in the digital space and provides new methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of imperfect data and uncertain digital media.</description>

      <title>Analysis of growth of silicon thin films on textured and non-textured surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon alloy films are generally deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD) technique on various types of substrates. Generally it is assumed that film quality remains unchanged when deposited on textured or non-textured substrates. Here we analyzed the difference in growth of thin film silicon layers when deposited in a textured and a non-textured surface. In this investigation characteristics of two solar cells were compared, where one cell was prepared on a textured surface ( Cell-A) while the other prepared on a non-textured surface (Cell-B). Defect analysis of the devices were carried out by simulation and device modeling. It shows that the intrinsic film deposited on a textured surface was more defective ($2.4\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$) than that deposited on a flat surface ($3.2\times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$). Although the primary differences in these two cells were thickness of the active layer and nature of surface texturing, the simulation results show that thin film deposited on a textured surface may acquire an increased defect density than that deposited on a flat surface. Lower effective flux density of $SiH_{3}$ precursors on the textured surface can be one of the reasons for higher defect density in the film deposited on textured surface. An Improved light coupling can be achieved by using a thinner doped window layer. By changing the thickness from 15 nm to 3 nm, the short circuit current density increased from 16.4 mA/cm$^{2}$ to 20.96 mA/cm$^{2}$ and efficiency increased from $9.4\%$ to $12.32\%$.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared 2D nonredundant optical phased array of mirror emitters in an InGaAs/InP platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extension of photonic technologies such as lidar and free-space optical communications from the traditional visible and near-infrared wavelengths to longer wavelengths can improve performance in adverse environments such as haze, fog, smoke, or strong solar background. Non-mechanical beam steerers will be a critical component of the low size, weight, and power modules needed for the portable or unmanned systems deployed in these environments. In this work, we demonstrate the first 2D optical phased array for non-mechanical beam steering in the mid-infrared spectral region. We combine a total internal-reflection mirror emitter with a non-redundant array of 30 elements to carry out 2D beam steering at a single wavelength of 4.6 $\mu$m. The experiment yielded 600 resolvable far-field points, with 2400 points over a $28^\circ \times 28^\circ$ field of view calculated theoretically. Moreover, the device was fabricated in a passive InGaAs/InP platform, contributing another advance in the ongoing development of quantum cascade laser-based photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Image Scanning Microscopy Reconstruction by Autocorrelation Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) stands out as one of the most widely used microscopy techniques, thanks to its three-dimensional imaging capability and its sub-diffraction spatial resolution, achieved through the closure of a pinhole in front of a single-element detector. However, the pinhole also rejects useful photons and beating the diffraction limit comes at the price of irremediably compromising the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Image scanning microscopy (ISM) emerged as the natural evolution of CLSM, exploiting a small array detector in place of the pinhole and the single-element detector. Each sensitive element is small enough to achieve sub-diffraction resolution through the confocal effect, but the size of the whole detector is large enough to guarantee excellent collection efficiency and SNR. However, the raw data produced by an ISM setup consists of a 4D dataset which can be seen as a set of confocal-like images. Thus, fusing the dataset into a single super-resolved image requires a dedicated reconstruction algorithm. Conventional methods are multi-image deconvolution, which requires prior knowledge of the system point spread functions (PSF), or adaptive pixel reassignment (APR), which is effective only on a limited range of experimental conditions. In this work, we describe and validate a novel concept for ISM image reconstruction based on autocorrelation inversion. We leverage unique properties of the autocorrelation to discard low-frequency components and maximize the resolution of the reconstructed image, without any assumption on the image or any knowledge of the PSF. Our results push the quality of the ISM reconstruction beyond the level provided by APR and open new perspectives for multi-dimensional image processing.</description>

      <title>Influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics in InGaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of hot carrier relaxation in nanowires (NWs) with one-dimensional (1D) geometry is significant for designing efficient hot carrier solar cells with such nanostructures. Here, we study the influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics of catalyst-free InGaAs-InAlAs core-shell NWs. Using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy the dependencies of hot carrier effects on the degree of confinement of photo-generated carriers induced by the nanowire diameter are determined at different lattice temperatures. Analysis of excitation-power dependent data and temperature-dependent PL linewidth broadening reveal that at low temperatures, strong Auger recombination and phonon-bottleneck are responsible for hot carrier effects. Our analysis gives also insights into electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, showing opposing trends with NW diameter, and it allows to estimate the Fr\"ohlich coupling constant for the InGaAs NWs. Conversely, with increasing lattice temperature, hot carrier relaxation rates increase due to enhanced Shockley-Read Hall and surface recombination. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a fourfold increase in the rate of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination from 6 ns at 10 K to 1.5 ns at 150 K. The findings suggest that minimizing defect densities in the bulk and surfaces of these NWs will be key to enhance hot carrier effects towards higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of magnetic systems by quantized surface acoustic wave via piezomagnetic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantized surface acoustic wave (SAW) in the piezoelectric medium has recently been studied, and is used to control electric dipoles of quantum systems via the electric field produced through piezoelectric effect. However, it is not easy and convenient to manipulate magnetic moments directly by the electric field. We here study a quantum theory of SAW in the piezomagnetic medium. We show that the intrinsic properties of the piezomagnetic medium enable the SAW in the piezomagnetic medium to directly interact with magnetic moments of quantum systems via magnetic field induced by piezomagnetic effect. By taking the strip SAW waveguide made of piezomagnetic medium as an example, we further study the coupling strengths between different magnetic quantum systems with magnetic moments and the quantized single-mode SAW in the waveguide. Based on this, we discuss the interaction between magnetic quantum systems mediated by the quantized multi-mode SAW in piezomagnetic waveguide. Our study provides a convenient way to directly control magnetic quantum systems by quantized SAW, and offers potential applications to on-chip information processing based on solid-state quantum systems via quantized acoustic wave.</description>

Abstract: A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output at a different frequency, while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity. When operating between the microwave and optical frequencies, it is crucial for quantum networking between quantum computers via low-loss optical links, and thereby enabling distributed quantum computing. However, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer from low transduction efficiency due to weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency leads to inevitable thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product in such systems is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To resolve the conundrum, we propose to boost the transduction efficiency by consuming entanglement within the same frequency band (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak nonlinear coupling, which establishes a high-fidelity quantum communication link without any signal encoding. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Architected materials with their unique topology and geometry offer the potential to modify physical and mechanical properties. Machine learning can accelerate the design and optimization of these materials by identifying optimal designs and forecasting performance. This work presents LatticeML, a data-driven application for predicting the effective Young's Modulus of high-temperature graph-based architected materials. The study considers eleven graph-based lattice structures with two high-temperature alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625. Finite element simulations were used to compute the effective Young's Modulus of the 2x2x2 unit cell configurations. A machine learning framework was developed to predict Young's Modulus, involving data collection, preprocessing, implementation of regression models, and deployment of the best-performing model. Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated, with the XGBoost Regressor achieving the highest accuracy (MSE = 2.7993, MAE = 1.1521, R-squared = 0.9875). The application uses the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web interface, allowing users to input material and geometric parameters and obtain predicted Young's Modulus values.</description>

      <title>Transmission efficiency limit of single-switch and cascaded reconfigurable transmitarray elements</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable transmitarray antennas (RTAs) are rapidly gaining popularity, but optimizing their performance requires systematic design theories. In particular, establishing a performance limit theory for RTA elements is valuable. This paper presents a transmission efficiency limit theory for single-switch RTA elements and their cascaded extensions. Employing microwave network analysis, we analytically investigate single-switch RTA elements, demonstrating that their transmission coefficients under two states must lie on or within a specific unit circle on the Smith chart. Therefore, the transmission phase difference is tightly constrained by the transmission amplitudes, indicating that the phase-shifting ability of a single-switch RTA element is limited. Subsequently, this analysis is extended to cascaded RTA elements. By cascading several single-switch layers, the phase variation range is extended, enabling the realization of 1-bit phase shifts with high transmission amplitudes. These findings have significant impact on the design and optimization of RTA elements.</description>

      <title>Universal Murray's law for optimised fluid transport in synthetic structures</title>

Abstract: Materials following Murray's law are of significant interest due to their unique porous structure and optimal mass transfer ability. However, it is challenging to construct such biomimetic hierarchical channels with perfectly cylindrical pores in synthetic systems following the existing theory. Achieving superior mass transport capacity revealed by Murray's law in nanostructured materials has thus far remained out of reach. We propose a Universal Murray's law applicable to a wide range of hierarchical structures, shapes and generalised transfer processes. We experimentally demonstrate optimal flow of various fluids in hierarchically planar and tubular graphene aerogel structures to validate the proposed law. By adjusting the macroscopic pores in such aerogel-based gas sensors, we also show a significantly improved sensor response dynamic. Our work provides a solid framework for designing synthetic Murray materials with arbitrarily shaped channels for superior mass transfer capabilities, with future implications in catalysis, sensing and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Calculations of Nonlinear Susceptibility and Multi-Phonon Mixing Processes in a 2DEG-Piezoelectric Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model for Calculating Gain Pattern of Antennas Implanted in Large Host Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for the fast and accurate estimation of the gain pattern and maximum gain of an implanted antenna including the effect of the host body, under the assumption that the latter is electrically large. The estimation procedure is based on the radiation of an elementary dipole source placed in a planar body model. The derivation of closed-form expressions is based on spherical wave analysis and the Green's functions for layered media. The validity of this approximation for practical cases is shown on different implanted antennas, where the results are compared to full wave simulations and measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triangular cross-section color center photonics in silicon carbide is a leading candidate for scalable implementation of quantum hardware. Within this geometry, we model low-loss beam splitters for applications in key quantum optical operations such as entanglement and single-photon interferometry. We consider triangular cross-section single-mode waveguides for the design of a directional coupler. We optimize parameters for a 50:50 beam splitter. Finally, we test the experimental feasibility of the designs by fabricating triangular waveguides in an ion beam etching process and identify suitable designs for short-term implementation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model of Qudit Measurement for Superconducting Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions, has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits. In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates are close to the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. This thesis provides a detailed introduction to the superconducting qudit and demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of decoherence in an artificial atom with more than two levels using Lindblad master equations and stochastic master equations (SMEs). After extending the theory of the design, control, and readout of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, the thesis focuses on modeling the dispersive measurement of a transmon qutrit in an open quantum system using quadrature detections. Under the Markov assumption, master equations with different levels of abstraction are proposed and solved; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are presented and compared analytically and numerically. The thesis ends with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of the stochastic model.</description>
