      <title>Long-range dependent mortality modeling with cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical studies with publicly available life tables identify long-range dependence (LRD) in national mortality data. Although the longevity market is supposed to benchmark against the national force of mortality, insurers are more concerned about the forces of mortality associated with their own portfolios than the national ones. Recent advances on mortality modeling make use of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to capture LRD. A theoretically flexible approach even considers mixed fBm (mfBm). Using Volterra processes, we prove that the direct use of mfBm encounters the identification problem so that insurers hardly detect the LRD effect from their portfolios. Cointegration techniques can effectively bring the LRD information within the national force of mortality to the mortality models for insurers' experienced portfolios. Under the open-loop equilibrium control framework, the explicit and unique equilibrium longevity hedging strategy is derived for cointegrated forces of mortality with LRD. Using the derived hedging strategy, our numerical examples show that the accuracy of estimating cointegration is crucial for hedging against the longevity exposure of insurers with LRD national force of mortality.</description>

      <title>Liquidity-adjusted Return and Volatility, and Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely designed liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that incorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we introduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations of traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling illiquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We demonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for cryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and reduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is validated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance (LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Enterprise Financial Risk Analysis from Big Data Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enterprise financial risk analysis aims at predicting the future financial risk of enterprises. Due to its wide and significant application, enterprise financial risk analysis has always been the core research topic in the fields of Finance and Management. Based on advanced computer science and artificial intelligence technologies, enterprise risk analysis research is experiencing rapid developments and making significant progress. Therefore, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on enterprise risk analysis from the perspective of Finance and Management, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack recent advances in enterprise financial risk analysis. In contrast, this paper attempts to provide a systematic literature survey of enterprise risk analysis approaches from Big Data perspective, which reviews more than 250 representative articles in the past almost 50 years (from 1968 to 2023). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only survey work on enterprise financial risk from Big Data perspective. Specifically, this survey connects and systematizes the existing enterprise financial risk studies, i.e. to summarize and interpret the problems, methods, and spotlights in a comprehensive way. In particular, we first introduce the issues of enterprise financial risks in terms of their types,granularity, intelligence, and evaluation metrics, and summarize the corresponding representative works. Then, we compare the analysis methods used to learn enterprise financial risk, and finally summarize the spotlights of the most representative works. Our goal is to clarify current cutting-edge research and its possible future directions to model enterprise risk, aiming to fully understand the mechanisms of enterprise risk generation and contagion.</description>

      <title>The TruEnd-procedure: Treating trailing zero-valued balances in credit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of trailing zero (or very small) month-end balances. Identifying these trailing balances requires an exact definition of a "small balance", which our method informs. We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using South African residential mortgages. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model, e.g., survival analysis. Having discarded these excess histories, we demonstrably improve the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under IFRS 9. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.</description>
