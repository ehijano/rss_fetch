      <title>Antimatter Gravity and the Results of the ALPHA-g Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining general relativity and CPT symmetry, the theory of CPT gravity predicts gravitational repulsion between matter and CPT-transformed matter, i.e. antimatter inhabiting an inverted space-time. Such repulsive gravity turned out to be an excellent candidate for explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe, without the need for dark energy. The recent results of the ALPHA-g experiment, which show gravitational attraction between antihydrogen atoms and the Earth, seem to undermine this success in the cosmological field. Analyzing the above theory, we find two solutions that can be consistent with the experimental results, while preserving the large-scale gravitational repulsion. The first highlights how repulsive gravity can be the result of the interaction with an inverted space-time, but occupied by matter and not antimatter, and therefore the antimatter present in our space-time has no reason to exhibit gravitational repulsion. The second retains the original CPT transformation, resulting in repulsive gravity between matter and antimatter, but with the caveat that antimatter immersed in our space-time cannot exhibit the PT transformation which is the cause of the repulsion. Finally, it is shown that, in a Newtonian approximation of the geodesic equation, time reversal is not a necessary operation for repulsive gravity, therefore opening the possibility of an expanding cosmos with a single time direction.</description>
