      <title>Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search of Early Exiting Networks on Edge Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in high-performance computing and cloud technologies have enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated Deep Learning (DL) models. However, the growing demand for embedded intelligence at the edge imposes stringent computational and energy constraints, challenging the deployment of these large-scale models. Early Exiting Neural Networks (EENN) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing dynamic termination of inference based on input complexity to enhance efficiency. Despite their potential, EENN performance is highly influenced by the heterogeneity of edge accelerators and the constraints imposed by quantization, affecting accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Yet, research on the automatic optimization of EENN design for edge hardware remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that systematically integrates the effects of quantization and hardware resource allocation to optimize the placement of early exit points within a network backbone. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our NAS framework can discover architectures that achieve over a 50\% reduction in computational costs compared to conventional static networks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.</description>

      <title>MAX BISECTION might be harder to approximate than MAX CUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAX BISECTION problem seeks a maximum-size cut that evenly divides the vertices of a given undirected graph. An open problem raised by Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou is whether MAX BISECTION can be approximated as well as MAX CUT, i.e., to within ${\alpha_{GW}}\approx 0.8785672\ldots$, which is the approximation ratio achieved by the celebrated Goemans-Williamson algorithm for MAX CUT, which is best possible assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). They conjectured that the answer is yes.
  The current paradigm for obtaining approximation algorithms for MAX BISECTION, due to Raghavendra and Tan and Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou, follows a two-phase approach. First, a large number of rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is used to find a solution to the ``Basic SDP'' relaxation of MAX CUT which is $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated, for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Second, standard SDP rounding techniques (such as ${\cal THRESH}$) are used to round this $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution, producing with high probability a cut that is almost balanced, i.e., a cut that has at most $\frac12+\varepsilon$ fraction of the vertices on each side. This cut is then converted into an exact bisection of the graph with only a small loss.
  In this paper, we show that this two-stage paradigm cannot be used to obtain an $\alpha_{GW}$-approximation algorithm for MAX BISECTION if one relies only on the $\varepsilon$-uncorrelatedness property of the solution produced by the first phase. More precisely, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we construct an explicit instance of MAX BISECTION for which the ratio between the value of the optimal integral solution and the value of some $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution of the Basic SDP relaxation is less than $0.87853 &lt; {\alpha_{GW}}$. Our instances are also integrality gaps for the Basic SDP relaxation of MAX BISECTION.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Pseudodeterministic Construction of Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A randomized algorithm for a search problem is *pseudodeterministic* if it produces a fixed canonical solution to the search problem with high probability. In their seminal work on the topic, Gat and Goldwasser posed as their main open problem whether prime numbers can be pseudodeterministically constructed in polynomial time.
  We provide a positive solution to this question in the infinitely-often regime. In more detail, we give an *unconditional* polynomial-time randomized algorithm $B$ such that, for infinitely many values of $n$, $B(1^n)$ outputs a canonical $n$-bit prime $p_n$ with high probability. More generally, we prove that for every dense property $Q$ of strings that can be decided in polynomial time, there is an infinitely-often pseudodeterministic polynomial-time construction of strings satisfying $Q$. This improves upon a subexponential-time construction of Oliveira and Santhanam.
  Our construction uses several new ideas, including a novel bootstrapping technique for pseudodeterministic constructions, and a quantitative optimization of the uniform hardness-randomness framework of Chen and Tell, using a variant of the Shaltiel--Umans generator.</description>

      <title>PLS-complete problems with lexicographic cost functions: Max-$k$-SAT and Abelian Permutation Orbit Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How hard is it to find a local optimum? If we are given a graph and want to find a locally maximal cut--meaning that the number of edges in the cut cannot be improved by moving a single vertex from one side to the other--then just iterating improving steps finds a local maximum since the size of the cut can increase at most $|E|$ times. If, on the other hand, the edges are weighted, this problem becomes hard for the class PLS (Polynomial Local Search).
  We are interested in optimization problems with {\em lexicographic costs}. For Max-Cut this would mean that the edges $e_1,\dots, e_m$ have costs $c(e_i) = 2^{m-i}$. For such a cost function, it is easy to see that finding a {\em global} Max-Cut is easy. In contrast, we show that it is PLS-complete to find an assignment for a 4-CNF formula that is locally maximal (when the clauses have lexicographic weights); and also for a 3-CNF when we relax the notion of ``local'' by allowing to switch two variables at a time.
  We use these results to answer a question in Scheder and Tantow, who showed that finding a lexicographic local minimum of a string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$ under the action of a list of given permutations $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_k \in S_{n}$ is PLS-complete. They ask whether the problem stays PLS-complete when the $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ commute, i.e., generate an Abelian subgroup $G$ of $S_n$. In this work, we show that it does, and in fact stays PLS-complete even (1) when every element in $G$ has order two and also (2) when $G$ is cyclic, i.e., all $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_k$ are powers of a single permutation $\pi$.
  Additionally, we use it to reprove the hardness of computing an $\alpha$ approximate Nash equilibria in congestion games by Skopalik and V\"ocking and extend the result from step functions to exponential functions.</description>

      <title>Hunting a rabbit: complexity, approximability and some characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Hunters and Rabbit game, $k$ hunters attempt to shoot an invisible rabbit on a given graph $G$. In each round, the hunters select $k$ vertices to shoot at, while the rabbit moves along an edge of $G$. The hunters win if, at any point, the rabbit is shot. The hunting number of $G$, denoted $h(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that $k$ hunters have a winning strategy regardless of the rabbit's moves.
  The computational complexity of determining $h(G)$ has been one of the longest-standing open questions about the game. Our first main contribution resolves this by proving that computing $h(G)$ is NP-hard, even for bipartite simple graphs. We further show that the problem remains NP-hard even when $h(G) = O(n^{\epsilon})$ or when $n - h(G) = O(n^{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. In addition, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate $h(G)$ additively within $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$.
  When a time limit $l$ is imposed on the hunting process, we show that computing $h(G)$ remains NP-hard for any $l \ge 2$ bounded by a polynomial in $n$. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time $l$-factor approximation algorithm for computing the hunting number with time limit $l$, and we show that $h(G)$ can be computed in polynomial time for bipartite graphs when only two time slots are allowed ($l = 2$).
  Finally, we provide a forbidden-subgraph characterization of graphs with loops that satisfy $h(G) = 1$, extending a known characterization for simple graphs.</description>
