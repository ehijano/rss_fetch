      <title>Competition for binding targets results in paradoxical effects for simultaneous activator and repressor action -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of epigenetic transformations in cancer metastasis, a puzzling effect was recently discovered, in which the elimination (knock-out) of an activating regulatory element leads to increased (rather than decreased) activity of the element being regulated. It has been postulated that this paradoxical behavior can be explained by activating and repressing transcription factors competing for binding to other possible targets. It is very difficult to prove this hypothesis in mammalian cells, due to the large number of potential players and the complexity of endogenous intracellular regulatory networks. Instead, this paper analyzes this issue through an analogous synthetic biology construct which aims to reproduce the paradoxical behavior using standard bacterial gene expression networks. The paper first reviews the motivating cancer biology work, and then describes a proposed synthetic construct. A mathematical model is formulated, and basic properties of uniqueness of steady states and convergence to equilibria are established, as well as an identification of parameter regimes which should lead to observing such paradoxical phenomena (more activator leads to less activity at steady state). A proof is also given to show that this is a steady-state property, and for initial transients the phenomenon will not be observed. This work adds to the general line of work of resource competition in synthetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Selective advantage of aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of glycolysis in aerobic conditions have been a subject of debate for more than a century. A hypothesis supported by previous data is that glycolysis has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass and per occupied volume than oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). However, a recent work by Shen et al14 challenges previous estimates, reporting that OxPhos has a higher rate of ATP production per protein mass than glycolysis. Here I show that Shen et al14 make a key assumption that is a subject of debate: that the proteomic cost of OxPhos is limited to proteins in enzymes of OxPhos and the TCA cycle. I argue that an intact mitochondria is required for functional OxPhos and therefore the whole mitochondrial protein content should be included for the cost estimate of OxPhos. After doing so, glycolysis is the most efficient pathway per protein mass or per volume fraction.</description>
