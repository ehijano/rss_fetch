      <title>A Path towards Thresholdless Colloidal Quantum Dot Lasers by Solving Decades of Mythology on Optical Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor quantum dot (CQD) was first conceived in the 1980s as offering potential for future lasers. Following high quality solution phase synthesis of colloidal CQD (CCQD) in 1993, optical gain was first demonstrated in 2000 via stimulated emission (SE) measurements. Decades of phenomenology have given rise to a Standard Model of optical gain in CCQD based upon two assumptions: a biexciton is required to achieve optical gain, and short biexciton lifetimes limit the efficient development of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The Standard Model predicts the solution to efficient ASE is slowing Auger recombination, a task which now consumes the CCQD field. Here, we show that the Standard Model is physically incorrect, leading to misdirected materials development. Inspection of the phenomenology reveals a Simple Model which uniquely reproduces all observed phenomena. The Simple Model provides the physical foundation for developing CCQD lasers with quantum leaps in performance, including thresholdless gain.</description>

      <title>BIFROST: A First-Principles Model of Polarization Mode Dispersion in Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BIFROST, a first-principles model of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers. Unlike conventional models, BIFROST employs physically motivated representations of the PMD properties of fibers, allowing users to computationally investigate real-world fibers in ways that are connected to physical parameters such as environmental temperature and external stresses. Our model, implemented in an open-source Python module, incorporates birefringence from core geometry, material properties, environmental stress, and fiber spinning. We validate our model by examining commercial fiber specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more applications across fiber technologies.</description>

      <title>A rigorous coupled-wave analysis of birefringent holographic gratings with periodically-modulated dielectric tensor along an in-plane direction and tensor variations in the thickness direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction of light upon interaction with thick slabs of a dielectric material having a periodic modulation of its refractive index (or dielectric tensor) is typically studied with the aid of the method known as the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). The method involves solving Maxwell's equations for a large number of coupled electromagnetic plane-waves inside the dielectric slab, then matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the incidence medium and the slab, as well as those at the interface between the slab and the transmittance medium. In this way, one obtains the E-field and H-field amplitudes for all the reflected and transmitted plane-waves (i.e., diffraction orders as well as evanescent waves) that emerge within the incidence and transmittance media. If the refractive index (or dielectric tensor) of the holographic slab happens to vary in the thickness direction, one treats the slab as a number of thin layers stacked upon each other, then computes and combines the scattering matrices of these layers to arrive at the complete solution for the entire stack. The goal of the present paper is to extend the standard RCWA method to the case where the hologram's dielectric tensor varies in the thickness direction (in addition to being periodically modulated along an in-plane axis), without slicing up the thick hologram into a number of thin layers. The reflected and transmitted plane-waves in this case exhibit a large degree of degeneracy, but our numerical results confirm the validity and the accuracy of our proposed algorithm for handling such degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Dynamically tuneable helicity in twisted electromagnetic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality, through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by $\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$, a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$. In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong photon-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Using Aberrations to Improve Dose-Efficient Tilt-corrected 4D-STEM Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images, the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC methods alone, and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Broadband entangled-photon omni-resonance in a planar optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant field enhancement in an optical cavity is a promising pathway towards realizing optical nonlinearities at the few-photon level. This quest is hampered by inevitable narrowing of the resonant linewidth as the cavity finesse is increased, which necessitates striking a compromise between the magnitude of the field enhancement and the bandwidth over which it is harnessed. This difficulty is exacerbated for broadband entangled-photon pairs, which are typically frequency-anticorrelated, so that the two photons cannot be simultaneously admitted to a cavity except when the degenerate wavelength coincides with a cavity resonance. Here we show that introducing judicious angular dispersion into single-photon and entangled-photon states before incidence on a planar Fabry-P{\'e}rot (FP) cavity renders these non-classical fields omni-resonant: the entire spectrum is coupled to a single longitudinal cavity mode. Making use of a planar FP cavity of finesse $\approx100$, resonant linewidth $\approx0.3$~nm, and free spectral range $\approx22$~nm in the near-infrared, we couple single-photon states and frequency-anticorrelated entangled-photon states of 20-nm bandwidth to a broadband achromatic resonance associated with a single underlying narrowband longitudinal FP-cavity mode -- thereby preserving the entangled spectral structure. In general, pre-conditioning the optical field by introducing angular dispersion enables coupling non-classical states of light to a single longitudinal cavity mode, even if the field bandwidth far exceeds the resonant linewidth, or even exceeds the cavity free-spectral-range. These results pave the way to broadband resonant interactions with non-classical states of light in photon-starved applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Photonic Band Diagram Generation with Transformer-Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials. However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.</description>

      <title>Doubling the field of view and eliminating the replica overlap problem in common-path shearing quantitative phase imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables label-free, high-contrast visualization of transparent specimens, but its common implementation in off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) requires a separate reference beam, which increases system complexity and sensitivity to noise and vibrations. Common-path shearing DHMs overcome these drawbacks by eliminating the reference arm, yet they suffer from sheared object beam (replica) overlap, as both interfering sheared beams traverse the sample and generate superimposed phase images. This limits their use to sparse objects only. Here we introduce R2D-QPI, a method that numerically decouples object and replica fields of view through controlled shear scanning. The method analytically separates overlapped phase images and effectively doubles the imaged area, requiring only two measurements. We experimentally validate the approach on a phase resolution test target, yeast cells, and human thyroid tissue slices, demonstrating accurate reconstruction even in highly confluent samples with strong object-replica overlap. The results establish R2D-QPI as a robust and versatile solution for common-path QPI, enabling wide-field, label-free phase imaging with minimal data acquisition and strong potential for applications in biological and medical microscopy.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of \emph{topological} Hall-effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear optical process via spatial symmetry-breaking in pseudo-spin textures created by a spatially-structured pump laser beam. The experimental configuration consists of a moderately-focused pump laser beam undergoing a parametric interaction with an organic solvent (toluene) and an off-resonant laser beam probes the non-trivial spatial magnetization textures created by the pump beam. The phase-profile of the transmitted probe beam is extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms for ascertaining the topological charge which is shown to be consistent with the estimation of Berry's curvature that we obtain via paraxial approximation-based modeling of third-order nonlinear interaction.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation from CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots in in-situ selected Laguerre-Gaussian modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Parametric dependence of unidirectional guided resonances in periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional guided resonances (UGRs) in periodic structures are special resonant modes that exhibit strict one-sided radiation, even though radiation in both sides is allowed, offering significant advantages for various applications. Under a structural perturbation, a UGR typically turns to a regular resonant mode that radiates to both sides. Existing numerical results indicate that to find UGRs in any periodic structure, it is necessary to tune at least one parameter. In this work, we develop a rigorous theory on the parametric dependence of UGRs. We show that in the presence of a single radiation channel, a UGR can exist continuously with respect to a structural parameter, provided that another parameter (associated with a generic perturbation) is properly tuned. Moreover, from a periodic structure with a generic bound state in the continuum (BIC), it is always possible to obtain a continuous family of UGRs by tuning one parameter. This implies that UGRs with arbitrarily large quality factor can be easily obtained. Our work provides a theoretical basis for designing useful photonic devices based on UGRs.</description>

      <title>Erdos-Turan photonic Ising machines with record-high coupling resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as promising platforms for efficiently tackling a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems relevant to resource allocation, statistical inference and deep learning, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by the coarse resolution of spin-spin couplings (Jij). Current implementations, relying on direct modulation of physical parameters, achieve at most 256 discrete coupling levels, which severely hinder the faithfully modeling of arbitrary real-valued interactions in realistic applications. Here we present a novel photonic Ising machine that encodes spins in random lattices while programming couplings in the momentum space of light. By introducing the Sidon set-a mathematical structure ensuring pairwise difference uniqueness - and employing the Erdos-Turan bound, we establish an optical framework in which each spin pair can be assigned a unique Jij. This approach decouples the resolution limit from hardware modulation to the spatial precision in the momentum space of light. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record-high coupling resolution of 7,038 on a simple photonic platform, surpassing previous Ising machines. Our results highlight the power of uniting discrete mathematics with momentum-space photonics, paving the way toward scalable Ising machines capable of faithfully modeling real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Continuous Topological Transition in Real Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic topological transitions refer to the transformation of is isofrequency contours in hyperbolic materials from one topology (e.g., hyperbolic) to another (e.g., elliptical or a different hyperbolic topology). However, current research remains limited to investigating topological transitions in momentum space, thereby hindering the simultaneous real-space observation of distinct hyperbolic states and their associated topological transitions within a single system. In this work, we investigate real-space hyperbolic continuous topological transitions using gradient-index (GRIN) lenses, exemplified by hyperbolic Luneburg lens. By introducing Wick rotations, we demonstrate how spatially modulated refractive indices, mediated by variations in out-of-plane permittivity, drive continuous transitions between hyperbolic Type I and Type II topologies. Furthermore, using a harmonic oscillator model, we uncover the intrinsic relationship between the parameter E of hyperbolic Luneburg lens and its predominant topological behavior, whether hyperbolic Type I or Type II, and extend this concept to a broader framework of Morse lenses. This work provides a theoretical foundation for designing materials with tunable topological properties, advancing applications in photonics, metamaterials, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Fiber-to-chip grating couplers for Lithium Niobate on Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium Niobate on Sapphire (LNOS) is an emerging platform for photonic integrated circuits, offering unique properties such as a wide transparency window, high nonlinearity, and strong electro-optic, nonlinear, and acousto-optic effects. Efficient light coupling between optical fibers and on-chip waveguides is crucial for practical applications. We present the design, simulation, and experimental demonstration of high-efficiency fiber-to-chip grating couplers for LNOS. The grating coupler design employs a self-imaging approach with a fixed period and linearly diminished filling factor, enabling a negative diffracted angle to match the fiber array and suppress higher-order diffraction. Numerical simulations predict a coupling efficiency of 42% at 1550 nm wavelength. The grating couplers are fabricated on an X-cut, 400 nm thick LN film with a 220 nm etching depth using electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching. Experimental characterization using a fiber array and a 6-axis displacement stage reveals a single-end coupling efficiency exceeding 20%, confirming the effectiveness of the design.

Abstract: We present a method to extract the photon indistinguishability error from Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements, accounting for the combined effects of loss and multiphoton noise that contaminate the single-photon Hilbert space. Our analysis resolves apparent inconsistencies in previous interpretations of such measurements. The reported method applies to a wide range of single-photon sources, including quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of terahertz high-harmonic generation by cavity engineering of Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals -- remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic generation essentially saturates.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 3. Optimization using a simple model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of optimization of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging setups is considered in the case of projection X-ray imaging and three-dimensional tomography with phase retrieval. For two-dimensional imaging, a simple model for a homogeneous edge feature embedded in a bulk sample is used to obtain analytical expressions for the image intensity. This model allows for explicit optimization of the geometrical parameters of the imaging setup and the choice of X-ray energy that maximizes the image contrast or the contrast-to-noise ratio. We also consider the question of optimization of the biomedical X-ray imaging quality characteristic which balances the contrast-to-noise against the spatial resolution and the radiation dose. In the three-dimensional case corresponding to propagation-based phase-contrast tomography with phase retrieval according to Paganin's method, the optimization of the imaging setup is studied with respect to the source size, the detector resolution, the geometrical magnification and the X-ray energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of drugs able to mitigate neurodegenerative diseases has created an urgent need for novel diagnostics. Although biomarker detection directly in patients' blood is now possible, low-cost point-of-care tests remain a challenge, because relevant biomarkers, especially amyloid-\beta (A$\beta$) peptides, are small, they occur at very low concentrations, and detecting a single marker is insufficient. Here, we introduce an optical biosensor based on a nanopillar structure that employs a gold nanoparticle amplification strategy. The sensor is able to detect 20 pg/ml of A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 in undiluted serum, which is the clinically required level. We also show the detection of the A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 peptides in the same channel, which is highly relevant for assessing disease progress and opens a route towards multiplexing. Alongside their simplicity and portability, these nanotechnology innovations make a major contribution to the ability to detect and monitor the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.</description>

      <title>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</description>

Abstract: We investigate second-order nonlinear processes in a system of two coupled identical optical micro-resonators. The double resonance and phase-matching conditions are simultaneously obtained thanks to the frequency splitting induced by the resonator coupling. The analysis made in the framework of the coupled mode theory is applied to the second harmonic generation process in two whispering gallery mode microdisks made in III-V materials.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors enabled by independent integration of Optical Pulling and Lateral Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>

      <title>Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Phase Noise Tolerance for Single-Carrier M-QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications with Advantages of Photonic Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. While photonic approaches, such as microcombs, are known to realize ultralow phase noise, the quantitative level of suppression required to sustain reliable high-order QAM transmission has not been clarified. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt the 3{\sigma} error criterion, which maps residual distortions onto the constellation, providing a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasize the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators such as microcombs.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: Tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved probing of recolliding electron wave packets in liquids and aqueous solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.</description>
