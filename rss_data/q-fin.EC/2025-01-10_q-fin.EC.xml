      <title>An Instrumental Variables Approach to Testing Firm Conduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding firm conduct is crucial for industrial organization and antitrust policy. In this article, we develop a testing procedure based on the Rivers and Vuong non-nested model selection framework. Unlike existing methods that require estimating the demand and supply system, our approach compares the model fit of two first-stage price regressions. Through an extensive Monte Carlo study, we demonstrate that our test performs comparably to, or outperforms, existing methods in detecting collusion across various collusive scenarios. The results are robust to model misspecification, alternative functional forms for instruments, and data limitations. By simplifying the diagnosis of firm behavior, our method provides an efficient tool for researchers and regulators to assess industry conduct. Additionally, our approach offers a practical guideline for enhancing the strength of BLP-style instruments in demand estimation: once collusion is detected, researchers are advised to incorporate the product characteristics of colluding partners into own-firm instruments while excluding them from other-firm instruments.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the progress of Indian states chasing sustainable development goals using complex network framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a critical global framework for addressing challenges like poverty, inequality, climate change, etc. They encourage a holistic approach integrating economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability to create a better future. We aim to examine India's responsibility in achieving the SDGs by recognizing the contributions of its diverse states in the federal structure of governance. As the nodal agency in India, the NITI Aayog's existing SDG index, using various socioeconomic indicators to determine the performance across different goals, serves as a foundation for assessing each state's progress. Building on the seminal works of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) and Tachhella et al. (2012), which introduced the economic complexity/fitness index, Sciarra et al. (2020) proposed the SDGs-Generalized Economic Complexity (GENEPY) framework to quantify "complexity" by computing "ranks for states" and "scores for goals", treating them as part of a complex bipartite network. In this paper, we apply the SDGs-GENEPY, to evaluate the progress and evolution of Indian states and union territories over several years. This enables us to identify each state's capacity (and rank) in achieving the SDGs. We can interpret these complexity scores as "centrality measures" of a complex bipartite network of the states and the goals. This enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between state capabilities and the achievability of SDGs within the Indian context and enables data-driven policy-making.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Global Emission Permit Prices and Regional Social Cost of Carbon under Noncooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a dynamic multi-region model of climate and economy with emission permit trading among 12 aggregated regions in the world. We solve for the dynamic Nash equilibrium under noncooperation, wherein each region adheres to the emission cap constraints following commitments that were first outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement and later strengthened under the Glasgow Pact. Our model shows that the emission permit price reaches $845 per ton of carbon by 2050, and global average temperature is expected to reach 1.7{\deg}C above the pre-industrial level by the end of this century. We demonstrate, both theoretically and numerically, that a regional carbon tax is complementary to the global cap-and-trade system, and the optimal regional carbon tax is equal to the difference between the regional marginal abatement cost and the permit price. We show that optimal regional carbon tax has significant heterogeneity between regions, and the tax needs to be implemented in both the developed and the developing regions.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Borda Count Variations Using Ranked Choice Voting Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard voting methods in the United States, plurality and ranked choice (or instant runoff) voting, are susceptible to significant voting failures. These flaws include Condorcet and majority failures as well as monotonicity and no-show paradoxes. We investigate alternative ranked choice voting systems using variations of the points-based Borda count which avoid monotonicity paradoxes. These variations are based on the way partial ballots are counted and on extending the values of the points assigned to each rank in the ballot. In particular, we demonstrate which voting failures are possible for each variation and then empirically study 421 U.S. ranked choice elections conducted from 2004 to 2023 to determine the frequency of voting failures when using five Borda variations. Our analysis demonstrates that the primary vulnerability of majority failures is rare or nonexistent depending on the variation. Other voting failures such as truncation or compromise failures occur more frequently compared to instant runoff voting as a trade-off for avoiding monotonicity paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Country-Level Vaccination Rates and Determinants of Practical Capacity to Administer COVID-19 Vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 vaccine development, manufacturing, transportation, and administration proved an extreme logistics operation of global magnitude. Global vaccination levels, however, remain a key concern in preventing the emergence of new strains and minimizing the impact of the pandemic's disruption of daily life. In this paper, country-level vaccination rates are analyzed through a queuing framework to extract service rates that represent the practical capacity of a country to administer vaccines. These rates are further characterized through regression and interpretable machine learning methods with country-level demographic, governmental, and socio-economic variates. Model results show that participation in multi-governmental collaborations such as COVAX may improve the ability to vaccinate. Similarly, improved transportation and accessibility variates such as roads per area for low-income countries and rail lines per area for high-income countries can improve rates. It was also found that for low-income countries specifically, improvements in basic and health infrastructure (as measured through spending on healthcare, number of doctors and hospital beds per 100k, population percent with access to electricity, life expectancy, and vehicles per 1000 people) resulted in higher vaccination rates. Of the high-income countries, those with larger 65-plus populations struggled to vaccinate at high rates, indicating potential accessibility issues for the elderly. This study finds that improving basic and health infrastructure, focusing on accessibility in the last mile, particularly for the elderly, and fostering global partnerships can improve logistical operations of such a scale. Such structural impediments and inequities in global health care must be addressed in preparation for future global public health crises.</description>
