Abstract: Instantaneous Noise-Based Logic (INBL) represents a computational paradigm that offers a deterministic alternative to quantum computing. INBL encodes logical information in orthogonal stochastic processes ("noise-bits") and exploits their superpositions and nonlinear interactions to achieve an exponentially large computational space of dimension 2^M, where M corresponds to the number of noise-bits analogous to qubits in quantum computing. This approach enables an exponential increase in computational throughput, with a computational speedup scaling on the order of O(2^M), while maintaining hardware complexity comparable to quantum systems. Unlike quantum computers, INBL operates without decoherence, error correction, or probabilistic measurement, yielding deterministic outputs with low error probability. Demonstrated applications include exponential-time phonebook searches (for number or name lookup) and the implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, illustrating INBL's capability to perform special-purpose computations with quantum-like exponential speedup using classical-physical noise-based hardware. We present an experimental comparison between the execution speeds of a Classical Turing machine algorithm - which changes the values of odd numbers in an exponentially large set to their next lower even numbers - and its INBL counterpart. Our results demonstrate that, in practical scenarios, the INBL algorithm's speed increases exponentially relative to the classical algorithm for values of M greater than 4, and it surpasses the Classical algorithm for M&gt;8. At the highest tested value, M=20, the INBL algorithm achieved a speedup of approximately 4,000 times over the classical approach. Extrapolating to M=32 - the upper limit for our 64-bit system emulating the INBL scheme - the anticipated speedup would reach roughly 16 million.</description>
