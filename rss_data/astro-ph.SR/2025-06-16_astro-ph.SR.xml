      <title>Discovery of Faint Nebulosity Around a Z Camelopardalis-type Cataclysmic Variable in Antlia: Nova Shell or Ancient Planetary Nebula?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our discovery of a faint nebula surrounding a previously little-studied 15th-mag variable star, ASASSN-19ds, in the southern-hemisphere constellation Antlia. Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable (CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its out-of-eclipse brightness shows a "sawtooth" light curve with an amplitude of $\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to nearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is $M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds as a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the nebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times. Our imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the major axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We consider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing information we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an unobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient planetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these possibilities. At the star's distance of only $\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption would have been a spectacular naked-eye event.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Driven by Magnetic Pressure Generated through Stellar Magnetosphere-Disk Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of jets in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains a subject of active investigation. We present a 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the circumstellar disk. At the beginning of the simulation, the magnetosphere partially opens, forming two oppositely directed magnetic field regions: one threading the star and the other threading the inner disk. The latter dominates over the original disk field at small radii and contributes to launching a disk wind. In our model, the jet is launched from the interface between these regions by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along ``two-legged'' field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the disk surface. Outflows are driven along these lines via a ``load-fire-reload'' cycle: in the ``load'' stage, differential rotation between the stellar and disk footpoints generates a toroidal magnetic field; in the ``fire'' stage, vertical gradients in toroidal field strength drive the outflow and release magnetic energy; and in the ``reload'' stage, magnetic reconnection between oppositely directed field lines resets the configuration, enabling the cycle to repeat. This process occurs rapidly and asynchronously across azimuthal angles, producing a continuous, large-scale outflow. From an energetic perspective, Poynting flux transports the toroidal field from the vicinity of the star into the polar cavity, powering the jet. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic field geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVII: The circumbinary disk and the outflow of the L 1551 IRS 5 binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using continuum and $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ line data obtained from the large ALMA program FAUST, we studied the structure of the protostellar binary system L1551 IRS5 at scales between 30 and 3,000 au to constrain its properties, from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks up to the envelope and outflow scales, which exhibits complex and entangled structures at the scales of its inner and outer envelopes, presumably caused by the influence of the central binary. Assuming a dust-to-gas ratio of 100, we calculated the dust+gas mass for the circumbinary disk and each circumstellar disk of the binary, obtaining 0.018 M$_{\odot}$, for the circumbinary disk, 0.004 M$_{\odot}$, and 0.002 M$_{\odot}$, for the northern and southern circumstellar disk respectively. From the line emission, we retrieved the gas masses for each structure component. With the $\text{C}^{18}\text{O}\:(2-1)$ PV diagram along the circumbinary disk, we were able to constrain the centrifugal barrier, $r_{CB}=55$ au, update the specific angular momentum, $j\sim270$~au~km~s$^{-1}$. We built an analytical model that can be used to predict the influence of the morphology of the outflow and a few dynamic features that can reproduce the system emission, allowing us to explain and discern the outflow contribution from the complex emission due to the binary. Additionally, we inferred the density power law index, $\alpha=1.7$, and the envelope rotation velocity, $v_{c}=2$~km~s$^{-1}$. Finally, the observations gave us the physical constraints to obtain a coherent outflow model for L1551 IRS5.</description>

      <title>Average solar active region: I. Intensities, velocities, and the photospheric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Solar active regions (ARs) are key manifestations of the Sun's magnetic activity, displaying diverse spatial and temporal characteristics. Their formation and evolution play a crucial role in understanding the solar dynamo and space weather. While individual ARs exhibit significant variability, ensemble averaging offers a method to extract their typical properties and evolution. Aims: This study aims to construct an average bipolar AR using ensemble averaging of observational data. By normalizing ARs in space and time, we seek to identify general trends in the evolution of magnetic flux, velocity fields, and atmospheric emissions, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing AR development. Methods: We analysed a sample of bipolar ARs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The ARs were selected based on strict criteria, ensuring clear polarity separation and emergence within 60 degrees of the solar central meridian. Normalisation procedures were applied to align ARs spatially and temporally before computing an ensemble average of various observables, including line-of-sight magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and multi-wavelength intensity maps. Results: The average AR exhibits a well-defined evolutionary pattern, with flux emergence followed by peak activity and subsequent decay. The leading polarity retains coherence longer than the trailing one, consistent with previous studies. Surface flow maps revealed a diverging outflow near the emergence site before the emerged AR is clearly visible in magnetograms. Atmospheric emission variations indicate enhanced heating above the AR in later phases, possibly due to persistent reconnection events. The ensemble averaging approach highlights systematic features of AR evolution that are often obscured by individual-case variability.</description>

      <title>Effective supernova dust yields from rotating and non-rotating stellar progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) are believed to be the dominant sources of dust production at high redshift. However, the reverse shock generated by the interaction of the SN forward shock and the interstellar medium (ISM) significantly reduces the mass of newly formed dust in SN ejecta. This study quantifies the mass, composition, and grain size distribution of surviving dust after the passage of the reverse shock using the GRASHrev model. Our analysis covers a grid of SN models with progenitor masses $13\,M_\odot\leq m_\star\leq120M_\odot$, metallicity $-3\leq\text{[Fe/H]}\leq0$, and rotation velocities $v = 0$ and $300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The SN explosions occur in a uniform ISM with densities $n_\text{ISM} = 0.05, 0.5$, and $5\text{ cm}^{-3}$. We find that the larger grains ($\gtrsim10\text{ nm}$) are more resistant to destruction by the reverse shock, with amorphous carbon dominating the surviving dust mass in most models. The surviving dust mass decreases with increasing ISM density. For non-rotating progenitors, the maximum mass of dust surviving the passage of the reverse shock is $\simeq 0.02\,M_\odot$ released by SN explosions of a $120\,M_\odot$ progenitor with $\text{[Fe/H]}=0$ in the ISM density $0.5\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to $\simeq4\%$ of the initial dust mass before the passage of the reverse shock. Among rotating progenitors, a maximum surviving mass fraction is $\simeq5\%$ with a final dust mass $\simeq0.03\,M_\odot$ in $\text{[Fe/H]}=-1$ models. Although the reverse shock has a strong destructive impact, our results indicate that, on very short timescales, SNe can enrich the ISM with carbonaceous grains ranging in size from approximately $1\text{ nm}$ to $100\text{ nm}$ (up to $\simeq1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in non-rotating models). This is notable given the detection of the 2175 \r{A} extinction bump in galaxies at $z&gt;6$, suggesting the early presence of such dust.</description>

      <title>Spot-Crossing Variations Confirm a Misaligned Orbit for a Planet Transiting an M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOI-3884~b is an unusual 6.4~R$_\oplus$ planet orbiting an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-crossing events. We used the \textit{Tierras} Observatory to monitor both the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet. We show that the star rotates with a period of $11.021 \pm 0.014$~days. We simultaneously model the rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to determine the true stellar obliquity, $\psi_\star$. The data are best described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly inclined star ($\psi_\star = {76.1^\circ} ^{+2.2^\circ}_{-2.6^\circ}$; $i_\star = {24.4^\circ}^{+1.8^\circ}_{-1.4^\circ}$) that hosts a large polar starspot ($r_\mathrm{spot} = {33.1^\circ}^{+2.0^\circ}_{-1.9^\circ}$; $\lambda_\mathrm{spot} = {79.4^\circ}^{+1.4^\circ}_{-1.2^\circ}$). Archival photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884 system provides a benchmark for studying the evolution of a polar spot on an M dwarf.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars: A Correlation with Effective Temperature and Implications for White Dwarf Merger Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO-He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses - dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution ($R \approx 75000$) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&lt;1$, while the RCB stars have $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}&gt;4$. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low $^{16}\textrm{O}/^{18}\textrm{O}$ ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of $^{14}\textrm{N}$ and $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ is converted to $^{18}\textrm{O}$ in these stars via $\alpha$-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.</description>

      <title>A ZTF Search for Circumstellar Debris Transits in White Dwarfs: Six New Candidates, one with Gas Disk Emission, identified in a Novel Metric Space</title>

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) showing transits from orbiting planetary debris provide significant insights into the structure and dynamics of debris disks. This is a rare class of objects with only eight published systems. In this work, we perform a systematic search for such systems within 500 pc in the Gaia-eDR3 catalog of WDs using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and present six new candidates. Our selection process targets the top 1% most photometrically variable sources identified using a combined variability metric from ZTF and Gaia eDR3 photometry, boosted by a metric space we define using von Neumann statistics and Pearson-Skew as a novel discovery tool to identify these systems. This is followed by optical spectroscopic observations of visually selected variables to confirm metal pollution. Four of the six systems show long-timescale photometric variability spanning several months to years, resulting either from long-term evolution of transit activity or dust and debris clouds at wide orbits. Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of reddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction makes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius $\lesssim$$0.3~{\rm \mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also shows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk orbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the abundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show that transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates compared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of these systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near future. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very long-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.</description>

      <title>A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project. I. The impact of metallicity and helium abundance on the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) and their luminosity function (PNLF) in galaxies have been used as a cosmic distance indicator for decades, yet a fundamental understanding is still lacking to explain the universality of the PNLF among different galaxies. Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar metallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the importance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension between PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is applicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and observations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB tracks, PN models, and circumnebular extinction to obtain PNe from a parent stellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the resulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old metal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at high metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation of helium at high metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar ages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even for old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find that the PNLFs of old stellar populations are sensitive to the IFMR, allowing for the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for studying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients for this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS include modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the universal PNLF cutoff and using it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.</description>

Abstract: We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment characterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.</description>

Abstract: Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M &lt; $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Alien Type Ia supernovae from the Milky Way merger history and one possible candidate: Kepler's supernova</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way is a dynamic and evolving system shaped by numerous merger events throughout its history. These mergers bring stars with kinematic and dynamic properties differing from the main stellar population. However, it remains uncertain whether any of the Galactic supernova remnants can be attributed to such a merger origin. In this work, we compare the progenitor of Kepler's supernova to its nearby stars, ``alien'' stars, and in-situ Milky Way stellar populations. We uncover the abnormal kinematics and dynamics of Kepler's supernova and propose that its progenitor may have an extragalactic origin. We call the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produced by stars accreted into the Milky Way through merger events ``alien SNe Ia'' since they are cosmic immigrants. We estimate the rate of alien SNe Ia exploded recently using two methods: through galactic chemical evolution, and through a method without considering exact star formation history, introduced for the first time in this paper. We consider the past accretion of a few major satellite galaxies -- Kraken, Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Sagittarius, Wukong/LMS-1, and Cetus -- assuming these were dry mergers. The first method yields $1.5\times 10^{-5} - 5.0\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, while the second method yields a comparable ${3.1}^{+1.8}_{-{1.1}}\times10^{-5}\rm\,yr^{-1}$ as the rate estimates for recent alien SNe Ia. These estimates represent lower bounds because we assumed no postmerger star formation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06139</link>

Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations found evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow parameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds and all types of SNe. Assuming a Kroupa-like shape of the IMF with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow rate is proportional to the supernova energy injection rate divided by the halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies and discuss the implications of our results for reionization and transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>
