      <title>Foreshock Ultra-Low Frequency Waves at Mars: Consequence on the Particle Acceleration Mechanisms at the Martian Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33 \pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.</description>

      <title>Ambient air plasma acceleration in tightly-focused ultrashort infrared laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical results have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons in the MeV range by focusing tightly a few-cycle laser beam in ambient air. Using Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, this configuration is revisited within a more accurate modelling approach to analyze and optimize the mechanism responsible for electron acceleration. In particular, an analytical model for a linearly polarized tightly-focused ultrashort laser field is derived and coupled to a PIC code, allowing us to model the interaction of laser beams reflected by high-numerical aperture mirrors with laser-induced plasmas. A set of 3D PIC simulations is performed where the laser wavelength is varied from 800 nm to 7.0 $\mu$m while the normalized amplitude of the electric field is varied from $a_{0} = 3.6$ to $a_{0} = 7.0$. The preferential forward acceleration of electrons, as well as the analysis of the laser intensity evolution in the plasma and data on electron number density, confirm that the relativistic ponderomotive force is responsible for the acceleration. We also demonstrate that the electron kinetic energy reaches a maximum of $\approx1.6$ MeV when the central wavelength is of 2.5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Demarcating the classical and quantum approaches for the Coulomb logarithm in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb logarithm often enters various plasma models and simulation methods for computing the transport and relaxation properties of plasmas. Traditionally, a classical pair collision picture was used to calculate the Coulomb logarithm for different plasma parameters. With the recent emergence of the high interest in dense plasmas with partially degenerate electrons, new approaches have been developed to treat electron-ion collisions in a quantum-mechanical way. In this context, gaining a deeper physical understanding of the criteria for the applicability of classical plasma models is crucial. We have analyzed the Coulomb logarithm describing the electron-ion collisions in hydrogen plasmas in a wide range of temperatures and densities relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The electron-ion collision cross-sections were computed using both quantum and classical scattering theories. We found that the classical description of the electron-ion scattering in plasmas and related plasma models is applicable if the de Broglie wavelength of electrons is smaller than the ion charge screening length in plasmas. Additionally, we show that the quantum first-order Born approximation for describing the electron-ion collision is accurate only in the regime where classical scattering theory is accurate.</description>

      <title>Automatic classification of magnetic field lines by persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for the automatic classification of the orbits of magnetic field lines into topologically distinct classes using the Vietoris-Rips persistent homology is presented. The input to the method is the Poincare map orbits of field lines and the output is a separation into three classes: islands, chaotic layers, and invariant tori. The classification is tested numerically for the case of a toy model of a perturbed tokamak represented initially in its geometric coordinates. The persistent $H_1$ data is demonstrated to be sufficient to distinguish magnetic islands from the other orbits. When combined with persistent $H_0$ information, describing the average spacing between points on the Poincare section, the larger chaotic orbits can then be separated from very thin chaotic layers and invariant tori. It is then shown that if straight field line coordinates exist for a nearby integrable field configuration, the performance of the classification can be improved by transforming into this natural coordinate system. The focus is the application to toroidal magnetic confinement but the method is sufficiently general to apply to generic $1\frac{1}{2}$d Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Application of mesh refinement to relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During relativistic magnetic reconnection, antiparallel magnetic fields undergo a rapid change in topology, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of non-thermal particle acceleration. This work explores the application of mesh refinement to 2D reconnection simulations to efficiently model the ineherent disparity in length-scales. We have systematically investigated the effects of mesh refinement and determined necessary modifications to the algorithm required to mitigate non-physical artifacts at the coarse-fine interface. We have used the ultrahigh-order Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time-Domain (PSATD) Maxwell solver to analyze how its use can mitigate the numerical dispersion that occurs with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) (or ``Yee'') method. Absorbing layers are introduced at the coarse-fine interface to eliminate spurious effects that occur with mesh refinement. We also study how damping the electromagnetic fields and current density in the absorbing layer can help prevent the non-physical accumulation of charge and current density at the coarse-fine interface. Using a mesh refinement ratio of 8 for two-dimensional magnetic reconnection simulations, we obtained good agreement with the high resolution baseline simulation, using only 36% of the macroparticles and 71% of the node-hours needed for the baseline. The methods presented here are especially applicable to 3D systems where higher memory savings are expected than in 2D, enabling comprehensive, computationally efficient 3D reconnection studies in the future.</description>

      <title>Transition signatures for electron-positron pair creation in space-time inhomogeneous electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of electron-positron pair creation through multi-photon absorption in a space-time dependent electric field is analyzed using computational quantum field theory. Our findings reveal two distinct pair creation channels: the symmetric and asymmetric transition channels. We propose that the asymmetric transition channel arises from the inherent spatial inhomogeneity of intense laser pulses. By mapping the field-theoretical model of laser-assisted multi-photon pair creation onto a quantum-mechanical time-dependent framework, a semi-analytical solution that captures the asymmetric transition signatures of vacuum decay is derived. Additionally, it is demonstrated that neglecting spatial inhomogeneity leads to erroneous transition amplitudes and incorrect identification of pair creation channels, even when the dipole approximation holds.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Pre-Trained and Fine-Tuned Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models characterising physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, and needing further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. The paper provides an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, ranging from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. The paper concludes with a viable conformal prediction formalisation that provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Growth rate of self-sustained QED cascades induced by intense lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was suggested [A. R. Bell &amp; J. G. Kirk, PRL 101, 200403 (2008)] that an avalanche of electron-positron pairs can be triggered in the laboratory by a standing wave generated by intense laser fields. Here, we present a general solution to the long-standing problem of the avalanche growth rate calculation. We provide a simple formula that accounts for the damping of the growth rate due to pair and photon migration from the region of prolific generation. We apply our model to a variety of 3D field configurations including focused laser beams and show that i) the particle yield for the full range of intensity able to generate an avalanche can be predicted, ii) a critical intensity threshold due to migration is identified, iii) the effect of migration is negligible at a higher intensity and the local growth rate dominates. Excellent agreement with Monte Carlo and self-consistent PIC simulations is shown. The growth rate calculation allows us to predict when abundant pair production will induce a back-reaction on the generating field due to plasma collective effects and screening. Our model can be applied to study the generation of electron-positron pair avalanches in realistic fields to plan future experiments at ultra-high-intensity laser facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a vertical structure terahertz field emission transistor that utilizes a high-angle oblique deposition method to form a self-packaged vacuum microcavity. The simulation demonstrates that the self-packaged microcavity can effectively mitigate the potential impact of conventional field emission transistors on surrounding solid-state circuits, thereby improving the frequency performance and stability of the device. The proposed design exhibits a cutoff frequency at the sub-terahertz level.</description>

      <title>Kinetic scales dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of fully kinetic 3D numerical simulations and observations in solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere that the transition from deterministic chaos to turbulence at kinetic (sub-ion) scales in space plasmas is generally dominated by magnetic helicity (an adiabatic invariant in a weakly dissipative plasma) directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). The magneto-inertial range of scales at sub-electron scales has been also briefly discussed. Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the space observations in the frames of this approach.</description>
