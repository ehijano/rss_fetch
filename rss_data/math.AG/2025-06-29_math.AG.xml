      <title>On the mirrors of low-degree del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare different constructions of mirrors of del Pezzo surfaces, focusing on degree $d \leq 3$. In particular, we extract Lefschetz fibrations, with associated exceptional collections, from the mirrors obtained via the Hori-Vafa and Fanosearch program constructions, which we relate to one another. We show with geometric methods that the Lefschetz fibrations define categorical mirrors. With a more explicit approach, we give a sequence of (numerical) mutations relating the exceptional collections considered by Auroux, Katzarkov, and Orlov with those arising in this paper. This uses the theory of surface-like pseudolattices, and extends some of the string junction results of Grassi, Halverson and Shaneson. Our argument lifts directly to an equivalence of certain Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from our fibrations and those of Auroux, Katzarkov, and Orlov.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bridgeland Stability Conditions on the Category of Coherent Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we give a wide class of examples of stability conditions on the category of coherent sheaves which generalise Gieseker stability. They are referred to as "adapted to coherent sheaves" and they admit Harder-Narasimhan and Jordan-H\"older filtrations. We also study the particular case of Bayer's polynomial Bridgeland stability conditions, and their relation to the gauge theoretical counterpart introduced by Dervan-McCarthy-Sektnan.</description>

      <title>Terminal Fano four folds in low codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct well-formed and quasismooth terminal Fano 4-folds of index 1 in low codimension containing at worst isolated orbifold points. We provide a certain classification of these varieties where their images under the anitcanonical embedding can be described as codimension 2, 3, or 4 subvarieties of some weighted projective space. In particular, we focus on isolated terminal Fano 4-folds that either have an empty linear system or a relatively large one, but whose linear section is not an isolated canonical Calabi--Yau 3-fold. In total, we classify 95 families of terminal Fano 4-folds of the first type and 32 families of the second type. We also describe our algorithmic approach and the pivotal role of computer algebra in our results.</description>

      <title>A Real Reduction of the Manifold of Bridgeland Stability Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a $k$-linear triangulated category. The space of Bridgeland stability conditions on $\mathcal{T}$, denoted by $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$, forms a complex manifold. In this paper, we introduce an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$ and study the quotient space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T}) := \mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})/\sim$, which parametrizes what we call reduced stability conditions. We show that $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ admits the structure of a real (possibly non-Hausdorff) manifold of half the dimension of $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$. The space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ preserves the wall-and-chamber structure of $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$, but in a significantly simpler form. Moreover, we define a relation $\lesssim$ on $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$, and show that the full stability manifold $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$ can be reconstructed from the space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ together with the additional data $\lesssim$.
  We then focus on the case where $\mathcal{T} = \mathrm{D}^b(X)$, the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth polarized variety $(X, H)$. By explicitly describing $\mathrm{Sb}(X)$ for varieties $X$ of small dimension, we formulate two equivalent conjectures concerning a family of stability conditions $\mathrm{Stab}_H^*(X)$ and their reduced counterparts $\mathrm{Sb}_H^*(X)$ on $\mathrm{D}^b(X)$. We establish some desirable properties for both families. In particular, using a version of the restriction theorem formulated in terms of $\lesssim$, we show that the existence of $\mathrm{Stab}_H^*(X)$ implies the existence of stability conditions on every smooth subvariety of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Coble hypersurfaces, uniquely characterized by the remarkable property that their singular loci are an abelian surface and a Kummer threefold, respectively, belong to a family of hypersurfaces exhibiting similar behavior, but defined in various types of homogeneous spaces. With the help of Jordan-Vinberg theory, we show how these hypersurfaces can be parametrized by G{\"o}pel type varieties inside projectivized representations of complex reflection groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all smooth compact connected K\"ahler threefolds that admit the structure of a $C^\infty$-fiber bundle over the circle. This generalizes the work of Hao and Schreieder in the projective case. In contrast to the projective case, there cannot always exist a smooth morphism to a positive-dimensional torus. Instead, we show that such a compact K\"ahler threefold admits a finite \'etale cover that is bimeromorphic to a $\mathbb{P}^1$-, $\mathbb{P}^2$-, or Hirzebruch surface-bundle over a locally trivial torus-fiber bundle over a smooth compact connected K\"ahler base. Our results prove Kotschick's conjecture in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Pencils of projective hypersurfaces, Griffiths heights and geometric invariant theory. II Hypersurfaces with semihomogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the formula for the stable Griffiths height of the middle-dimensional cohomology of a pencil of projective hypersurfaces $H$, with semihomogeneous singularities, over some smooth projective curve $C$, that appears as Theorem 5.1 in the first part of this paper (arxiv:2506.15334).
  The proof of this formula relies on the strategy developed in my previous work (arxiv:2212.11019v3) to derive an expression for this Griffiths height when the only singularities of the fibers of $H$ over $C$ are ordinary double points. To deal with general semihomogeneous singularities, we complement this strategy by the construction of a finite covering $C'$ of $C$ such that the pencil $H' = H \times_C C'$ over $C'$ admits a smooth model $\widetilde{H}'$ with semistable fibers with smooth components. This allows us to circumvent the delicate issue of the determination of the elementary exponents attached to the singular fibers of $H/C$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an elementary proof that with the exceptions of certain $\Pi$-projective spaces, both the Picard group and the $\Pi$-Picard set of the isomeric (i.e. type-Q) supergrassmannian are trivial. We extend this technique to show that the Picard group and the $\Pi$-Picard set of a supertorus orbit closure within the isomeric supergrassmannian can be easily calculated from its defining polytope by counting the number of simplex factors. Since the presence of nontrivial invertible sheaves and $\Pi$-invertible sheaves depends entirely on factors of $\Pi$-projective space, we construct them as symmetric powers of the tautological sheaf and its dual.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic localization in Donaldson-Thomas theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a toric localization formula in the cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. Consider a (-1)-shifted symplectic algebraic space with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-action leaving the (-1)-shifted symplectic form invariant (typical examples are the moduli space of stable sheaves or complexes of sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant Calabi-Yau form or the intersection of two $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant Lagrangians in a symplectic space with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant symplectic form). In this case we express the restriction of the Donaldson-Thomas perverse sheaf (or monodromic mixed Hodge module) defined by Joyce et al. to the attracting variety as a sum of cohomological shifts of the DT perverse sheaves on the $\mathbb{G}_m$-fixed components. This result can be seen as a (-1)-shifted version of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition for smooth schemes. We obtain our result from a similar formula for stacks and Halpern-Leistner's Theta-correspondence, at the level of perverse Nori motives, which we use also to derive foundational constructions in DT theory, in particular the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing formula and the construction of the Cohomological Hall Algebra for smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefolds (a similar construction of the CoHA was also done independently by Kinjo, Park, and Safronov in a recent work). This paper subsumes the previous paper "Hyperbolic localization of the Donaldson-Thomas sheaf" from the same author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume polynomials measure the growth of Minkowski sums of convex bodies and of tensor powers of positive line bundles on projective varieties. We show that Aluffi's covolume polynomials are precisely the polynomial differential operators that preserve volume polynomials, reflecting a duality between homology and cohomology. We then present several applications to matroid theory.</description>

Abstract: For a quadratic form $\varphi$ over a field of characteristic different from $2$, we study whether its group of proper projective similitudes ${\bf PSim}^+(\varphi)$ is rationally connected (i.e. $R$-trivial).
  We obtain new sufficient conditions in terms of structure properties of $\varphi$. We further provide new examples of quadratic forms $\varphi$ belonging to a given power of the fundamental ideal in the Witt ring and such that ${\bf PSim}^+(\varphi)$ is not rationally connected.</description>

Abstract: A classical result states that on a smooth algebraic curve of genus $g$ the number of Weierstrass points, counted with multiplicity, is $g^3-g$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of geometric Weierstrass points of metric graphs and show that a generic metric graph of genus $g$ has $g^3-g$ geometric Weierstrass points counted with multiplicity. Our methods also provide a new proof of the existence of Weierstrass points on metric graphs of genus bigger than or equal to $2$.</description>

      <title>On Primes of Ordinary and Hodge-Witt Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.09404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jean-Pierre Serre has conjectured, in the context of abelian varieties, that there are infinitely primes of good ordinary reduction for a smooth, projective variety over a number field. Any prime of ordinary reduction is also a prime of Hodge-Witt reduction but not conversely. More generally, Conjecture 4.1.2 asserts the existence of infinitely many primes of Hodge-Witt reduction. The two conjectures are related but not equivalent (Theorem 4.1.4). We prove this conjecture for abelian threefolds Theorem 4.3.1 (joint with C. S. Rajan), and smooth Fano threefolds (Theorem 4.4.9) and in Theorem 4.5.4 for all simple abelian varieties with complex multiplication (this implies a conjecture of Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Srinivas for such abelian varieties). We show that the set of primes of ordinary and Hodge-Witt reduction can have different densities (Theorem 4.5.4, Example 6.3.1). Theorem 6.2.1 asserts that for Fermat hypersurfaces of dimension $\geq 3$ and degrees $\geq 211$, at least 98% of the primes are of non Hodge-Witt (and hence non-ordinary) reduction. We include here an unpublished joint result Theorem 3.3.1 with C. S. Rajan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nakayama showed that deformation invariance of plurigenera for smooth complex varieties follows from the MMP and Abundance Conjectures. We generalize his result to families of singular pairs over DVRs of positive or mixed characteristic. As an application we show invariance of plurigenera for deformations of good minimal models of general type varieties whose canonical model has rational singularities as well as boundedness of Gorenstein canonical models of dimension three and fixed volume over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;5$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general framework for wall-crossing of equivariant K-theoretic enumerative invariants of appropriate moduli stacks $\mathfrak{M}$, by lifting Joyce's homological universal wall-crossing arXiv:2111.04694 to K-theory and to include equivariance. The primary new tool is that the operational K-homology of $\mathfrak{M}$ is an equivariant multiplicative vertex algebra.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative vertex algebras and quantum loop algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a multiplicative version of vertex coalgebras and show that various equivariant K-theoretic constructions of Hall algebras (KHAs) also admit a compatible multiplicative vertex coalgebra structure. In particular, this is true of the preprojective KHA of Varagnolo--Vasserot, which is (conjecturally) isomorphic to certain quantum loop algebras.</description>

      <title>On the Albanese morphism of varieties with Frobenius stable Kodaira dimension zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in positive characteristic, the Albanese morphism of normal proper varieties $X$ with $\kappa_S(X, \omega_X) = 0$ is separable, surjective, has connected fibers, and the generic fiber $F$ also satisfies $\kappa(F, \omega_F) = 0$. As a corollary, we deduce a new case of Iitaka's subadditivity conjecture for fibrations over abelian varieties, when the generic fiber has non-nilpotent Hasse-Witt matrix.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares of regular functions on rational surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sums of squares on cylinders of the form $X \times \mathbb{A}_K$ for a (weakly) factorial curve $C$. We prove the equality of the Pythagoras numbers of the ring of regular functions on the cylinder with that of the field of rational functions. We then apply these results to the case of (uniformly) rational varieties. We show that if $X$ is a nonsingular rational algebraic surface over the reals, then the Pythagoras number of the ring of regular functions on $X$ is bounded above by 12.</description>

      <title>Endoscopic decomposition of elliptic Fargues-Scholze L-packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this note is to show that the local L-packet of Fargues-Scholze [FS], corresponding to an elliptic L-parameter, has an endoscopic decomposition. Our argument is strongly motivated by a beautiful paper of Chenji Fu [Fu], where the stable case is proven. To put our results in a more general context, we also formulate a general endoscopic decomposition over complex numbers based on results of Arthur, and suggest a conjectural generalization of this decomposition over an arbitrary algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology and singular cohomology of toric varieties via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an affine toric variety $X$ embedded in a smooth variety, we prove a general result about the mixed Hodge module structure on the local cohomology sheaves of $X$. As a consequence, we prove that the singular cohomology of a proper toric variety is mixed of Hodge-Tate type. Additionally, using these Hodge module techniques, we derive a purely combinatorial result on rational polyhedral cones that has consequences regarding the depth of reflexive differentials on a toric variety.
  We then study in detail two important subclasses of toric varieties: those corresponding to cones over simplicial polytopes and those corresponding to cones over simple polytopes. Here, we give a comprehensive description of the local cohomology in terms of the combinatorics of the associated cones, and calculate the Betti numbers (or more precisely, the Hodge-Du Bois diamond) of a projective toric variety associated to a simple polytope.</description>

      <title>Gram-like matrix preserving extensions and completions of noncommutative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a positive noncommutative polynomial $f$, equivalently a sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS), there exists a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that encrypts all the structural essence of $f$. There are no available methods for extending a noncommutative polynomial to a SOHS keeping the Gram matrices unperturbed. As a remedy, we introduce an equally significant notion of Gram-like matrices and provide linear algebraic techniques to get the desired extensions. We further use positive semidefinite completion problem to get SOHS and provide criteria in terms of chordal graphs and 2-regular projective algebraic sets.</description>
