      <title>Deciphering Super El Ni\~no: Development of a Novel Predictive Model Integrating Local and Global Climatic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, extreme weather events have surged, highlighting the urgent need for action on the climate emergency. The year 2023 saw record-breaking global temperatures, unprecedented heatwaves in Europe, devastating floods in Asia, and severe wildfires in North America and Australia. Super El Ni\~no events, known for their profound impact on global weather, play a critical role in these changes, causing severe economic and environmental damage. This study presents a novel predictive model that integrates systematically local and global climatic signals to forecast Super El Ni\~no events, introducing the Super El Ni\~no Index (SEI), which value of 80 or higher defines a Super El Ni\~no event. Our analysis shows that the SEI accurately reflects past Super El Ni\~no events, including those from 1982-83, 1997-98, and 2015-16, with SEI values for these periods containing 80 within the 2-sigma standard deviation. Using data up to 2022, our model predicted an SEI of around 80 for 2023, indicating a Super El Ni\~no for the 2023-24 period. Recent observations confirm that the 2023-24 El Ni\~no is among the five strongest recorded Super El Ni\~no events in history. An analysis of SEI trends from 1982 to 2023 reveals a gradual increase, with recent El Ni\~no events consistently exceeding SEI values of 70. This trend suggests that El Ni\~no events are increasingly approaching Super El Ni\~no intensity, potentially due to more favorable conditions in the equatorial Pacific. This increase in SEI values and the frequency of stronger El Ni\~no events may be attributed to the ongoing effects of global warming. These findings emphasize the need for heightened preparedness and strategic planning to mitigate the impacts of future Super El Ni\~no events, which are likely to become more frequent in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? Fixing the 'Broken Record' while unmasking the dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to address the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming, significantly higher than CO2 (Kleinberg, 2020; Balcombe et al., 2018). Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure methane's short-term, negative climatic effects, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses (Kleinberg, 2020). This letter examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing methane's true climate impact, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of underreporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that in the immediate future, during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that give appropriate attention to methane's short-term warming potential to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.</description>

      <title>Segmenting sea ice floes in close-range optical imagery with active contour and foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06641v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size and shape of sea ice floes play a crucial role in influencing ocean-atmosphere energy exchanges, sea ice concentrations, albedo, and wave propagation through ice-covered waters. Despite the availability of diverse image segmentation techniques for analyzing sea ice imagery, accurately detecting and measuring floes remains a considerable challenge. This study presents a precise methodology for in-situ sea ice imagery acquisition, including automated orthorectification to correct perspective distortions. The image dataset, collected during an Antarctic winter expedition, was used to evaluate various automated image segmentation approaches: the traditional GVF Snake algorithm and the advanced deep learning model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). To address the limitations of each method, a hybrid algorithm combining traditional and AI-based techniques is proposed. The effectiveness of these approaches was validated through a detailed analysis of ice floe detection accuracy, floe size, and ice concentration statistics, with the outcomes normalized against a manually segmented benchmark.</description>

      <title>CoDiCast: Conditional Diffusion Model for Weather Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 3-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at \url{https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast}.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Koopman Operator Estimation in Idealized Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is revolutionizing weather forecasting, with new data-driven models achieving accuracy on par with operational physical models for medium-term predictions. However, these models often lack interpretability, making their underlying dynamics difficult to understand and explain. This paper proposes methodologies to estimate the Koopman operator, providing a linear representation of complex nonlinear dynamics to enhance the transparency of data-driven models. Despite its potential, applying the Koopman operator to large-scale problems, such as atmospheric modeling, remains challenging. This study aims to identify the limitations of existing methods, refine these models to overcome various bottlenecks, and introduce novel convolutional neural network architectures that capture simplified dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lightning-Fast Convective Outlooks: Predicting Severe Convective Environments with Global AI-based Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Severe convective storms are among the most dangerous weather phenomena and accurate forecasts mitigate their impacts. The recently released suite of AI-based weather models produces medium-range forecasts within seconds, with a skill similar to state-of-the-art operational forecasts for variables on single levels. However, predicting severe thunderstorm environments requires accurate combinations of dynamic and thermodynamic variables and the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Advancing the assessment of AI-models towards process-based evaluations lays the foundation for hazard-driven applications. We assess the forecast skill of three top-performing AI-models for convective parameters at lead-times of up to 10 days against reanalysis and ECMWF's operational numerical weather prediction model IFS. In a case study and seasonal analyses, we see the best performance by GraphCast and Pangu-Weather: these models match or even exceed the performance of IFS for instability and shear. This opens opportunities for fast and inexpensive predictions of severe weather environments.</description>

      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP). Part 1: Establishing a Baseline Climatology for Severe Weather across the Philippine Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the rudimentary reporting methods and general lack of documentation, the creation of a severe weather database within the Philippines has been difficult yet relevant target for climatology purposes and historical interest. Previous online severe weather documentation i.e. of tornadoes, waterspouts, and hail events, has also often been few, inconsistent, inactive, or is now completely decommissioned. Several countries or continents support severe weather information through either government-sponsored or independent organizations. For this work, Project SWAP stands as a collaborative exercise, with clear data attribution and open avenues for augmentation, and the creation of a common data model to store the phenomenon's information will assist in maintaining and updating the aforementioned online archive in the Philippines. This paper presents the methods necessary for creating the SWAP database, provide broader climatological analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in severe weather occurrence within the Philippine context, and outline potential use cases for the data. We also highlight the project's current limitations as is to any other existing and far larger database, and emphasize the need for understanding these events' and their mesoscale environments, inline to the current severe weather climatologies across the globe.</description>

      <title>Utilizing smartphone sensors for accurate solar irradiance measurement and educational purposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy production is a major challenge. We present an innovative solution by utilizing smartphone light sensors to measure direct normal solar irradiance, the primary component of ground-level solar radiation. We provide comprehensive guidelines for calibrating the sensor using two methods: a professional reference measurement and clear-sky satellite estimates. The latter method is particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments. Once calibrated, the smartphone becomes a valuable tool for measuring the solar resource. We propose an instructional laboratory focusing on the physics of solar radiation and its interaction with the Earth's atmosphere, exploring solar variations across locations, cloud conditions, and time scales. By integrating irradiance values measured throughout a day the daily irradiation can be estimated. This approach enhances students' understanding of solar radiation attenuation and its relationship with atmospheric interactions. This method offers a practical and educational solution for promoting renewable energy knowledge and addressing the challenges of the energy transition.</description>
