      <title>On the adiabatic invariance of the trapped wave's action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown (Gavrilov et al., Nonlinear Dyn, 112, 2024) that in a linear continuum system with time-varying parameters, the amplitude of a strongly localized mode can be calculated as a function of current parameter values and does not depend on the history of parameters change. This fact allows one to introduce the adiabatic invariant for such a system according to the general definition as a quantity that remains approximately constant in a system with several slowly time-varying parameters. In this paper, we show that, introduced in such a way, the adiabatic invariant can be calculated as the ratio of localized mode energy and its frequency. This yields a dramatically simplified way to solve a class of problems concerning localized oscillation of continuum systems with discrete inclusions, although it is not always clear enough what "the mode energy" is. The observed fact allows one to consider newly introduced adiabatic invariants as a straightforward generalization of a notion known to Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Architecture in Hidden Quantum Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of causal hidden quantum Markov models (cHQMMs) that refine standard HQMMs by explicitly reversing the order between hidden updates and emissions. Through a minimal qubit model, we show that the conventional "emission-then-transition" and the alternative "transition-then-emission" architectures generally generate nonequivalent quantum processes, with distinct temporal correlation structures and different patterns of entanglement across time. At the same time, we prove that these two classes coincide for entangled lifting of classical hidden Markov models, where they share the same classical reduced process, thereby identifying a sharp boundary between classical and genuinely quantum hidden memory. These features suggest potential utility for modeling and analyzing quantum memory in sequential quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Some effective operators for graphene monolayer superlattices, from variational perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to provide precise effective operators for monolayer graphene at Fermi energy. We consider the microscopic potential created by a lattice, and add a macroscopic potential with the same periodicity but varying at a scale $\varepsilon^{-1} \in \mathbb{N}$, creating a superlattice. Our approach consists in coupling the variational approximation, perturbation theory together with a multiscale method. At the effective level the usual massless Dirac operator is replaced by other operators, and we provide simulations in the case of graphene.</description>

      <title>Schauder estimates for germs of distributions on smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss germs of distributions on $d-$dimensional smooth Riemannian manifolds and, in particular, we derive \emph{multi-level Schauder estimates} without making any further assumptions on the underlying geometry. As a preliminary step, we define the notions of coherence and homogeneity for germs of distributions on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 1$. Subsequently, we formulate both the reconstruction theorem, cf., [CZ20], and the Schauder estimates, cf., [BCZ24], in this setting. Leveraging the properties of the exponential map, we extend these results to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we devise a counterpart of the reconstruction theorem previously established in the literature [RS21], while additionally proving the regularity of the reconstructed distribution in suitable H\"older-Zygmund spaces. Finally, by introducing a novel concept of $\beta$-regularizing kernels on Riemannian manifolds, we establish Schauder estimates for coherent and homogeneous germs in this context.</description>

      <title>A compositional framework for classical kinematic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim is to introduce a category-theoretic framework sufficiently general to describe a wide variety of open kinematic systems in classical mechanics while uniquely characterizing systems with specified simplest components. The framework models open systems as morphisms in a category $\mathsf{Kin}(\mathcal{F})$, where composition encodes relationships between subsystems and their embedding into larger systems. Unlike previous approaches, the framework supports a precise treatment of geometric constraints, enabling the characterization of systems with feedback. A consequence is a structural formulation of lower kinematic pairs that clarifies system interactions.</description>

      <title>Global Attractors for Dissipative Flows on Degenerate Constraint Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of dissipative dynamical systems evolving on smooth constraint hypersurfaces endowed with degenerate induced bilinear forms is studied. The intrinsic evolution is generated by constraint--preserving vector fields on manifolds whose tangent bundles admit a nontrivial null distribution associated with the degeneracy of the induced structure. In this indefinite setting, the absence of coercive Lyapunov functionals prevents the direct application of classical attractor theory developed for Riemannian phase spaces. Dissipation is instead characterized relative to functionals that are compatible with the null distribution and exhibit decay exclusively in directions transverse to the associated foliation. Under suitable involutivity and regularity assumptions on the null distribution, all bounded trajectories are shown to be asymptotically confined to invariant leaves of the corresponding foliation. Asymptotic compactness of the intrinsic evolution is then established without coercivity by reducing the dynamics to a projected semiflow on the quotient manifold determined by the characteristic distribution. In the presence of a bounded absorbing set and continuous semiflow structure, the intrinsic evolution admits a compact global attractor saturated by the null leaves, whose effective asymptotic dynamics are governed by a compact invariant subset of the reduced phase space. Furthermore, when the compatible functional satisfies a Morse--type nondegeneracy condition in directions transverse to the null distribution and the induced transversal linearization admits no center spectrum, the projected semiflow possesses no neutral directions. The resulting framework provides a mechanism by which constraint--induced degeneracy enforces effective dimensional reduction in dissipative geometric evolution systems.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling structure of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM observables with matrix Bessel kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I continue the program of studying the strong coupling expansion of certain observables in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory, which are given by a determinant with a matrix Bessel kernel. I show that, by reorganizing the transseries of the determinant at large values of the 't Hooft coupling, a simple underlying structure emerges, in which each exponentially suppressed correction is related to the perturbative series in a simple way. This new approach provides an efficient method to generate the full transseries for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM observables, such as the cusp anomalous dimension, multi-gluon scattering amplitudes, and the octagon form factor. Using high-precision numerical analysis, I verify the results and provide a complete description of the resurgence structure of the strong coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>The heat equation and independence of the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on $\ell^p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the heat equation associated to the Hodge Laplacian on simplicial complexes. Using recently developed techniques for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, we prove Davies-Gaffney-Grigoryan type estimates for the kernel of the heat semigroup on $\ell^2,$ which we then use to extend the semigroup to $\ell^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty]$ under suitable curvature and volume growth conditions. Furthermore, we establish $p$-independence of the Hodge Laplacian spectrum under the assumption of form bounded curvature and uniform subexponential volume growth. While the main focus of the paper is the Hodge Laplacian on simplicial complexes, the results are indeed proven for general positive magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on graphs.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Fixed Point in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ultraviolet behavior of 4-dimensional Lorentzian covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and address the problem of infinite ambiguities relating to the triangulation dependence of spinfoam amplitudes. We consider the complete LQG amplitude that summing spinfoam amplitudes over 2-complexes. By introducing spin-network stacks and their covariant extension, spinfoam stacks, the summation over complexes is partitioned into distinct families. We demonstrate that the theory exhibits a condensation phenomenon, where quantum geometry condenses to a dominant small spin configuration. We identify a candidate fixed point controlling the ultraviolet (small spin) regime of covariant LQG. At this fix point, the complete LQG amplitude dynamically reduces to a topological theory at leading order, and the infinite ambiguities of triangulation dependence reduces to a finite set of boundary coefficients associated with a finite basis of 3-dimensional boundary blocks. These results provide a definition for the continuum limit of spinfoam theory at the fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Extended scattering channels for random matrix simulations of polarized light transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the propagation of light through disordered media is central to understanding and controlling wave transport in diverse optical and mesoscopic applications. Here, we present a random matrix simulation framework for modeling the transport of polarized light through random media composed of arbitrary particulate scatterers. Our approach employs extended scattering channels applied to angular spectral decompositions of the underlying fields, enabling flexible representations of arbitrary illumination and detection profiles. In contrast to previous work, this framework provides a rigorous treatment of scattering matrix correlations and offers novel geometric insights into the optical memory effect. We provide a detailed exposition of the underlying theory and illustrate several key features through numerical simulations. Our work is supported by a free accompanying codebase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that topologically protected quantum states, such as anyons, may be attached to super/semiconductor heterostructures has received enormous attention, but experimental signatures in 1D systems remain elusive. Here we revisit theoretical underpinnings of anyons in 2D fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, whose signatures have been experimentally observed by independent groups. Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.</description>

      <title>A unified duality framework for barotropic, quantum and Korteweg fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dual variational formulation, in the spirit of Brenier, for several compressible fluid models: the compressible barotropic Euler system, the quantum Euler system, and the Euler-Korteweg system. We identify a unified abstract framework encompassing all three systems, which enables a simultaneous analysis. By introducing time-adaptive weights, we establish the consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We prove the existence of variational dual solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problems for continuous, vacuum-free initial data in spaces of finite Radon measures, and establish the absence of a duality gap. As an application, we formulate and prove a 'Dafermos principle' for these models: no subsolution can dissipate the total entropy earlier or at a faster rate than the corresponding strong solution on its interval of existence. We also discuss connections between our abstract consistency result and Brenier's shock-free substitutes for entropy solutions of Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Unitary and finite self-energy of a single classical point charge and naked point singularity spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations of the superextremal Reissner--Nordstr\"om geometry in its static Kerr--Schild rest frame, viewing it as the nonlinear self-field of a single static point charge. In optical radial coordinates, and using the Kodama--Ishibashi gauge-invariant formalism, each radiative multipole is encoded by a single scalar master field on the half-line. The resulting master equation is of Regge--Wheeler type, with an inverse-square potential core at the optical apex (controlled by a Hardy inequality) and a short-range tail at infinity. The spatial-plus-potential part of the Einstein--Maxwell $T$-energy is closable and bounded below, which defines a positive quadratic form on the natural energy space. Its Friedrichs extension then gives the canonical self-adjoint realization of the master operator. The static Coulomb field and its nonlinear gravitational backreaction are treated as the exact background. All linear Einstein--Maxwell perturbations with finite spatial $T$-energy evolve unitarily on the energy space. The naked singularity at finite optical distance is ``silent'' in the technical sense that it carries no $T$-energy flux. We also construct the forward radiation field at future null infinity, obtaining a translation representation of the self-field dynamics in which the conserved $T$-energy coincides with the $L^2$ norm of the radiation profile in retarded time.</description>

Abstract: We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be represented by the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its bipartite entanglement entropy. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the entanglement statistics of different states of a given Hamiltonian or different Hamiltonians subjected to same symmetry constraints. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection hidden underneath different quantum states.</description>

      <title>The extremely-tilted fluid regime near asymptotically Kasner big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the relativistic Euler equations with a linear barotropic equation of state on a large class of background spacetimes with Kasner big bang asymptotics. Building on previous work in the asymptotically non-tilted regime, which applies when the speed of sound of the fluid is large in comparison to the Kasner exponents, we now consider the asymptotically extremely-tilted regime when the speed of sound is small. We solve the Cauchy problem for the Euler equations towards the big bang singularity and prove, without any symmetry assumptions or smallness conditions on the Cauchy data, that the solutions exist globally in time provided the mean curvature of the initial hypersurface is sufficiently large. Finally, we prove that the solutions exhibit the asymptotics expected from standard heuristic arguments in this regime; in particular, fluid particles are driven towards the speed of light in the direction of the largest Kasner exponent as the big bang singularity is approached.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Nekrasov instanton sum with adjoint matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nekrasov instanton partition function of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ $U(N)$ gauge theory (a mass deformation of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory), which is a generating series of equivariant integrals over instanton moduli spaces, is given by a sum over colored partitions weighted by a counting parameter $\mathfrak{q}$. This note proves convergence of the series in the unit disk $|\mathfrak{q}|&lt;1$ for generic parameters. Specifically, the absolute convergence radius of this sum is determined, assuming that mass and Coulomb branch parameters avoid some lattice. If the ratio $b^2=\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2$ of equivariant parameters is in $\mathbb{C}\setminus[0,+\infty)$, the radius is $1$, as expected. If $b^2$ is non-negative, three cases arise: the radius is finite if $b^2$ has finite exponential type (a generalization of Brjuno numbers), namely there exists $C&gt;0$ such that $|b^2-p/q|&gt;\exp(-Cq)$ for all integers $p,q\neq 0$; the series diverges if $b^2$ is super-exponentially well approximable by rationals; and if $b^2$ is rational some terms are singular. The AGT correspondence translates these results to convergence of torus one-point conformal blocks of the Virasoro and $W_N$ algebras with non-real $b$, within the unit disk. For the Virasoro algebra this corresponds to a central charge in $\mathbb{C}\setminus[25,+\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp mixing time asymptotics of Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a sharp mixing time estimate of the Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model in the low-temperature regime. In contrast to the high-temperature regime studied by Cuff et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 149: 432-477, 2012), in which the Gibbs measure is concentrated around the equiproportional distribution of spins, the Gibbs measure in the low-temperature regime is concentrated on multiple states, each with a dominant number of a single spin. Consequently, global mixing of the system requires sufficiently many transitions between these states. Since these transitions are well explained by the phenomenon of metastability, the theory of metastability plays a central role in the analysis of slow mixing. In particular, the sharp asymptotics for the mixing time is given by the mixing time of the limit Markov chain, which describes the metastable behavior of the dynamics, multiplied by the metastable transition time-scale. As a byproduct, we verify that it does not exhibit a cutoff phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Fendley et al. (2025) [arXiv:2511.04674] revealed a new way to demonstrate the integrability of XYZ Heisenberg model by constructing a one-parameter family of integrals of motion in the matrix product operator (MPO) form. In this short note, I report on the discovery of two-parameter families of MPOs that commute with with the Heisenberg spin chain Hamiltonian in the XXX, XXZ, and XYZ cases. I describe a symbolic algebra approach for finding such integrals of motion and speculate about possible applications.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonians and Wilson--Polchinski renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to the Wilsonian renormalisation of Hamiltonians for 2-dimensional quantum field theories on the cylinder described in the UV by marginally relevant deformations of conformal field theories. To introduce a Wilsonian short-distance cutoff we make essential use of free field realisations of the full vertex operator algebra in the UV. Our method is intrinsically non-perturbative; we derive a Hamiltonian analogue of Polchinski's equation describing the flows of all couplings.
  As a primary example of our general method, we apply it to the marginal anisotropic deformation of the $\mathfrak{su}_2$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model at level 1, which is equivalent to the sine-Gordon model on the cylinder. In particular, we reproduce the standard renormalisation group flow of the sine-Gordon model near the Kosterlitz--Thouless point to second order in the couplings, a result usually derived using Lagrangian/path-integral methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a scattering matrix with operator valued entries describing solutions to the 1+1 wave equation where permittivities has memory and depends on time and space. It is the analogue of the scattering matrix for spatially localised perturbations where the entries are functions of frequency and appear as Fourier multipliers in solutions of the wave equation. This provides a mathematical explanation of the numerical construction in the recent paper by Horsley et al. The appendix by Zhen Huang and Maciej Zworski presents a numerical scheme for solving the wave equation considered in this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GAP measures (also known as Scrooge measures) are a natural class of probability distributions on the unit sphere of a Hilbert space that come up in quantum statistical mechanics; for each density matrix $\rho$ there is a unique measure GAP$_\rho$. We describe and prove a property of these measures that was not recognized so far: If a wave function $\Psi$ is GAP$_\rho$ distributed and a collapse occurs, then the collapsed wave function $\Psi'$ is again GAP distributed (relative to the appropriate $\rho'$). This fact applies to collapses due to a quantum measurement carried out by an observer, as well as to spontaneous collapse theories such as CSL or GRW. More precisely, it is the conditional distribution of $\Psi'$, given the measurement outcome (respectively, the noise in CSL or the collapse history in GRW), that is GAP$_{\rho'}$.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic charges of Curtright dual graviton and Curtright extensions of BMS algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic gauge charges of the Curtright mixed-symmetry rank-3 field $\phi_{[\rho\sigma]\nu}$ in Minkowski spacetime, interpreted in $ D = 5 $ as the dual graviton. In Bondi coordinates at future null infinity, we impose radiation fall-offs and fix a de Donder-like gauge together with an on-shell traceless condition, similarly to what happens in linearized gravity. Surface charges associated with the residual gauge transformations are constructed as boundary integrals via N\"other's 2-form. In $ D = 5 $, exploiting Hodge/Hodge-like decompositions on $ S^{3} $, the charge splits into a scalar sector $ Q_{\Phi} $, a vector sector $ Q_{V} $ and a TT sector $Q_{y^{\text{TT}}}$. $ Q_{\Phi} $ is parametrized by a single arbitrary scalar function $ \Phi $ (interpreted as the supertranslation-like parameter), $ Q_{V} $ is parametrized by a vector field $ V^{i} \in \mathfrak{Diff}(S^{3}) $ and the TT sector $Q_{y^{\text{TT}}}$ is parametrized by a trasverse-traceless rank-2 tensor $y_{ij}^{\text{TT}} \in \mathfrak{TT}(S^3)$. The corresponding charge algebra closes only if $V_i \in \mathfrak{o}(4)$ as semidirect sum $ \mathfrak{o}(4) \loplus (C^{\infty}(S^3) \oplus \mathfrak{TT}(S^3)) $, i.e an abelian extension of a $\mathfrak{BMS}$-like algebra featuring a higher-spin-like supertranslation sector.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Bianchi~V cosmological model inspired by quintessential $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar-field cosmologies in the Bianchi V spacetime using a dynamical-systems framework. Motivated by representative $\alpha$-attractor potentials - the E-model and T-model - we apply averaging theorems and amplitude--phase reductions to monomial potentials $\sim \phi^{2n}$ of the scalar field, which approximate the attractor models near their minima, in the presence of matter with barotropic index $\gamma$. The reduced averaged system admits five generic isolated equilibria: Kasner vacua $\mathcal{K}_0^\pm$, the matter FLRW point $\mathcal{F}$, the scalar FLRW point $\mathcal{S}$, and the curvature Milne-type point $\mathcal{K}$, together with special families for tuned $(n,\gamma)$. We find that $\mathcal{K}_0^\pm$ are always sources, $\mathcal{F}$ is generically a saddle but can act as a sink for $\gamma&lt;\min\{\tfrac{2n}{n+1},\tfrac{2}{3}\}$, $\mathcal{S}$ is a sink if $0&lt;n&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{2n}{n+1}&lt;\gamma\leq 2$, while $\mathcal{K}$ becomes a sink whenever $\gamma&gt;\tfrac{2}{3}$ and $n&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$. These results demonstrate that isotropic FLRW $\alpha$-attractor models extend naturally to anisotropic Bianchi~V cosmologies: inflationary attractors remain robust, while the Milne-type curvature solution emerges as the late-time state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Approach to Bosonization of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider bosonization of supersymmetry in the context of Wess-Zumino quantum mechanics. Our motivation for this investigation is the flexibility the bosonic fock space affords as any classical probability distribution can be realized on it making it a versatile framework to work with for quantum processes. We proceed by constructing a minimal bosonization of a system with one bosonic and two fermionic degrees of freedom. We iterate this process to construct a tower of SUSY systems that is akin to unfolded Adinkras. We then identify an osp(2|2) symmetry of the system constructed. To build an irreducible representation of the system we induce representations across the sectors, a first to our knowledge, as the previous work have focused on induction only within the bosonic sector. First, we start with a fermionic representation using Clifford algebras and then induce a representation to gl(2|2) and restrict it to osp(2|2). In the second method, we induce a representation from that of the bosonic sector. In both cases, our representations are in terms of qubit operators that provide a way to solve SUSY problems using quantum information based approaches. Depending upon the direction of induction the representations are suitable for implementation on a hybrid qubit and fermionic or bosonic quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional translation-invariant CSS stabilizer codes over prime-dimensional qudits on the square lattice under twisted boundary conditions, generalizing the Kitaev $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code by augmenting each stabilizer with two additional qudits. Using the Laurent-polynomial formalism, we adapt the Gr\"obner basis to compute the logical dimension $k$ efficiently, without explicitly constructing large parity-check matrices. We then perform a systematic search over various stabilizer realizations and lattice geometries for $p\in\{3,5,7,11\}$, identifying qudit low-density parity-check codes with the optimal finite-size performance. Representative examples include $[[242,10,22]]_3$ and $[[120,6,20]]_{11}$, both achieving $k d^{2}/n=20$. Across the searched regime, the best observed $k d^{2}$ at fixed $n$ increases with $p$, with an empirical relation $k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$, compatible with a Bravyi--Poulin--Terhal-type tradeoff when the interaction range grows with system size.</description>

Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. We derive an upper bound that agrees, at low density $\rho$, with the Huang-Yang conjecture. The latter captures the first three terms in an asymptotic low-density expansion, and in particular the Huang-Yang correction term of order $\rho^{7/3}$. Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.</description>

Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Multipole and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transitions in the Two-component Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional two-component Coulomb gas in the canonical ensemble and at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;2$. In this regime, the partition function diverges and the interaction needs to be cut off at a length scale $\lambda\in (0,1)$. Particles of opposite charges tend to pair into dipoles of length scale comparable to $\lambda$, which themselves can aggregate into multipoles. Despite the slow decay of dipole--dipole interactions, we construct a convergent cluster expansion around a hierarchical reference model that retains only intra-multipole interactions. This yields a large deviations result for the number of $2p$-poles as well as a sharp free energy expansion as $N\to\infty$ and $\lambda\to0$ with three contributions: (i) the free energy of $N$ independent dipoles, (ii) a perturbative correction, and (iii) the contribution of a non-dilute subsystem.
  The perturbative term has two equivalent characterizations: (a) a convergent Mayer series obtained by expanding around an i.i.d.\ dipole model; and (b) a variational formula as the minimum of a large-deviation rate function for the empirical counts of $2p$-poles. The Mayer coefficients exhibit transitions at $\beta_p=4-\tfrac{2}{p}$, that accumulate at $\beta=4$, which corresponds to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the low-dipole-density limit. At $\beta=\beta_p$ the $p$-dipole cluster integrals switch from non-integrable to integrable tails.
  The non-dilute system corresponds to the contribution of large dipoles: we exhibit a new critical length scale $R_{\beta, \lambda}$ which transitions from $\lambda^{-(\beta-2)/(4-\beta)}$ to $+\infty$ as $\beta$ crosses the critical inverse temperature $\beta=4$, and which can be interpreted as the maximal scale such that the dipoles of that scale form a dilute set.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of C\'ordova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11877v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{Teleportation=Translation} conjecture posits that the recovery of information from a black hole is dual to a geometric translation in the emergent spacetime. In this paper, we establish this equivalence for general local quantum field theories by constructing a continuous unitary interpolation that bridges discrete algebraic teleportation protocols and continuous modular flow. We resolve the failure of dynamic idempotency, fundamentally inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite Type~II$_\infty$ envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path. Crucially, we prove that its unique infinitesimal generator $\tilde{G}$ is exactly twice the geometric modular momentum ($\tilde{G}=2P$). We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that unitary information recovery fundamentally manifests as a continuous geometric translation. This provides a rigorous operator-algebraic mechanism for resolving the black hole information paradox, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction.</description>

      <title>The stochastic six vertex model and discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles</title>

Abstract: Stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit remarkable fluctuation phenomena. While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.
  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlev\'e II, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis employs a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which requires a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.
  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.04483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) provides a powerful framework for analyzing universal features of strongly coupled physical systems. In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), cold quark matter at asymptotically high density is expected to exhibit color superconductivity (CSC), the analogue of superconductivity in condensed-matter systems. Although CSC phases have been studied within RMT primarily in the macroscopic large-$N$ limit, where $N$ denotes the matrix size, it has remained unclear whether an RMT exists that realizes CSC in the microscopic large-$N$ limit. Here we answer this question in the affirmative by introducing a novel non-Hermitian chiral random matrix model. For three quark flavors, we show that the model exhibits spontaneous breaking of color $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ and flavor $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetries down to the diagonal $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ subgroup, thereby reproducing color-flavor locking in dense QCD. For two flavors, we find that color $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ is spontaneously broken to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ while the chiral symmetry $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}\times\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{R}}$ remains unbroken, consistent with the two-flavor color-superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial absolutely continuous part of anomalous dissipation measures in time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We positively answer Question 2.2 and Question 2.3 in [Bru\`e, De Lellis, 2023] in dimension $4$ by building new examples of solutions to the forced $4d$ incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which exhibit anomalous dissipation, related to the zeroth law of turbulence [K41]. We also prove that the unique smooth solution $v_\nu$ of the $4d$ Navier--Stokes equations with time-independent body forces is $L^\infty$-weakly* converging to a solution of the forced Euler equations $v_0$ as the viscosity parameter $\nu \to 0$. Furthermore, the sequence $\nu |\nabla v_\nu|^2$ is weakly* converging (up to subsequences), in the sense of measure, to $\mu \in \mathcal{M} ((0,1) \times \mathbb{T}^4)$ and $\mu_T = \pi_{\#} \mu $ has a non-trivial absolutely continuous part where $\pi$ is the projection onto the time variable. Moreover, we also show that $\mu$ is close, up to an error measured in $H^{-1}_{t,x}$, to the Duchon--Robert distribution $\mathcal{D}[v_0]$ of the solution to the $4d$ forced Euler equations. Finally, the kinetic energy profile of $v_0$ is smooth in time. Our result relies on a new anomalous dissipation result for the advection--diffusion equation with a divergence free $3d$ autonomous velocity field and the study of the $3+\frac{1}{2} $ dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. This study motivates some open problems.</description>

Abstract: Inhomogeneous random matrices with non-trivial variance profiles determined by symmetric stochastic matrices and with independent sub-Gaussian entries up to Hermitian symmetry, encompass a wide range of important models, including sparse Wigner matrices and random band matrices. In these models, the maximum entry variance-a natural proxy for sparsity-serves both as a key structural feature and a primary analytical obstacle. In this paper, we consider low-rank additive perturbations of such matrices and establish a sharp BBP phase transition for extreme eigenvalues at the level of the law of large numbers. Furthermore, in the Gaussian setting, we derive the fluctuations of spectral outliers under suitable conditions on the variance profile and perturbation. These fluctuations exhibit strong non-universality, depending on the eigenvectors, sparsity levels, and the underlying geometric structure. Our proof strategies rely on ribbon graph expansions, upper bounds for diagram functions, large-moment estimates, and the enumeration of typical diagrams.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate the perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and anticipated in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Go-or-grow approaches represent a specific class of mathematical models used to describe populations where individuals either migrate or reproduce, but not both simultaneously. These models have a wide range of applications in biology and medicine, chiefly among those the modeling of brain cancer spread. The analysis of go-or-grow models has inspired new mathematics, and it is the purpose of this review to highlight interesting and challenging mathematical properties of reaction--diffusion models of the go-or-grow type. We provide a detailed review of biological and medical applications before focusing on key results concerning solution existence and uniqueness, pattern formation, critical domain size problems, and traveling waves. We present new general results related to the critical domain size and traveling wave problems, and we connect these findings to the existing literature. Moreover, we demonstrate the high level of instability inherent in go-or-grow models. We argue that there is currently no accurate numerical solver for these models, and emphasize that special care must be taken when dealing with the "monster on a leash".</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of sparse random matrices, which includes the adjacency matrix of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph ${\bf G}(N,p)$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that the non-trivial edge eigenvectors are asymptotically jointly normal. The main ingredient of the proof is an algorithm that directly computes the joint eigenvector distributions, without comparisons with GOE. The method is applicable in general. As an illustration, we also use it to prove the normal fluctuation in quantum ergodicity at the edge for Wigner matrices. Another ingredient of the proof is the isotropic local law for sparse matrices, which at the same time improves several existing results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically studies the asymptotics of Humbert's bivariate confluent hypergeometric function $\Phi_1[a,b;c;x, y]$. Specifically, we establish explicit asymptotic expansions in five distinct regimes: (i) $x\to\infty$; (ii) $y\to\infty$; (iii) $x\to\infty,\,y\to\infty$; (iv) $x$ or $y$ small, $xy$ fixed; and (v) $x\to 1$, $y$ fixed. The utility of these expansions is illustrated through concrete applications in the theory of Saran's hypergeometric function $F_M$, the Glauber-Ising model, and the theory of Prabhakar-type fractional integral operators. Several potential directions for future work are also outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist elegant methods of aligning point clouds in $\mathbb R^3$. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to the case of Minkowski space, as we will show. Instead, we propose two solutions to the following problem: given inertial reference frames $A$ and $B$, and given (possibly noisy) measurements of a set of 4-vectors $\{v_i\}$ made in those reference frames with components $\{v_{A,i}\}$ and $\{v_{B,i}\}$, find the optimal Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda v_{A,i}=v_{B,i}$. The first method is direct least squares optimization through a parametrization of $SO(3,1)_+$ in terms of the familiar boost and rotation vectors. The second method takes a detour through the Lorentz algebra; in addition to being conceptually simple and possessing a computational advantage over the first method, it can easily be generalized to the alignment of vector representations in other matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotions, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers(QLSs)toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs naturally arise from graphs, and are of importance as they are connected to real-world applications. The achievable advantage with a QLS for an NLSP depends on the interplay between the scaling of condition number and sparsity of matrices associated with the graph family. We analyze 50 graph families and identify that within the scope of our study, only 21 of them exhibit prospects for an exponential advantage with the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm relative to an efficient classical solver. We call graph families that offer advantage with HHL as good graph families. We also compare the performance of the considered 50 graph families with 7 other QLSs. Furthermore, we report that some graph families graduate from offering no advantage with HHL to promising an exponential advantage with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm. We also introduce a unified graph superfamily and show the existence of infinite good graph families in it. Since the runtime expressions for linear solvers involve condition number, which in itself is not easy to compute, ascertaining advantage prospects with quantum linear solvers itself is not an easy problem. Thus, we conjecture the conditions under which one may visually examine a graph family and guess the prospects for an advantage. Finally, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that may arise even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modeling of knowledge and wealth dynamics in national and global markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a kinetic model to describe the dynamical evolution of wealth and knowledge in national and global markets, starting from a microscopic description of individual interactions. The model is built upon interaction rules that account for a strong interdependence between the microscopic variables, influencing agents' trading and saving propensities, knowledge acquisition, and the stochastic market effects. We begin with a domestic market scenario and extend the framework to international trade, incorporating the possibility of individual transfers between different countries. The dynamics of the system are described through Boltzmann-type equations, which allow for a detailed study of the evolution of the agent distribution in each country. In this context, we study the evolution of macroscopic quantities of the system, focusing on the number density of individuals, and the mean wealth and knowledge of each population, and we discuss these results in relation to existing models in the literature. Finally, under a quasi-invariant trading limit, we derive simplified Fokker-Planck type equations that reveal some emergent behaviors of the system, including the formation of Pareto tails in the long-term wealth and knowledge distributions.</description>

      <title>Curve separation in supercritical half-space last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study line ensembles arising naturally in symmetrized/half-space geometric last passage percolation (LPP) on the $N \times N$ square. The weights of the model are geometrically distributed with parameter $q^2$ off the diagonal and $cq$ on the diagonal, where $q \in (0,1)$ and $c \in [0, q^{-1})$. In the supercritical regime $c &gt; 1$, we show that the ensembles undergo a phase transition: the top curve separates from the rest and converges to a Brownian motion under $N^{1/2}$ fluctuations and $N$ spatial scaling, while the remaining curves converge to the Airy line ensemble under $N^{1/3}$ fluctuations and $N^{2/3}$ spatial scaling. Our analysis relies on a distributional identity between half-space LPP and the Pfaffian Schur process. The latter exhibits two key structures: (1) a Pfaffian point process, which we use to establish finite-dimensional convergence of the ensembles, and (2) a Gibbsian line ensemble, which we use to extend convergence uniformly over compact sets.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel made simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>On weak convergence of stochastic wave equation with colored noise on R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following stochastic wave equation on the real line $\partial_t^2 u_{\alpha}=\partial_x^2 u_{\alpha}+b\left(u_\alpha\right)+\sigma\left(u_\alpha\right)\eta_{\alpha}$. The noise $\eta_\alpha$ is white in time and colored in space with a covariance structure $\mathbb{E}[\eta_\alpha(t,x)\eta_\alpha(s,y)]=\delta(t-s)f_\alpha(x-y)$ where $f_\alpha$ is continuous with respect to $\alpha$ in Fourier mode, see assumption 1.2. We prove the continuity of the probability measure induced by the solution $u_\alpha$, in terms of $\alpha$, with respect to the convergence in law in the topology of continuous functions with uniform metric on compact sets. We also give several examples of $f_\alpha$ such that our theorem applies to.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Topological Phase Transition in a Quantum Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha&lt;3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha&gt;3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions, helical peptides can be modeled as piecewise integrable systems where the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic mapping $(\phi,\psi) \rightarrow (\kappa,\tau)$ between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for 50 helical peptide chains. This transformation is globally information-preserving but ill-conditioned within the helical basin (median Jacobian condition number 31), suggesting chiral information loss arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. Using a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation, we show deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity, while curvature remains rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy (median RMSD 0.77\,\AA), enabling a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects and trims non-integrable terminal fraying. Evaluating only these integrable islands, the dispersion relation extracts high-accuracy structural cores for 88\% of the dataset. Inverse backbone design is feasible within a defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to controlling torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>
