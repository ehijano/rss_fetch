      <title>The role of non-scientific factors vis-a-vis the quality of publications in determining their scholarly impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evaluation of scientific publications' impact, the interplay between intrinsic quality and non-scientific factors remains a subject of debate. While peer review traditionally assesses quality, bibliometric techniques gauge scholarly impact. This study investigates the role of non-scientific attributes alongside quality scores from peer review in determining scholarly impact. Leveraging data from the first Italian Research Assessment Exercise (VTR 2001-2003) and Web of Science citations, we analyse the relationship between quality scores, non-scientific factors, and publication short- and long-term impact. Our findings shed light on the significance of non-scientific elements overlooked in peer review, offering policymakers and research management insights in choosing evaluation methodologies. Sections delve into the debate, identify non-scientific influences, detail methodologies, present results, and discuss implications.</description>

      <title>A Repository for Formal Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is always at the center of the theoretical development and investigation of the applicability of formal concept analysis. It is therefore not surprising that a large number of data sets are repeatedly used in scholarly articles and software tools, acting as de facto standard data sets. However, the distribution of the data sets poses a problem for the sustainable development of the research field. There is a lack of a central location that provides and describes FCA data sets and links them to already known analysis results. This article analyses the current state of the dissemination of FCA data sets, presents the requirements for a central FCA repository, and highlights the challenges for this.</description>

      <title>Environmental migration? An overview of the literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature on the relationship between environmental factors such as climatic changes and natural hazards and human mobility (both internal and international) is characterized by heterogeneous results: some contributions highlight the role of climate changes as a driver of migratory flows, while others underline how this impact is mediated by geographical, economic and the features of the environmental shock. This paper attempts to map this literature, focusing on economics and empirical essays.
  The paper improves on the existing literature: (a) providing systematic research of the literature through main bibliographic databases, followed by a review and bibliometric analysis of all resulting papers; (b) building a citation-based network of contributions, that hollows to identify four separate clusters of paper; (c) applying meta-analysis methods on the sample of 96 papers released between 2003 and 2020, published in an academic journal, working papers series or unpublished studies, providing 3,904 point estimates of the effect of slow-onset events and 2,065 point estimates of the effect of fast-onset events.
  Overall, the meta-analytic average effect estimates a small impact of slow- and rapid-onset variables on migration, however positive and significant. When the clustering of the literature is accounted for, however, a significant heterogeneity emerges among the four clusters of papers, giving rise to new evidence on the formation of club-like convergence of literature outcomes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Tree-structured Knowledge Graph For Academic Insight Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research surveys have always posed a challenge for beginner researchers who lack of research training. These researchers struggle to understand the directions within their research topic, and the discovery of new research findings within a short time. One way to provide intuitive assistance to beginner researchers is by offering relevant knowledge graphs(KG) and recommending related academic papers. However, existing navigation knowledge graphs primarily rely on keywords in the research field and often fail to present the logical hierarchy among multiple related papers clearly. Moreover, most recommendation systems for academic papers simply rely on high text similarity, which can leave researchers confused as to why a particular article is being recommended. They may lack of grasp important information about the insight connection between "Issue resolved" and "Issue finding" that they hope to obtain. To address these issues, this study aims to support research insight surveys for beginner researchers by establishing a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects the inheritance insight of research topics and the relevance insight among the academic papers.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Citations in Scientific Articles Using ChatGPT: Identifying Potential Biases and Conflicts of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific articles play a crucial role in advancing knowledge and informing research directions. One key aspect of evaluating scientific articles is the analysis of citations, which provides insights into the impact and reception of the cited works. This article introduces the innovative use of large language models, particularly ChatGPT, for comprehensive sentiment analysis of citations within scientific articles. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ChatGPT can discern the nuanced positivity or negativity of citations, offering insights into the reception and impact of cited works. Furthermore, ChatGPT's capabilities extend to detecting potential biases and conflicts of interest in citations, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of scientific literature evaluation. This study showcases the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools in enhancing citation analysis and promoting integrity in scholarly research.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Global Narratives: A Multilingual Twitter Dataset of News Media on the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict has been a subject of intense media coverage worldwide. Understanding the global narrative surrounding this topic is crucial for researchers that aim to gain insights into its multifaceted dimensions. In this paper, we present a novel multimedia dataset that focuses on this topic by collecting and processing tweets posted by news or media companies on social media across the globe. We collected tweets from February 2022 to May 2023 to acquire approximately 1.5 million tweets in 60 different languages along with their images. Each entry in the dataset is accompanied by processed tags, allowing for the identification of entities, stances, textual or visual concepts, and sentiment. The availability of this multimedia dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to investigate the global narrative surrounding the ongoing conflict from various aspects such as who are the prominent entities involved, what stances are taken, where do these stances originate from, how are the different textual and visual concepts related to the event portrayed.</description>
