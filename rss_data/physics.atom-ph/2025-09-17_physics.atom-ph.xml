      <title>Elastic and Spin-Changing Cross Sections of Spin-Polarized Atomic Tritium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates of elastic and inelastic scattering processes of spin-polarized atomic tritium are vital inputs for the design and operation of experiments using cold, magnetically trapped tritium atoms. Elastic scattering dominates the total cross section and dictates the thermophysical properties of the vapor, determining the efficiency of magnetic evaporative cooling and the fluid dynamical properties of the trapped atom cloud. Spin-changing cross sections in both exchange and dipolar channels determine the trap lifetime of the various hyperfine states, imposing constraints on the required atomic tritium supply rate to maintain a given trap density. Motivated by the needs of next-generation spectrometers that will study the tritium beta endpoint to infer the mass of the neutrino, we present new calculations of the elastic, spin-exchange and dipolar cross sections for spin polarized atomic tritium. Cross sections and rate constants are reported for magnetic field strengths of 0-10 T and temperatures from 0-100~K in all relevant Zeeman-hyperfine channels for both tritium and hydrogen. Results are bench-marked against past calculations for atomic hydrogen and the limited available results for tritium, and extend far into the regimes where past calculations have not been available.</description>

      <title>A $^{3}$He-$^{21}$Ne Ramsey Comagnetometer with sub-nHz frequency resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spin comagnetometers offer exceptional precision in measurements of spin energy levels and exhibit long-term stability, making them powerful tools for probing spin-dependent physics beyond the Standard Model as well as for inertial rotation sensing. We describe a new $^{3}$He-$^{21}$Ne Ramsey comagnetometer operating with an in-situ $^{87}$Rb magnetometer for initialization and sensing of nuclear spins. During free precession of nuclear spins we turn off all lasers and introduce a microwave field to suppress back-action from Rb atoms. We demonstrate that scalar and dipolar interactions between nuclear spins can be eliminated via control of the polarized sample geometry. These improvements result in a bias-free measurement with a frequency sensitivity of 0.6 nHz after 6 hours of integration.</description>

      <title>Broadband femtosecond lasers enable efficient two-photon excitation of the ultranarrow linewidth singlet 1s2s state in helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a broadband, femtosecond two-photon excitation scheme for efficient population transfer to the ultra-narrow linewidth $1s2s\ ^1S_0$ metastable state in helium. Using $120$ nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) femtosecond laser pulses, we theoretically demonstrate that a direct two-photon excitation process can achieve a population transfer efficiency of $25-30\%$, even when photoionization losses are included. The use of broadband pulses enables multiple excitation pathways to populate the excited state, in addition to compensating for significant AC Stark shifts occurring within the pulse duration. Furthermore, we introduce a two-color two-photon extreme ultraviolet-near infrared (XUV-IR) excitation scheme that will further reduce ionization losses and can achieve significantly higher transfer efficiencies of $\sim 70\%$. These results demonstrate that high excitation probability of ultra-narrow linewidth ($\sim 50$ Hz) excited states can be achieved with experimentally accessible femtosecond laser sources with a few THz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>A compact Sr magneto-optical trap system for field-deployable optical lattice clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact strontium (Sr) magneto-optical trap (MOT) realized in a single vacuum chamber without a Zeeman slower or a two-dimensional MOT. The MOT is directly loaded from a thermal atomic beam generated by an atomic oven. The entire vacuum chamber is maintained by a single ion pump, without employing differential pumping. At an oven temperature of $395\,\mathrm{{}^\circ C}$, the number of atoms in the MOT reaches $10^7$ with a loading rate of $10^7 \,\mathrm{atoms\,s^{-1}}$, while sustaining a background gas pressure in the $10^{-9} \,\mathrm{Torr}$ range. At this oven temperature, the MOT lifetime limited by collisions with background gas is $\sim 5 \,\mathrm{s}$, with the atom number primarily constrained by light-assisted two-body collisions. Our MOT system significantly simplifies the construction of field-deployable optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <title>Improved systematic evaluation of a strontium optical clock with uncertainty below $1\times 10^{-18}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic uncertainty of $9.2\times 10^{-19}$ for the USTC Sr1 optical lattice clock, achieving accuracy at the level required for the roadmap of the redefinition of the SI second. A finite-element model with {\it in situ}-validated, spatially-resolved chamber emissivity reduced blackbody radiation shift uncertainty to $6.3\times 10^{-19}$. Concurrently, an externally mounted lattice cavity combined with a larger beam waist suppressed density shifts. Enhanced lattice depth modulation consolidated lattice light shift uncertainty to $6.3\times 10^{-19}$ by enabling simultaneous determination of key polarizabilities and magic wavelength. Magnetic shifts were resolved below $10^{-18}$ via precision characterization of the second-order Zeeman coefficient. Supported by a crystalline-coated ultra-low-expansion cavity-stabilized laser and refined temperature control suppressing BBR fluctuations, the clock also achieves a frequency stability better than $1\times10^{-18}$ at 30,000-s averaging time. These developments collectively establish a new benchmark in USTC Sr1 clock performance and pave the way for high-accuracy applications in metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Coherently enhanced decoherence and cloud substructure of atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how coherent scattering of a background gas off an atom (or other matter) interferometer can lead to enhanced signals from phase shifts and contrast loss. We focus on the inclusion of realistic features of atom interferometers such as finite temperature, cloud substructure, and time-dependent cloud radii. The inclusion of these effects, extending beyond the previously considered point-like cloud approximation, naturally allow us to study the smooth transition between the coherent and incoherent scattering regimes. We discuss how the formalism presented herein can be tested in the lab (with near-infrared photons or an eV-scale electron gun), and discuss an application for the detection of dark matter interacting via long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Frequency stability of $2.5\times10^{-17}$ in a Si cavity with AlGaAs crystalline mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in ultrastable lasers have fueled remarkable advances in optical frequency metrology and quantum science. A key ingredient in further improving laser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as AlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings limits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to similar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair of crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated at 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over dielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and corresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss factor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency averaging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency drift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years. These results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with $10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with continuously operating optical local oscillators.</description>

      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>

      <title>Simple Vector Magnetometer Based on Ground State Hanle Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2 line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal) dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.</description>

      <title>Multi-laser stabilization with an atomic-disciplined photonic integrated resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.</description>

      <title>Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>
