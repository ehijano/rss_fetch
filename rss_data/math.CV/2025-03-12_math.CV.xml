      <title>Boundary values and zeros of Harmonic Product of Complex-valued Harmonic Functions in a simply connected bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The product of two complex-valued harmonic function is not in general complex-valued harmonic function. In this paper we show that if a complex-valued harmonic function is the product of two complex-valued harmonic functions, then it is the difference of two squares, one is analytic and the other is co-analytic. As a result of this, if one of the factors of the product is known, then the other factor is expressed in terms of the known factor explicitly. As an application of this we determine the boundary value of one of the factors and the product provided the boundary value of the other factor is known. It is shown that the boundary value of the product is a pure imaginary constant. Moreover, if such a product and factors are complex-valued harmonic polynomials, then the number of zeros of the product is at most half of the square of its degree which is by half smaller than what is known in the literature about the maximum number of zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials. The feature of this paper is to explore multipliers for some subspace of complex-valued harmonic functions and determine some nontrivial invariant subspace.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Generalization of the Enestr\"{o}m-Kakeya Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {In 2020, Carney et.al. proved the quaternionic version of the Enestr\"{o}m-Kakeya Theorem, which states that a polynomial $p(q)=\sum_{\nu=0}^n q^\nu a_\nu$ with non-negative and monotonically increasing coefficients $(0&lt;a_0\le a_1\le \cdots \le a_n)$ has all of its zeros within the unit ball $|q|\le 1$. Numerous generalizations of Enestr\"{o}m-Kakeya Theorem are available in the literatures (\cite{m}-\cite{mmr}). In this paper, we extend some of these generalizations to the quaternionic context and present several potential results.}</description>

      <title>The translation geometry of P\'olya's shires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his shire theorem, G.~P\'olya proves that the zeros of iterated derivatives of a meromorphic function in the complex plane accumulate on the union of edges of the Voronoi diagram of the poles of this function. By recasting the local arguments of P\'olya into the language of translation surfaces, we prove its generalisation describing the asymptotic distribution of the zeros of a meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface under the iterations of a linear differential operator $T_\omega: f \mapsto \frac{df}{\omega}$ where $\omega$ is a given meromorphic $1$-form. The accumulation set of these zeros is the union of edges of a generalised Voronoi diagram defined by the initial function $f$ together with the singular flat metric on the Riemann surface induced by $\omega$. This result provides the ground for a novel approach to the problem of finding a flat geometric presentation of a translation surface initially defined in terms of algebraic or complex-analytic data.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspaces for Generalized Differentiation and Volterra Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a far-reaching generalization of the existent results about invariant subspaces of the differentiation operator $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ on $C^\infty(0,1)$ and the Volterra operator $Vf(t)=\int_0^tf(s)ds$, on $L^2(0,1)$. We use an abstract approach to study invariant subspaces of pairs $D,V$ with $DV=I$, where $V$ is compact and quasi-nilpotent and $D$ is unbounded densely defined and closed on the same Hilbert space. Our results cover many differential operators, like Schr\"odinger operators and a large class of other canonical systems, as well as the so-called compact self-adjoint operators with removable spectrum recently studied by Baranov and Yakubovich. Our methods are based on a model for such pairs which involves de Branges spaces of entire functions and plays a crucial role in the development. However, a number of difficulties arise from the fact that our abstract operators do not necessarily identify with the usual operators on such spaces, but with rank one perturbations of those, which, in terms of invariant subspaces creates a number of challenging problems.</description>

      <title>A counterexample of the Fredholm of Toeplitz operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the essential spectra of the Toeplitz operator on the Hardy space $H^1$. We give a counterexample to show that the Toeplitz operator with symbol is not Fredholm, which gives a counterexample to the conjecture by J.A. Virtanen J A in 2006.</description>

      <title>Variation of mixed Hodge structure and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss variations of mixed Hodge structure arising from projective morphisms of complex analytic spaces. Then we treat generalizations of Koll\'ar's torsion-free theorem, vanishing theorem, and so on, for reducible complex analytic spaces as an application. The results will play a crucial role in the theory of minimal models for projective morphisms between complex analytic spaces.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic reductions and the intrinsic depths in non-archimedean dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we aim at giving a more conceptual and simpler proof of Rumely's moduli theoretic characterization of type II minimal locus of the resultant function $\operatorname{ordRes}_\phi$ on the Berkovich hyperbolic space for a rational function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ defined over an algebraically closed and complete non-archimedean and non-trivially valued field, and also at making it sharper and simplifying the proof of the degenerating limit theorem of DeMarco--Faber for the family of the unique maximal entropy measures on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ associated to a meromorphic family of complex rational functions. For those aims, we introduce the intrinsic reduction of $\phi$ at each point in the Berkovich projective line and its directionwise intrinsic depths, which are defined in terms of the tree and analytic structures of the Berkovich projective line and are suitable languages, and then establish two theorems in non-archimedean dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vanishing theorems for Hodge numbers and the Calabi curvature operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a compact $n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold with $\frac{n}{2}$-positive Calabi curvature operator has the rational cohomology of complex projective space. For even $n,$ this is sharp in the sense that the complex quadric with its symmetric metric has $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator, yet $b_n =2.$ Furthermore, the compact K\"ahler manifolds with $\frac{n}{2}$-nonnegative Calabi curvature operator are completely classified. In addition, the previously known results for the K\"ahler curvature operator are improved when the metric is K\"ahler-Einstein.</description>
