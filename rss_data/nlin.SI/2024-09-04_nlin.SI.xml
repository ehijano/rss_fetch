      <title>Casting more light in the shadows: dual Somos-5 sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for an appropriate notion of a cluster superalgebra, incorporating Grassmann variables, Ovsienko and Tabachnikov considered the extension of various recurrence relations with the Laurent phenomenon to the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, by iterating recurrences with specific numerical values, some particular well-known integer sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, Markoff numbers, and Somos sequences, were shown to produce associated ``shadow'' sequences when they were extended to the dual numbers. Here we consider the most general version of the Somos-5 recurrence defined over the ring of dual numbers $\mathbb{D}$ with complex coefficients, that is the ring $\mathbb{C}[\varepsilon]$ modulo the relation $\varepsilon^2=0$. We present three different ways to present the general solution of the initial value problem for Somos-5 and its shadow part: in analytic form, using the Weierstrass sigma function with arguments in $\mathbb{D}$; in terms of the solution of a linear difference equation; and using Hankel determinants constructed from $\mathbb{D}$-valued moments, via a connection with a Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) map over the dual numbers.</description>

      <title>Totally Nonnegative Pfaffian for Solitons in BKP Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BKP equation is obtained from the reduction of B type in the KP hierarchy under the orthogonal type transformation group for the KP equation. The skew Schur Q functions can be used to construct the Tau functions of solitons in the BKP equation. Then the totally nonnegative Pfaffian can be defined via the skew Schur Q functions to obtain nonsingular line solitons solution in the BKP equation. The totally nonnegative Pfaffians are investigated. The line solitons interact to form web like structure in the near field region and their resonances appearing in soliton graph could be investigated by the totally nonnegative Pfaffians.</description>

      <title>The integrable semi-discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with nonzero backgrounds: Bilinearization-reduction approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the classical and nonlocal semi-discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (sdNLS) equations with nonzero backgrounds are solved by means of the bilinearization-reduction approach. In the first step of this approach, the unreduced sdNLS system with a nonzero background is bilinearized and its solutions are presented in terms of quasi double Casoratians. Then, reduction techniques are implemented to deal with complex and nonlocal reductions, which yields solutions for the four classical and nonlocal sdNLS equations with a plane wave background or a hyperbolic function background. These solutions are expressed with explicit formulae and allow classifications according to canonical forms of certain spectral matrix. In particular, we present explicit formulae for general rogue waves for the classical focusing sdNLS equation. Some obtained solutions are analyzed and illustrated.</description>

      <title>Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis geometry and integrable matrix PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two tensor fields of type (1,1) on a smooth n-dimensional manifold M, such that all their Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis brackets vanish, the algebra of differential forms on M becomes a bi-differential graded algebra. As a consequence, there are partial differential equation (PDE) systems associated with it, which arise as the integrability condition of a system of linear equations and possess a binary Darboux transformation to generate exact solutions. We recover chiral models and potential forms of the self-dual Yang-Mills, as well as corresponding generalizations to higher than four dimensions, and obtain new integrable non-autonomous nonlinear matrix PDEs and corresponding systems.</description>

      <title>Two-stage initial-value iterative physics-informed neural networks for simulating solitary waves of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new two-stage initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for solitary wave computations of nonlinear wave equations based on traditional numerical iterative methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, the IINN framework consists of two subnetworks, one of which is used to fit a given initial value, and the other incorporates physical information and continues training on the basis of the first subnetwork. Importantly, the IINN method does not require any additional data information including boundary conditions, apart from the given initial value. Corresponding theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IINN method. The proposed IINN method is efficiently applied to learn some types of solutions in different nonlinear wave equations, including the one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) equation (with and without potentials), the 1D saturable NLS equation with PT -symmetric optical lattices, the 1D focusing-defocusing coupled NLS equations, the KdV equation, the two-dimensional (2D) NLS equation with potentials, the 2D amended GP equation with a potential, the (2+1)-dimensional KP equation, and the 3D NLS equation with a potential. These applications serve as evidence for the efficacy of our method. Finally, by comparing with the traditional methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IINN method.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms, which in turn describe an abstract surface with a Gaussian curvature equal to $-1$. In our investigation, we identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve the set of solutions and establish conserved quantities. Through the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that explicitly provide metrics for the described surfaces. These solutions, however, exhibit an unbounded nature; notably, some appear in pairs that display a sort of "mirror symmetry" with respect to their bounded regions. To address this, we utilize both the conserved quantities and this symmetry to develop a process, which we term the "collage" method. This method effectively removes the unbounded parts from these pairs of solutions and seamlessly glues them together in a smooth manner. Consequently, this process results in weak solutions that remain consistent with the conserved quantities identified. The solutions produced through the collage process are pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than the peakon solutions of Camassa-Holm type equations. Moreover, we apply a Miura-type transformation that connects our original equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation. This transformation allows us to map the solutions from our initial equation to those of the Degasperis-Procesi equation. As a result, we uncover previously unnoticed phenomena, such as a solution to the Degasperis-Procesi equation that exhibits a novel combination of peakon and shock-peakon features, which appears to be unreported to date.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Lax pairs for the delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations and their reductions to delay Painleve equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations are delay-differential extensions of the well-known soliton equations, the Lotka-Volterra and Toda lattice equations, respectively. This paper investigates integrable properties of the delay Lotka-Volterra and delay Toda lattice equations, and study the relationships to the already known delay Painleve equations. First, Backlund transformations, Lax pairs and an infinite number of conserved quantities of these delay soliton equations are constructed. Then, applying spatial 2-periodic reductions to them, we show the known delay Painleve equations are derived. Using these reductions, we construct the N-soliton-type determinant solutions of the autonomous versions of delay Painleve equations, and the Casorati determinant solution of a higher order analogue of the discrete Painleve II equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>

      <title>Spectral quantization of discrete random walks on half-line, and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define quantization scheme for discrete-time random walks on the half-line consistent with Szegedy's quantization of finite Markov chains. Motivated by the Karlin and McGregor description of discrete-time random walks in terms of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure with support in the segment $[-1,1]$, we represent the unitary evolution operator of the quantum walk in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. We find the relation between transition probabilities of the random walk with the Verblunsky coefficients of the corresponding polynomials of the quantum walk. We show that the both polynomials systems and their measures are connected by the classical Szeg\H{o} map. Our scheme can be applied to arbitrary Karlin and McGregor random walks and generalizes the so called Cantero-Gr\"{u}nbaum-Moral-Vel\'{a}zquez method. We illustrate our approach on example of random walks related to the Jacobi polynomials. Then we study quantization of random walks with constant transition probabilities where the corresponding polynomials on the unit circle have two-periodic real Verblunsky coefficients. We present geometric construction of the spectrum of such polynomials (in the general complex case) which generalizes the known construction for the Geronimus polynomials. In the Appendix we present the explicit form, in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle and polynomials orthogonal on the real line with coefficients of arbitrary period.</description>

      <title>On the Lorenzoni-Magri hierarchy of hydrodynamic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>
