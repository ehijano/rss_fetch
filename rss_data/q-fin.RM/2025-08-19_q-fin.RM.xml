      <title>Mapping Microscopic and Systemic Risks in TradFi and DeFi: a literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the formation and propagation of systemic risks across traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a comparative framework that bridges these two increasingly interconnected ecosystems. We propose a conceptual model for systemic risk formation in TradFi, grounded in well-established mechanisms such as leverage cycles, liquidity crises, and interconnected institutional exposures. Extending this analysis to DeFi, we identify unique structural and technological characteristics - such as composability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and algorithm-driven mechanisms - that shape the emergence and transmission of risks within decentralized systems. Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight risks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity shocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently due to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability in DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how disruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political developments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing interdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance of understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually, but also at their intersection. Our findings contribute to the evolving discourse on risk management in a hybrid financial ecosystem, offering insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial stakeholders navigating this complex landscape.</description>

      <title>Dependence bounds for the difference of stop-loss payoffs on the difference of two random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the difference of stop-loss payoffs where the underlying is a difference of two random variables. The goal is to study whether the comonotonic and countermonotonic modifications of those two random variables can be used to construct upper and lower bounds for the expected payoff, despite the fact that the payoff function is neither convex nor concave. The answer to the central question of the paper requires studying the crossing points of the cdf of the original difference with the cdfs of its comonotonic and countermonotonic transforms. The analysis is supplemented with a numerical study of longevity trend bonds, using different mortality models and population data. The numerical study reveals that for these mortality-linked securities the three pairs of cdfs generally have unique pairwise crossing points. Under symmetric copulas, all crossing points can reasonably be approximated by the difference of the marginal medians, but this approximation is not necessarily valid for asymmetric copulas. Nevertheless, extreme dependence structures can give rise to bounds if the layers of the bond are selected to hedge tail risk. Further, the dependence uncertainty spread can be low if the layers are selected to hedge median risk, and, subject to a trade-off, to hedge tail risk as well.</description>

      <title>Optimal insurance design with Lambda-Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores optimal insurance solutions based on the Lambda-Value-at-Risk ($\Lambda\VaR$). If the expected value premium principle is used, our findings confirm that, similar to the VaR model, a truncated stop-loss indemnity is optimal in the $\Lambda\VaR$ model. We further provide a closed-form expression of the deductible parameter under certain conditions. Moreover, we study the use of a $\Lambda'\VaR$ as premium principle as well, and show that full or no insurance is optimal. Dual stop-loss is shown to be optimal if we use a $\Lambda'\VaR$ only to determine the risk-loading in the premium principle. Moreover, we study the impact of model uncertainty, considering situations where the loss distribution is unknown but falls within a defined uncertainty set. Our findings indicate that a truncated stop-loss indemnity is optimal when the uncertainty set is based on a likelihood ratio. However, when uncertainty arises from the first two moments of the loss variable, we provide the closed-form optimal deductible in a stop-loss indemnity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic reinsurance design with heterogeneous beliefs under the mean-variance framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the mean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the insurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility constraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled using the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in a risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, we apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one determined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance contracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss contracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous beliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive the parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution. Finally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer share identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is relaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief heterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.</description>

      <title>Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</description>
