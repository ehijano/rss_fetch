      <title>Ranking evaluation metrics from a group-theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confronted with the challenge of identifying the most suitable metric to validate the merits of newly proposed models, the decision-making process is anything but straightforward. Given that comparing rankings introduces its own set of formidable challenges and the likely absence of a universal metric applicable to all scenarios, the scenario does not get any better. Furthermore, metrics designed for specific contexts, such as for Recommender Systems, sometimes extend to other domains without a comprehensive grasp of their underlying mechanisms, resulting in unforeseen outcomes and potential misuses. Complicating matters further, distinct metrics may emphasize different aspects of rankings, frequently leading to seemingly contradictory comparisons of model results and hindering the trustworthiness of evaluations.
  We unveil these aspects in the domain of ranking evaluation metrics. Firstly, we show instances resulting in inconsistent evaluations, sources of potential mistrust in commonly used metrics; by quantifying the frequency of such disagreements, we prove that these are common in rankings. Afterward, we conceptualize rankings using the mathematical formalism of symmetric groups detaching from possible domains where the metrics have been created; through this approach, we can rigorously and formally establish essential mathematical properties for ranking evaluation metrics, essential for a deeper comprehension of the source of inconsistent evaluations. We conclude with a discussion, connecting our theoretical analysis to the practical applications, highlighting which properties are important in each domain where rankings are commonly evaluated. In conclusion, our analysis sheds light on ranking evaluation metrics, highlighting that inconsistent evaluations should not be seen as a source of mistrust but as the need to carefully choose how to evaluate our models in the future.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural content and advertisement coexist in industrial recommendation systems but differ in data distribution. Concretely, traffic related to the advertisement is considerably sparser compared to that of natural content, which motivates the development of transferring knowledge from the richer source natural content domain to the sparser advertising domain. The challenges include the inefficiencies arising from the management of extensive source data and the problem of 'catastrophic forgetting' that results from the CTR model's daily updating. To this end, we propose a novel tri-level asynchronous framework, i.e., Efficient Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction (E-CDCTR), to transfer comprehensive knowledge of natural content to advertisement CTR models. This framework consists of three key components: Tiny Pre-training Model ((TPM), which trains a tiny CTR model with several basic features on long-term natural data; Complete Pre-training Model (CPM), which trains a CTR model holding network structure and input features the same as target advertisement on short-term natural data; Advertisement CTR model (A-CTR), which derives its parameter initialization from CPM together with multiple historical embeddings from TPM as extra feature and then fine-tunes on advertisement data. TPM provides richer representations of user and item for both the CPM and A-CTR, effectively alleviating the forgetting problem inherent in the daily updates. CPM further enhances the advertisement model by providing knowledgeable initialization, thereby alleviating the data sparsity challenges typically encountered by advertising CTR models. Such a tri-level cross-domain transfer learning framework offers an efficient solution to address both data sparsity and `catastrophic forgetting', yielding remarkable improvements.</description>

      <title>SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale test collections play a crucial role in Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, according to the Cranfield paradigm and the research into publicly available datasets, the existing information retrieval research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments - a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost. In this paper, to address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset, we extend the TREC Deep Learning Track (DL) test collection via additional language model synthetic labels to enable researchers to test and evaluate their search systems at a large scale. Specifically, such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from the previous years of tracks. We compare system evaluation with past human labels from past years and find that our synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.</description>

      <title>Do Recommender Systems Promote Local Music? A Reproducibility Study Using Music Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the influence of recommender systems on local music representation, discussing prior findings from an empirical study on the LFM-2b public dataset. This prior study argued that different recommender systems exhibit algorithmic biases shifting music consumption either towards or against local content. However, LFM-2b users do not reflect the diverse audience of music streaming services. To assess the robustness of this study's conclusions, we conduct a comparative analysis using proprietary listening data from a global music streaming service, which we publicly release alongside this paper. We observe significant differences in local music consumption patterns between our dataset and LFM-2b, suggesting that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions on local music based solely on LFM-2b. Moreover, we show that the algorithmic biases exhibited in the original work vary in our dataset, and that several unexplored model parameters can significantly influence these biases and affect the study's conclusion on both datasets. Finally, we discuss the complexity of accurately labeling local music, emphasizing the risk of misleading conclusions due to unreliable, biased, or incomplete labels. To encourage further research and ensure reproducibility, we have publicly shared our dataset and code.</description>

      <title>Transformers Meet ACT-R: Repeat-Aware and Sequential Listening Session Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music streaming services often leverage sequential recommender systems to predict the best music to showcase to users based on past sequences of listening sessions. Nonetheless, most sequential recommendation methods ignore or insufficiently account for repetitive behaviors. This is a crucial limitation for music recommendation, as repeatedly listening to the same song over time is a common phenomenon that can even change the way users perceive this song. In this paper, we introduce PISA (Psychology-Informed Session embedding using ACT-R), a session-level sequential recommender system that overcomes this limitation. PISA employs a Transformer architecture learning embedding representations of listening sessions and users using attention mechanisms inspired by Anderson's ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational), a cognitive architecture modeling human information access and memory dynamics. This approach enables us to capture dynamic and repetitive patterns from user behaviors, allowing us to effectively predict the songs they will listen to in subsequent sessions, whether they are repeated or new ones. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of PISA using both publicly available listening data from Last.fm and proprietary data from Deezer, a global music streaming service, confirming the critical importance of repetition modeling for sequential listening session recommendation. Along with this paper, we publicly release our proprietary dataset to foster future research in this field, as well as the source code of PISA to facilitate its future use.</description>

      <title>Jina-ColBERT-v2: A General-Purpose Multilingual Late Interaction Retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce several improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, leveraging techniques successful in the more established single-vector embedding model paradigm, particularly those suited for heterogeneous multilingual data. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks, while also cutting storage requirements by up to 50% compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>An Extremely Data-efficient and Generative LLM-based Reinforcement Learning Agent for Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled understanding webpage contexts, product details, and human instructions. Utilizing LLMs as the foundational architecture for either reward models or policies in reinforcement learning has gained popularity -- a notable achievement is the success of InstructGPT. RL algorithms have been instrumental in maximizing long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopic goals in industrial recommender systems, which often rely on deep learning models to predict immediate clicks or purchases.
  In this project, several RL methods are implemented and evaluated using the WebShop benchmark environment, data, simulator, and pre-trained model checkpoints. The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize the purchase reward given a detailed human instruction describing a desired product. The RL agents are developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with various objectives, learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporary training techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used in InstructGPT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This report also evaluates the RL agents trained using generative trajectories. Evaluations were conducted using Thompson sampling in the WebShop simulator environment.
  The simulated online experiments demonstrate that agents trained on generated trajectories exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using human trajectories. This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-cost data-efficient way of training reinforcement learning agents. Also, with limited training time (&lt;2hours), without utilizing any images, a DPO agent achieved a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes of training on T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate.</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-NN Search in IoT Data: Overlap Optimization in Tree-Based Indexing Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of interconnected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an exponential increase in data, commonly known as Big IoT Data. Efficient retrieval of this heterogeneous data demands a robust indexing mechanism for effective organization. However, a significant challenge remains: the overlap in data space partitions during index construction. This overlap increases node access during search and retrieval, resulting in higher resource consumption, performance bottlenecks, and impedes system scalability. To address this issue, we propose three innovative heuristics designed to quantify and strategically reduce data space partition overlap. The volume-based method (VBM) offers a detailed assessment by calculating the intersection volume between partitions, providing deeper insights into spatial relationships. The distance-based method (DBM) enhances efficiency by using the distance between partition centers and radii to evaluate overlap, offering a streamlined yet accurate approach. Finally, the object-based method (OBM) provides a practical solution by counting objects across multiple partitions, delivering an intuitive understanding of data space dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing search time, underscoring their potential to improve data space partitioning and enhance overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Sparse Lexical Representations for Image Retrieval in the Age of Rising Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink sparse lexical representations for image retrieval. By utilizing multi-modal large language models (M-LLMs) that support visual prompting, we can extract image features and convert them into textual data, enabling us to utilize efficient sparse retrieval algorithms employed in natural language processing for image retrieval tasks. To assist the LLM in extracting image features, we apply data augmentation techniques for key expansion and analyze the impact with a metric for relevance between images and textual data. We empirically show the superior precision and recall performance of our image retrieval method compared to conventional vision-language model-based methods on the MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and NUS-WIDE datasets in a keyword-based image retrieval scenario, where keywords serve as search queries. We also demonstrate that the retrieval performance can be improved by iteratively incorporating keywords into search queries.</description>

      <title>Is text normalization relevant for classifying medieval charters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of historical text normalization on the classification of medieval charters, specifically focusing on document dating and locating. Using a data set of Middle High German charters from a digital archive, we evaluate various classifiers, including traditional and transformer-based models, with and without normalization. Our results indicate that the given normalization minimally improves locating tasks but reduces accuracy for dating, implying that original texts contain crucial features that normalization may obscure. We find that support vector machines and gradient boosting outperform other models, questioning the efficiency of transformers for this use case. Results suggest a selective approach to historical text normalization, emphasizing the significance of preserving some textual characteristics that are critical for classification tasks in document analysis.</description>

      <title>GenRec: Generative Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data and recommend next items for the user. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Smart Multi-Modal Search: Contextual Sparse and Dense Embedding Integration in Adobe Express</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As user content and queries become increasingly multi-modal, the need for effective multi-modal search systems has grown. Traditional search systems often rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while multi-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image embeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating contextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable multi-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper presents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that optimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template search. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles of embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse embeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense, and contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly reduces null rates (over 70\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our findings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems, thereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.</description>

      <title>Summaries, Highlights, and Action items: Design, implementation and evaluation of an LLM-powered meeting recap system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meetings play a critical infrastructural role in the coordination of work. In recent years, due to shift to hybrid and remote work, more meetings are moving to online Computer Mediated Spaces. This has led to new problems (e.g. more time spent in less engaging meetings) and new opportunities (e.g. automated transcription/captioning and recap support). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for dialog summarization have the potential to improve the experience of meetings by reducing individuals' meeting load and increasing the clarity and alignment of meeting outputs. Despite this potential, they face technological limitation due to long transcripts and inability to capture diverse recap needs based on user's context. To address these gaps, we design, implement and evaluate in-context a meeting recap system. We first conceptualize two salient recap representations -- important highlights, and a structured, hierarchical minutes view. We develop a system to operationalize the representations with dialogue summarization as its building blocks. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the system with seven users in the context of their work meetings. Our findings show promise in using LLM-based dialogue summarization for meeting recap and the need for both representations in different contexts. However, we find that LLM-based recap still lacks an understanding of whats personally relevant to participants, can miss important details, and mis-attributions can be detrimental to group dynamics. We identify collaboration opportunities such as a shared recap document that a high quality recap enables. We report on implications for designing AI systems to partner with users to learn and improve from natural interactions to overcome the limitations related to personal relevance and summarization quality.</description>

      <title>From Data Creator to Data Reuser: Distance Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharing research data is necessary, but not sufficient, for data reuse. Open science policies focus more heavily on data sharing than on reuse, yet both are complex, labor-intensive, expensive, and require infrastructure investments by multiple stakeholders. The value of data reuse lies in relationships between creators and reusers. By addressing knowledge exchange, rather than mere transactions between stakeholders, investments in data management and knowledge infrastructures can be made more wisely. Drawing upon empirical studies of data sharing and reuse, we develop the theoretical construct of distance between data creator and data reuser, identifying six distance dimensions that influence the ability to transfer knowledge effectively: domain, methods, collaboration, curation, purposes, and time and temporality. We address the social and socio-technical aspects of these dimensions, exploring ways in which they may decrease -- or increase -- distances between creators and reusers. Our theoretical framing of the distance between data creators and prospective reusers leads to recommendations to four categories of stakeholders on how to make data sharing and reuse more effective: data creators, data reusers, data archivists, and funding agencies. 'It takes a village' to share research data -- and a village to reuse data. Our aim is to provoke new research questions, new research, and new investments in effective and efficient circulation of research data; and to identify criteria for investments at each stage of data and research life cycles.</description>
