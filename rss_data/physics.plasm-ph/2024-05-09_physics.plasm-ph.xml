      <title>Highest Fusion Performance without Harmful Edge Energy Bursts in Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path of tokamak fusion and ITER is maintaining high-performance plasma to produce sufficient fusion power. This effort is hindered by the transient energy burst arising from the instabilities at the boundary of high-confinement plasmas. The application of 3D magnetic perturbations is the method in ITER and possibly in future fusion power plants to suppress this instability and avoid energy busts damaging the device. Unfortunately, the conventional use of the 3D field in tokamaks typically leads to degraded fusion performance and an increased risk of other plasma instabilities, two severe issues for reactor implementation. In this work, we present an innovative 3D field optimization, exploiting machine learning, real-time adaptability, and multi-device capabilities to overcome these limitations. This integrated scheme is successfully deployed on DIII-D and KSTAR tokamaks, consistently achieving reactor-relevant core confinement and the highest fusion performance without triggering damaging instabilities or bursts while demonstrating ITER-relevant automated 3D optimization for the first time. This is enabled both by advances in the physics understanding of self-organized transport in the plasma edge and by advances in machine-learning technology, which is used to optimize the 3D field spectrum for automated management of a volatile and complex system. These findings establish real-time adaptive 3D field optimization as a crucial tool for ITER and future reactors to maximize fusion performance while simultaneously minimizing damage to machine components.</description>

      <title>Sheet model description of spatio-temporal evolution of upper-hybrid oscillations in an inhomogeneous magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal evolution of large amplitude upper hybrid oscillations in a cold homogeneous plasma in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field is studied analytically and numerically using the Dawson sheet model. It is observed that the inhomogeneity in magnetic field which causes the upper hybrid frequency to acquire a spatial dependence, results in phase mixing and subsequent breaking of the upper hybrid oscillations at arbitrarily low amplitudes. This result is in sharp contrast to the usual upper hybrid oscillations in a homogeneous magnetic field where the oscillations break within a fraction of a period when the amplitude exceeds a certain critical value. Our perturbative calculations show that the phase mixing (wave breaking) time scales inversely with the amplitude of magnetic field inhomogeneity ($\Delta$) and amplitude of imposed density perturbation ($\delta$), and scales directly with the ratio of magnetic field inhomogeneity scale length to imposed density perturbation scale length ($(\alpha/k_L)^{-1}$ ) as $\omega_{pe}\tau_{mix} \sim \left( 1+\beta^2 \right) ^{3/2}k_L/(\beta^2\delta\Delta\alpha)$, where $\beta$ is the ratio of electron cyclotron frequency to electron plasma frequency. Further phase mixing time measured in simulations, performed using a 1-1/2 D code based on Dawson sheet model, shows good agreement with the above mentioned scaling. This result may be of relevance to plasma based particle acceleration experiments in the presence of a transverse inhomogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Exploration on the Low-Pressure Ar-O2 Plasma Generated by Low-Frequency Alternating Current (AC) Power Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports a low-frequency alternating current (AC) power supply as a novel approach for generating low-pressure capacitively coupled Ar-O2 plasma, offering advantages in cost, compactness, and operational simplicity, which are crucial for both material science and biological applications. The effectiveness of low-frequency AC-generated plasma against traditional RF systems by examining key plasma parameters such as electron density, electron temperature, and electron energy distribution function (EEDF), are investigated. Experimental results revealed that AC power supply could effectively produce low pressure Ar-O2 plasma with comparable properties to RF systems. Most notably, the AC-generated plasma achieved a significant reduction in bacterial growth, suggesting its potential as a more economical and flexible alternative for enhancing plasma-assisted applications in sterilization and material processing.</description>

      <title>Drift-Energy Replacement Effect in Multi-Ion Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast rotation can improve the stability and confinement of fusion plasmas. However, to maintain a rapidly rotating fusion plasma in steady state, significant energy must be invested in spinning up each incoming fuel ion. We show here that, under the right circumstances, collisional cross-field radial fueling can directly transfer drift energy between outgoing and incoming ions without the need for external power recirculation, thereby reducing the energy costs of maintaining the rotation.</description>

      <title>Upper and Lower Bounds on Phase-Space Rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad classes of plasma phenomena can be understood in terms of phase-space rearrangements. For example, the net effect of a wave-particle interaction may consist of moving populations of particles from one region of phase space to another. Different phenomena drive rearrangements that obey different rules. When those rules can be specified, it is possible to calculate bounds that limit the possible effects the rearrangement could have (such as limits on how much energy can be extracted from the particles). This leads to two problems. The first is to understand the mapping between the allowed class of rearrangements and the possible outcomes that these rearrangements can have on the overall distribution. The second is to understand which rules are appropriate for which physical systems. There has been recent progress on both fronts, but a variety of interesting questions remain.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination and vibrational excitation of BF$^{+}$ in low energy electron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest molecular data - potential energy curves and Rydberg-valence interactions - characterising the super-excited electronic states of BF are reviewed in order to provide the input for the study of their fragmentation dynamics. Starting from this input, the main paths and mechanisms of BF$^+$ dissociative recombination and vibrational excitation are analysed. Their cross sections are computed for the first time using a method based on the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT), and Maxwellian rate-coefficients are calculated and displayed in ready-to-be-used format for low temperature plasma kinetics simulations.</description>

      <title>Diag2Diag: Multi modal super resolution for physics discovery with application to fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a groundbreaking multi-modal neural network model designed for resolution enhancement, which innovatively leverages inter-diagnostic correlations within a system. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on uni-modal enhancement strategies, such as pixel-based image enhancement or heuristic signal interpolation. In contrast, our model employs a novel methodology by harnessing the diagnostic relationships within the physics of fusion plasma. Initially, we establish the correlation among diagnostics within the tokamak. Subsequently, we utilize these correlations to substantially enhance the temporal resolution of the Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which assesses plasma density and temperature. By increasing its resolution from conventional 200Hz to 500kHz, we facilitate a new level of insight into plasma behavior, previously attainable only through computationally intensive simulations. This enhancement goes beyond simple interpolation, offering novel perspectives on the underlying physical phenomena governing plasma dynamics.</description>
