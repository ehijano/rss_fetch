      <title>ColdPress: Efficient Quantile-Based Compression of Photometric Redshift PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF), ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind &amp; Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available at https://github.com/ahc-photoz/coldpress-project.</description>

      <title>Astro-MoE: Mixture of Experts for Multiband Astronomical Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiband astronomical time series exhibit heterogeneous variability patterns, sampling cadences, and signal characteristics across bands. Standard transformers apply shared parameters to all bands, potentially limiting their ability to model this rich structure. In this work, we introduce Astro-MoE, a foundational transformer architecture that enables dynamic processing via a Mixture of Experts module. We validate our model on both simulated (ELAsTiCC-1) and real-world datasets (Pan-STARRS1).</description>

      <title>A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)&lt;0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Data Movement Model for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sky images captured nightly by the camera on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's telescope will be processed across facilities on three continents. Data acquisition will occur at the observatory's location on Cerro Pach\'{o}n in the Andes mountains of Chile. A first copy of the raw image data set is stored at the summit and immediately transmitted via dedicated network links to the archive center within the US Data Facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, USA and from there to two European facilities for processing and archiving purposes. Data products resulting from periodic processing campaigns of the entire set of images collected since the beginning of the survey are made available to the scientific community in the form of data releases.
  In this paper we present an overall view of how we leverage the tools selected for managing the movement of data among the Rubin processing and serving facilities, including Rucio and FTS. We also present the tools we developed to integrate Rucio's data model and Rubin's Data Butler, the software abstraction layer that mediates all access to storage by pipeline tasks that implement science algorithms.</description>

      <title>(Exhaustive) Symbolic Regression and model selection by minimum description length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-Motivated Error Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{raccoon}$: A Python package for removing wiggle artifacts in the JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\texttt{raccoon}$ is a Python package for removing resampling noise - commonly referred to as "wiggles'' - from spaxel-level spectra in datacubes obtained from the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph's (NIRSpec) integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode. These wiggles arise as artifacts during resampling of the 2D raw data into 3D datacubes, due to the point spread function (PSF) being undersampled. The standard JWST data reduction pipeline does not correct for this noise. The wiggle artifacts can significantly degrade the scientific usability of the data, particularly at the spaxel level, undermining the exquisite spatial resolution of NIRSpec. $\texttt{raccoon}$ provides an empirical correction by modeling and removing these artifacts, thereby restoring the fidelity of the extracted spectra. $\texttt{raccoon}$ forward-models the wiggles as a chirp function impacting one or more template spectra that are directly fit to the original data across the entire wavelength range. The best-fit wiggle model is then used to clean the data while propagating the associated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Space-based mm/mg-scale Laser Interferometer for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <title>CubeSat Orbit Insertion Maneuvering Using J2 Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task, primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.</description>

      <title>An Atlas of Spectroheliograms from 3641 to 6600 \AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral atlas of solar spectroheliograms covering the wavelength range from 3641 to 6600 \AA, with continuous coverage between 3711 and 5300 \AA, and sparser coverage beyond this range. The spectral resolution varies between R $\sim$ 20 000 and 40 000, with a spectral step size between 60 and 90 m\AA, while the spatial resolution averages around 2.5 arcseconds. These observations were acquired over three months during the 2025 solar maximum, using amateur spectroheliographs (Sol'Ex and ML Astro SHG 700). The atlas is accessible via an interactive online platform with navigation tools and direct access to individual spectroheliograms.</description>

      <title>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light pollution is an increasing environmental concern, impacting both ecological systems and human health. This report presents an analysis of light pollution data from the washetdonker.nl SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These findings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and offer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform light pollution mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Systematic Effects Using the Inferred Initial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employed the SELFI algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilised to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of $N$-body simulations. Second, we obtained a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we relied on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution with COLA and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m}, \sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.</description>

Abstract: Stellar contamination has long been recognized as a major bottleneck in transmission spectroscopy, limiting our ability to accurately characterize exoplanet atmospheres-particularly for terrestrial worlds. In response, significant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as a potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the 500-hour JWST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program. However, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar effects remains mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with the extensiveexploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this study, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. At 12.8 um, none of the considered bare surface types-basalt, ultramafic, Fe-oxidized, and granitoid-can be reliably distinguished when accounting for the 3 sigma model precision between SPHINX and PHOENIX. At 15.0 um, only the granitoid surface is distinguishable from all others above this threshold. These results show that stellar model uncertainty alone substantially limits our ability to constrain surface composition from photometric data, even before including other sources of uncertainty such as stellar radius. Also, we find that current 15 um eclipse depth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 60 ppm difference for M8 and 20 ppm for M5 stars. This model discrepancy leads to a degeneracy in retrieved planetary albedos and weakens constraints on the presence of an atmosphere. We therefore recommend that future JWST secondary eclipse observations systematically include stellar mid-infrared spectroscopy to mitigate these uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2025 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>

Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>
