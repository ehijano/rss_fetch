      <title>Multi-category solar radio burst detection based on task-aligned one-stage object detection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of solar radio bursts (SRBs) is essential for advancing research in solar physics and predicting space weather. However, the majority of current studies mainly concentrate on detecting whether SRBs are present or absent, often focusing on only one particular type of burst. Moreover, the neural network models used for SRB detection are typically complex, involving a large number of parameters, which results in slower processing speeds. This study establishes a dataset encompassing Type II, Type III, Type IIIs, Type IV, and Type V SRBs collected from e-CALLISTO, including 8,752 SRB spectrum images and achieving annotations for 10,822 SRBs. We propose a multi-category SRB detection model based on task-aligned one-stage object detection (TOOD). TOOD can solve the problem of inconsistent predictions in classification and localization tasks, and it improves the detection recall rate. This model aligns classification and localization tasks and optimizes the neck network by incorporating a channel attention mechanism. This model achieves higher recall and accuracy with fewer parameters. This model can accurately detect five types of SBRs. The experimental results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 79.9\% (AP50) and a recall rate of 95.1\% on the SBRs dataset. A higher recall rate than other models means fewer SRBs are missed in automatic detection. The model we propose has the potential to make a substantial impact on solar physics research and space weather studies. Additionally, the findings in this paper could provide valuable insights for processing other small-sample astronomical datasets.The source code and data is available at https://github.com/onewangqianqian/MobileNetVitv2-TOOD.git.</description>

      <title>AREPO-IDORT: Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport for Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics on an Unstructured Moving Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.</description>

      <title>A Formalism for Calibrating the Instrumental Polarization of Radio Interferometric Arrays at Meter Wavelengths using Unpolarized Sky: A Demonstration using the MWA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration of instrumental polarization is critical for measuring polarized radio emissions from astrophysical sources to extract the magnetic field information in astrophysical, heliospheric, and terrestrial plasmas. At meter wavelengths, calibration of radio polarimetric observations is particularly challenging because of the scarcity of bright polarized sources due to significant Faraday depolarization. Here, we present a novel formalism for polarization calibration using an unpolarized sky model. The formalism is specifically designed for wide-field, low-frequency instruments like the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LoFAR (NenuFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), low-frequency telescope of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO-low), etc. By leveraging the apparent polarization of the unpolarized sky induced by the polarized primary beam of the radio telescope, this method avoids dependence on bright polarized calibrators. It is also immune to ionospheric Faraday rotation. The validation of the approach via MWA observations confirms the accuracy of the method. This formalism provides a robust framework for low-frequency polarization calibration. It addresses the longstanding calibration challenges and advances the field of low-frequency polarimetry by enabling polarization studies of astrophysical radio sources.</description>

      <title>Making the unmodulated pyramid wavefront sensor smart II. First on-sky demonstration of extreme adaptive optics with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at &gt;2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (&gt;3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.</description>

      <title>Deep-TAO: The Deep Learning Transient Astronomical Object data set for Astronomical Transient Event Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Deep-learning Transient Astronomical Object (Deep-TAO), a dataset of 1,249,079 annotated images from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, including 3,807 transient and 12,500 non-transient sequences. Deep-TAO has been curated to provide a clean, open-access, and user-friendly resource for benchmarking deep learning models. Deep-TAO covers transient classes such as blazars, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, supernovae, and events of indeterminate nature. The dataset is publicly available in FITS format, with Python routines and Jupyter notebooks for easy data manipulation. Using Deep-TAO, a baseline Convolutional Neural Network outperformed traditional random forest classifiers trained on light curves, demonstrating its potential for advancing transient classification.</description>

      <title>A parameter scan of dark zone maintenance for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets using theoretical and experimental implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining wavefront stability while directly imaging exoplanets over long exposure times is an ongoing problem in the field of high-contrast imaging. Robust and efficient high-order wavefront sensing and control systems are required for maintaining wavefront stability to counteract mechanical and thermal instabilities. Dark zone maintenance (DZM) has been proposed to address quasi-static optical aberrations and maintain high levels of contrast for coronagraphic space telescopes. To further experimentally test this approach for future missions, such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, this paper quantifies the differences between the theoretical closed-loop contrast bounds and DZM performance on the High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes(HiCAT) testbed. The quantification of DZM is achieved by traversing important parameters of the system, specifically the total direct photon rate entering the aperture of the instrument, ranging from $1.85 \times 10^6$ to $1.85 \times 10^8$ photons per second, and the wavefront error drift rate, ranging from $\sigma_{drift}$ = 0.3 - 3 $nm/\sqrt{iteration}$, injected via the deformable mirror actuators. This is tested on the HiCAT testbed by injecting random walk drifts using two Boston Micromachines kilo deformable mirrors (DMs). The parameter scan is run on the HiCAT simulator and the HiCAT testbed where the corresponding results are compared to the model-based theoretical contrast bounds to analyze discrepancies. The results indicate an approximate one and a half order of magnitude difference between the theoretical bounds and testbed results.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Model of Star Speckles for Learning to Detect and Characterize Exoplanets in Direct Imaging Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exoplanets is an active field in astronomy, with direct imaging as one of the most challenging methods due to faint exoplanet signals buried within stronger residual starlight. Successful detection requires advanced image processing to separate the exoplanet signal from this nuisance component. This paper presents a novel statistical model that captures nuisance fluctuations using a multi-scale approach, leveraging problem symmetries and a joint spectral channel representation grounded in physical principles. Our model integrates into an interpretable, end-to-end learnable framework for simultaneous exoplanet detection and flux estimation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against the state of the art using datasets from the SPHERE instrument operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). It significantly improves the precision-recall trade-off, notably on challenging datasets that are otherwise unusable by astronomers. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, robust to varying data quality, and well suited for large-scale observational surveys.</description>

      <title>Maximum-likelihood regression with systematic errors for astronomy and the physical sciences: II. Hypothesis testing of nested model components for Poisson data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel model of systematic errors for the regression of Poisson data is applied to hypothesis testing of nested model components with the introduction of a generalization of the $\Delta C$ statistic that applies in the presence of systematic errors. This paper shows that the null-hypothesis parent distribution of this $\Delta C_{sys}$ statistic can be obtained either through a simple numerical procedure, or in a closed form by making certain simplifying assumptions. It is found that the effects of systematic errors on the test statistic can be significant, and therefore the inclusion of sources of systematic errors is crucial for the assessment of the significance of nested model component in practical applications. The methods proposed in this paper provide a simple and accurate means of including systematic errors for hypothesis testing of nested model components in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>NEIDSpecMatch: stellar parameter estimation with NEID spectra using an empirical library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NEIDSpecMatch, a tool developed to extract stellar parameters from spectra obtained with the NEID spectrograph. NEIDSpecMatch is based on SpecMatch-Emp and HPFSpecMatch, which estimate stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectrum to well-characterized library spectra. This approach has proven effective for M dwarfs. Utilizing a library of 78 stellar spectra covering effective temperatures from $3000-6000$ K, NEIDSpecMatch derives key parameters, including effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Cross-validation shows median uncertainties of $\sigma_{T_{\mathrm{eff}}} = 115\,\mathrm{K}$, $\sigma_{[\mathrm{Fe/H}]} = 0.143$, and $\sigma_{\log g} = 0.073$ across 49 orders. We showcase its application by fitting the spectrum of an M-dwarf and discuss its utility across a wide range of spectra observed with NEID. NEIDSpecMatch is pip-installable.</description>

      <title>GraFIT: A toolbox for fast and accurate frequency response identification in Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency response function (FRF) measurements are widely used in Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors, e.g., for the design of controllers, calibrating signals and diagnostic problems with system dynamics. The aim of this paper is to present GraFIT: a toolbox that enables fast, inexpensive, and accurate identification of FRF measurements for GW detectors compared to the commonly used approaches, including common spectral analysis techniques. The toolbox consists of a single function to estimate the frequency response function for both open-loop and closed-loop systems and for arbitrary input and output dimensions. The toolbox is validated on two experimental case studies of the Virgo detector, illustrating more than a factor 3 reduction in standard deviation of the estimate for the same measurement times, and comparable standard deviations with up to 10 times less data for the new method with respect to the currently implemented Spectral Analysis method.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). III. Retrieval of Planetary Masses in Binaries Using the N-body Model with RV and Astrometry Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that secular perturbations in a binary system not only excite high orbital eccentricities but also alter the planetary orbital inclination, the classical Keplerian orbital model is no longer applicable for orbital retrieval. The combination of a dynamical model and observational data is essential for characterizing the configuration and planetary mass in close binaries. We calculate the theoretical radial velocity (RV) signal in the N-body framework and observe a drift in the RV semi-amplitude, which leads to a reduction in the $m$sin$i$ detection threshold by 20 $M_{\oplus}$, with $\sim$ 100% detection probability in the $m_1$sin$i_1$-$a_1$ parameter space. High-precision RV data with an accuracy of 1 m/s can detect such dynamical effects. For four close-in binaries-GJ 86, GJ 3021, HD 196885, and HD 41004, the deviation between the minimum mass derived from the Keplerian and N-body models is found to be $&gt; 0.2 ~ M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. High-precision astrometric data are also necessary to resolve the 3D orbits and true masses exoplanets. We generate astrometric simulation data with accuracies corresponding to Gaia (57.8 $\mu$as) and the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) (1 $\mu$as), respectively. Joint orbit fitting is performed for RV + Gaia and RV + CHES synergy methods. Compared with the fitting results from the astrometry-only model, the synergy models more effectively constrain the range of orbital inclinations. Using simulation data, we derive precise uncertainties for the true planetary mass, which are critical for determining the evolution of planets around binary stars and multi-planet systems.</description>

Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is proposed. In the conventional Geiger mode, the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below TC and displays calorimetric sensitivity in the range of 15 to 250 absorbed-photon energy equivalent for a photon beam with a wavelength of 515 nm. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 560 ps. Dual-mode SNSPDs may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</description>
