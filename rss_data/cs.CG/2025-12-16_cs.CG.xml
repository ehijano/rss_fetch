      <title>Efficiently Approximating the Minimum-Volume Bounding Box of a Point Set in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$We present an efficient $O (n + 1/\varepsilon^{4.5})$-time algorithm for computing a $(1+\varepsilon$)-approximation of the minimum-volume bounding box of $n$ points in $\Re^3$. We also present a simpler algorithm (for the same purpose) whose running time is $O (n \log{n} + n / \varepsilon^3)$. We give some experimental results with implementations of various variants of the second algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm described in this paper is available online https://github.com/sarielhp/MVBB.</description>

      <title>Continuous Edit Distance, Geodesics and Barycenters of Time-varying Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Continuous Edit Distance (CED), a geodesic and elastic distance for time-varying persistence diagrams (TVPDs). The CED extends edit-distance ideas to TVPDs by combining local substitution costs with penalized deletions/insertions, controlled by two parameters: \(\alpha\) (trade-off between temporal misalignment and diagram discrepancy) and \(\beta\) (gap penalty). We also provide an explicit construction of CED-geodesics. Building on these ingredients, we present two practical barycenter solvers, one stochastic and one greedy, that monotonically decrease the CED Frechet energy. Empirically, the CED is robust to additive perturbations (both temporal and spatial), recovers temporal shifts, and supports temporal pattern search. On real-life datasets, the CED achieves clustering performance comparable or better than standard elastic dissimilarities, while our clustering based on CED-barycenters yields superior classification results. Overall, the CED equips TVPD analysis with a principled distance, interpretable geodesics, and practical barycenters, enabling alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering directly in the space of TVPDs. A C++ implementation is provided for reproducibility at the following address https://github.com/sebastien-tchitchek/ContinuousEditDistance.</description>

      <title>VoroLight: Learning Quality Volumetric Voronoi Meshes from General Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VoroLight, a differentiable framework for 3D shape reconstruction based on Voronoi meshing. Our approach generates smooth, watertight surfaces and topologically consistent volumetric meshes directly from diverse inputs, including images, implicit shape level-set fields, point clouds and meshes. VoroLight operates in three stages: it first initializes a surface using a differentiable Voronoi formulation, then refines surface quality through a polygon-face sphere training stage, and finally reuses the differentiable Voronoi formulation for volumetric optimization with additional interior generator points.

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: On the Stability of Modern Vector Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vector databases enable efficient retrieval over high-dimensional neural embeddings, powering applications from web search to retrieval-augmented generation. However, classical theory predicts such tasks should suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where distances between points become nearly indistinguishable, thereby crippling efficient nearest-neighbor search. We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions. Across synthetic and real datasets, our experimental results match our theoretical predictions, offering concrete guidance for model and system design to avoid the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Learning with Structure: Computing Consistent Subsets on Structurally-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Consistent Subset (MCS) problem arises naturally in the context of supervised clustering and instance selection. In supervised clustering, one aims to infer a meaningful partitioning of data using a small labeled subset. However, the sheer volume of training data in modern applications poses a significant computational challenge. The MCS problem formalizes this goal: given a labeled dataset $\mathcal{X}$ in a metric space, the task is to compute a smallest subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ such that every point in $\mathcal{X}$ shares its label with at least one of its nearest neighbors in $S$.
  Recently, the MCS problem has been extended to graph metrics, where distances are defined by shortest paths. Prior work has shown that MCS remains NP-hard even on simple graph classes like trees, though an algorithm with runtime $\mathcal{O}(2^{6c} \cdot n^6)$ is known for trees, where $c$ is the number of colors and $n$ the number of vertices. This raises the challenge of identifying graph classes that admit algorithms efficient in both $n$ and $c$.
  In this work, we study the Minimum Consistent Subset problem on graphs, focusing on two well-established measures: the vertex cover number ($vc$) and the neighborhood diversity ($nd$). We develop an algorithm with running time $vc^{\mathcal{O}(vc)}\cdot\text{Poly}(n,c)$, and another algorithm with runtime $nd^{\mathcal{O}(nd)}\cdot\text{Poly}(n,c)$. In the language of parameterized complexity, this implies that MCS is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the vertex cover number and the neighborhood diversity. Notably, our algorithms remain efficient for arbitrarily many colors, as their complexity is polynomially dependent on the number of colors.</description>

      <title>Cycles Communities from the Perspective of Dendrograms and Gradient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and comparing topological features, particularly cycles, across different topological objects remains a fundamental challenge in persistent homology and topological data analysis. This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects.</description>

Abstract: We prove a colorful extension of a Helly-type theorem by Danzer and Gr\"{u}nbaum (Combinatorica, 1982) concerning two-piercing families of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show that our result is tight by constructing extremal families that achieve the bound. Related work includes a graph-theoretic proof of the original theorem by Pendavingh, Puite, and Woeginger (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2008), and a two-piercing result for lower-dimensional boxes by Ba\~{n}os and Oliveros (Acta Mathematica Hungarica, 2018).</description>

      <title>Computing Conforming Partitions with Low Stabbing Number for Rectilinear Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conforming partition of a rectilinear n-gon P (possibly with holes) is a partition of P into rectangles without using Steiner points (i.e., all corners of all rectangles must lie on the boundary of P). The stabbing number of such a partition is the maximum number of rectangles intersected by an axis-aligned segment lying in the interior of P. In this paper, we examine the problem of computing conforming partitions with low stabbing number. We show that computing a conforming partition with stabbing number at most 4 is NP-hard, which strengthens a previously known hardness result [Durocher \&amp; Mehrabi, Theor. Comput. Sci. 689: 157-168 (2017)] and eliminates the possibility for fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms parameterized by the stabbing number unless P = NP. In contrast, we give (i) an O(n log n)-time algorithm to decide whether a conforming partition with stabbing number 2 exists, (ii) a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm parameterized by both the stabbing number and treewidth of the pixel graph of the polygon, and (iii) a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm parameterized by the stabbing number for polygons without holes in general position.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Computation of Euler Characteristic Functions and Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications. However, current methods for computing these functions are either not optimized for speed or do not scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we present a vectorized framework for computing such topological descriptors using tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in full generality across simplicial and cubical complexes of arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant speedups over existing methods when computing the WECT and ECF across a variety of two- and three-dimensional datasets. Computation of these transforms is implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.</description>

      <title>OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all n great thank or equal to 3, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n = 3 (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to 4 (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>
