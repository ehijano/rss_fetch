      <title>Quality-Aware End-to-End Audio-Visual Neural Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quality-aware end-to-end audio-visual neural speaker diarization framework, which comprises three key techniques. First, our audio-visual model takes both audio and visual features as inputs, utilizing a series of binary classification output layers to simultaneously identify the activities of all speakers. This end-to-end framework is meticulously designed to effectively handle situations of overlapping speech, providing accurate discrimination between speech and non-speech segments through the utilization of multi-modal information. Next, we employ a quality-aware audio-visual fusion structure to address signal quality issues for both audio degradations, such as noise, reverberation and other distortions, and video degradations, such as occlusions, off-screen speakers, or unreliable detection. Finally, a cross attention mechanism applied to multi-speaker embedding empowers the network to handle scenarios with varying numbers of speakers. Our experimental results, obtained from various data sets, demonstrate the robustness of our proposed techniques in diverse acoustic environments. Even in scenarios with severely degraded video quality, our system attains performance levels comparable to the best available audio-visual systems.</description>

      <title>DOA-Aware Audio-Visual Self-Supervised Learning for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes sound event localization and detection (SELD) for spatial audio recordings captured by firstorder ambisonics (FOA) microphones. In this task, one may train a deep neural network (DNN) using FOA data annotated with the classes and directions of arrival (DOAs) of sound events. However, the performance of this approach is severely bounded by the amount of annotated data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method of pretraining the feature extraction part of the DNN in a self-supervised manner. We use spatial audio-visual recordings abundantly available as virtual reality contents. Assuming that sound objects are concurrently observed by the FOA microphones and the omni-directional camera, we jointly train audio and visual encoders with contrastive learning such that the audio and visual embeddings of the same recording and DOA are made close. A key feature of our method is that the DOA-wise audio embeddings are jointly extracted from the raw audio data, while the DOA-wise visual embeddings are separately extracted from the local visual crops centered on the corresponding DOA. This encourages the latent features of the audio encoder to represent both the classes and DOAs of sound events. The experiment using the DCASE2022 Task 3 dataset of 20 hours shows non-annotated audio-visual recordings of 100 hours reduced the error score of SELD from 36.4 pts to 34.9 pts.</description>

      <title>Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23230v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>MMBench-Video: A Long-Form Multi-Shot Benchmark for Holistic Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.</description>

      <title>Feature distribution Adaptation Network for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.</description>
