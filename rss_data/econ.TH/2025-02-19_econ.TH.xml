      <title>Multi-dimensional Test Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should one jointly design tests and the arrangement of agencies to administer these tests (testing procedure)? To answer this question, we analyze a model where a principal must use multiple tests to screen an agent with a multi-dimensional type, knowing that the agent can change his type at a cost. We identify a new tradeoff between setting difficult tests and using a difficult testing procedure. We compare two settings: (1) the agent only misrepresents his type (manipulation) and (2) the agent improves his actual type (investment). Examples include interviews, regulations, and data classification. We show that in the manipulation setting, stringent tests combined with an easy procedure, i.e., offering tests sequentially in a fixed order, is optimal. In contrast, in the investment setting, non-stringent tests with a difficult procedure, i.e., offering tests simultaneously, is optimal; however, under mild conditions offering them sequentially in a random order may be as good. Our results suggest that whether the agent manipulates or invests in his type determines which arrangement of agencies is optimal.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues in microeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Square matrices often arise in microeconomics, particularly in network models addressing applications from opinion dynamics to platform regulation. Spectral theory provides powerful tools for analyzing their properties. We present an accessible overview of several fundamental applications of spectral methods in microeconomics, focusing especially on the Perron-Frobenius Theorem's role and its connection to centrality measures. Applications include social learning, network games, public goods provision, and market intervention under uncertainty. The exposition assumes minimal social science background, using spectral theory as a unifying mathematical thread to introduce interested readers to some exciting current topics in microeconomic theory.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Instability in Strategy-Proof Matching Mechanism Using A Linear Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the design of matching mechanisms that are strategy-proof and simultaneously as stable as possible. Building on the impossibility result by \cite{Roth1982-cl} for one-to-one matching problems, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes stability under the constraint of strategy-proofness. In our model the objective is to minimize the degree of instability measured as the sum (or worst-case maximum) of stability violations over all preference profiles. We further introduce the socially important properties of anonymity and symmetry into the formulation.
  Our computational results show that, for small markets, our optimization approach leads to mechanisms with substantially lower stability violations than RSD. In particular, the optimal mechanism under our formulation exhibits roughly one-third the stability violation of RSD.
  For deterministic mechanisms in the three-agent case, we also find that any strategy-proof mechanism hvae at least two blocking pairs at the worst case, and we propose an algorithm that attains this lower bound. Finally, we discuss extensions to larger markets and present simulation evidence that our mechanism yields a reduction of approximately $0.25$ blocking pairs on average compared to SD mechanism.</description>

      <title>Collective Intelligence in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit DeGroot learning to examine the robustness of social learning outcomes in dynamic networks -- networks that evolve randomly over time. Randomness stems from multiple sources such as random matching and strategic network formation. Our main contribution is that random dynamics have double-edged effects depending on social structure: while they can foster consensus and boost collective intelligence, they can have adverse effects such as slowing down the speed of learning and causing long-term disagreement. Collective intelligence in dynamic networks requires balancing people's average influence with their average trust as society grows. We also find that the initial social structure of a dynamic network plays a central role in shaping long-term beliefs.</description>

      <title>Recurring Auctions with Costly Entry: Theory and Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurring auctions are ubiquitous for selling durable assets like artworks and homes, with follow-up auctions held for unsold items. We investigate such auctions theoretically and empirically. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that recurring auctions outperform single-round auctions when buyers face entry costs, enhancing efficiency and revenue due to sorted entry of potential buyers. Optimal reserve price sequences are characterized. Empirical findings from home foreclosure auctions in China reveal significant annual gains in efficiency (3.40 billion USD, 16.60%) and revenue (2.97 billion USD, 15.92%) using recurring auctions compared to single-round auctions. Implementing optimal reserve prices can further improve efficiency (3.35%) and revenue (3.06%).</description>

      <title>How to Make an Action Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09294v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two actions in a decision problem, a and b, each of which that produces a state-dependent monetary reward, we study how to robustly make action a more attractive. Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at which a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is preferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in money). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications in politics, bilateral trade, insurance, and information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a principal-agent model in which a principal hires an agent to collect information about an unknown continuous state. The agent acquires a signal whose distribution is centered around the state, controlling the signal's precision at a cost. The principal observes neither the precision nor the signal, but rather, using transfers that can depend on the state, incentivizes the agent to choose high precision and report the signal truthfully. I identify a sufficient and necessary condition on the agent's information structure which ensures that there exists an optimal transfer with a simple cutoff structure: the agent receives a fixed prize when his prediction is close enough to the state and receives nothing otherwise. This condition is mild and applies to all signal distributions commonly used in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a network-based method to capture heterogeneity in consumer microdata. We develop a permutation-based approach that repeatedly combines random samples of all agents' decisions, and partitions agents into jointly rational types. Aggregating these partitions yields a network that captures unobserved heterogeneity, where edges measure how often two agents share the same type across partitions. To evaluate how observable characteristics align with the heterogeneity, we implement permutation tests that shuffle covariate labels across network nodes, thereby generating a null distribution of alignment. We show that this test is exact, with asymptotic power of one. We further propose network-based measures that quantify whether nodes with the same observable attributes are disproportionately linked or clustered, along with standardized effect sizes that gauge each covariate's global influence. This yields a flexible, nonparametric measure of the heterogeneity structure. Finally, we apply our method to grocery expenditure data from the Stanford Basket Dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a sharp identification region for discrete choice models where consumers' preferences are not necessarily complete even if only aggregate choice data is available. Behavior is modeled using an upper and a lower utility for each alternative so that non-comparability can arise. The identification region places intuitive bounds on the probability distribution of upper and lower utilities. We show that the existence of an instrumental variable can be used to reject the hypothesis that the preferences of all consumers are complete. We apply our methods to data from the 2018 mid-term elections in Ohio.</description>

      <title>Self-Resolving Prediction Markets for Unverifiable Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction markets elicit and aggregate beliefs by paying agents based on how close their predictions are to a verifiable future outcome. However, outcomes of many important questions are difficult to verify or unverifiable, in that the ground truth may be hard or impossible to access. We present a novel incentive-compatible prediction market mechanism to elicit and efficiently aggregate information from a pool of agents without observing the outcome, by paying agents the negative cross-entropy between their prediction and that of a carefully chosen reference agent. Our key insight is that a reference agent with access to more information can serve as a reasonable proxy for the ground truth. We use this insight to propose self-resolving prediction markets that terminate with some probability after every report and pay all but a few agents based on the final prediction. The final agent is chosen as the reference agent since they observe the full history of market forecasts, and thus have more information by design. We show that it is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) for all agents to report truthfully in our mechanism and to believe that all other agents report truthfully. Although primarily of interest for unverifiable outcomes, this design is also applicable for verifiable outcomes.</description>

      <title>The reference interval in higher-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>

      <title>Tractable General Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>
