      <title>QxEAI -- Automated probabilistic forecasting with Quantum-like evolutionary algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting, to estimate future events, is crucial for business and decision-making. This paper proposes QxEAI, a methodology that produces a probabilistic forecast that utilizes a quantum-like evolutionary algorithm based on training a quantum-like logic decision tree and a classical value tree on a small number of related time series. By using different cycles of the Dow Jones Index (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily), we demonstrate how our methodology produces accurate forecasts while requiring little to none manual work.</description>

      <title>The big bang of an epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework that governs the evolution of epidemic dynamics, encompassing both intra-population dynamics and inter-population mobility within a metapopulation network. By linearizing this dynamical system, we can identify the spatial starting point(s), namely the source(s) (A) and the initiation time (B) of any epidemic, which we refer to as the "Big Bang" of the epidemic. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept of effective distance to track disease spread within the network. Our analysis reveals that the contagion geometry can be represented as a line with a universal slope, independent of disease type (R0) or mobility network configuration. The mathematical derivations presented in this framework are corroborated by empirical data, including observations from the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran and the US, as well as the H1N1 outbreak worldwide. Within this framework, in order to detect the Big Bang of an epidemic we require two types of data: A) A snapshot of the active infected cases in each subpopulation during the linear phase. B) A coarse-grained representation of inter-population mobility. Also even with access to only type A data, we can still demonstrate the universal contagion geometric pattern. Additionally, we can estimate errors and assess the precision of the estimations. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of when and where epidemics began and how they spread, and equips us with valuable insights for developing effective public health policies and mitigating the impact of infectious diseases on populations worldwide.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity in Mono-Partite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initially designed to predict and explain the economic trajectories of countries, cities, and regions, economic complexity has been found applicable in diverse contexts such as ecology and chess openings. The success of economic complexity stems from its capacity to assess hidden capabilities within a system indirectly. The existing algorithms for economic complexity operate only when the underlying interaction topology conforms to a bipartite graph. A single link disrupting the bipartite structure renders these algorithms inapplicable, even if the weight of that link is tiny compared to others. This paper presents a novel extension of economic complexity to encompass any graph, overcoming the constraints of bipartite structures. Additionally, it introduces fitness centrality and orthofitness centrality as new centrality measures in graphs. Fitness Centrality emerges as a promising metric for assessing node vulnerability, akin to node betweenness centrality. Furthermore, we unveil the cost functions that drive the minimization procedures underlying the economic complexity index and fitness centrality algorithms. This extension broadens the scope of economic complexity analysis, enabling its application in diverse network structures beyond bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Competition between self- and other-regarding preferences in resolving social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory assumes that individuals maximize their benefits when choosing strategies. However, an alternative perspective proposes that individuals seek to maximize the benefits of others. To explore the relationship between these perspectives, we develop a model where self- and other-regarding preferences compete in public goods games. We find that other-regarding preferences are more effective in promoting cooperation, even when self-regarding preferences are more productive. Cooperators with different preferences can coexist in a new phase where two classic solutions invade each other, resulting in a dynamical equilibrium. As a consequence, a lower productivity of self-regarding cooperation can provide a higher cooperation level. Our results, which are also valid in a well-mixed population, may explain why other-regarding preferences could be a viable and frequently observed attitude in human society.</description>

      <title>Exact Cluster Dynamics of Indirect Reciprocity in Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heider's balance theory emphasizes cognitive consistency in assessing others, as is expressed by ``The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'' At the same time, the theory of indirect reciprocity provides us with a dynamical framework to study how to assess others based on their actions as well as how to act toward them based on the assessments. Well-known are the `leading eight' from L1 to L8, the eight norms for assessment and action to foster cooperation in social dilemmas while resisting the invasion of mutant norms prescribing alternative actions. In this work, we begin by showing that balance is equivalent to stationarity of dynamics only for L4 and L6 (Stern Judging) among the leading eight. Stern Judging reflects an intuitive idea that good merits reward whereas evil warrants punishment. By analyzing the dynamics of Stern Judging in complete graphs, we prove that this norm almost always segregates the graph into two mutually hostile groups as the graph size grows. We then compare L4 with Stern Judging: The only difference of L4 is that a good player's cooperative action toward a bad one is regarded as good. This subtle difference transforms large populations governed by L4 to a ``paradise'' where cooperation prevails and positive assessments abound. Our study thus helps us understand the relationship between individual norms and their emergent consequences at a population level, shedding light on the nuanced interplay between cognitive consistency and segregation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Link Me Baby One More Time: Social Music Discovery on Spotify</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular amongst the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the interplay between music discovery and social processes.</description>

      <title>No-exclaves percolation on random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No-exclaves percolation (NExP) is a nonlocal percolation process in which the components are formed not only by the connected occupied nodes but also by the agglomeration of empty nodes completely surrounded by the occupied nodes. It has been studied in low dimensions, displaying such novel phenomena as the discontinuous transition to complete percolation. However, its characteristics in complex networks are still unexplored. In this paper, we study the NExP on random networks by developing mean-field solutions using the generating function formalism. Our theory allows us to determine the size of the giant no-exclaves component as well as the percolation threshold, which are in excellent agreements with Monte Carlo simulations on random networks and some real-world networks. We show that on random networks NExP exhibits three phases and two transitions between them: the phases are characterized by the presence or absence of not only the giant NExP component but also the giant unoccupied component, which is the giant connected component composed solely of unoccupied nodes. This work offers theoretical understanding on the anatomy of phase transitions in the NExP process.</description>
