      <title>Homological dimensions, the Gorenstein property, and special cases of some conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose in this work is multifold. First, we provide general criteria for the finiteness of the projective and injective dimensions of a finite module $M$ over a (commutative) Noetherian ring $R$. Second, in the other direction, we investigate the impact of the finiteness of certain homological dimensions of $M$ if $R$ is local, mainly when $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay and with a partial focus on duals. Along the way, we produce various freeness criteria for modules. Finally, we give applications, including characterizations of when $R$ is Gorenstein (and other ring-theoretic properties as well, sometimes in the prime characteristic setting), particularly by means of its anticanonical module, and in addition we address special cases of some long-standing conjectures; for instance, we confirm the 1985 conjecture of Vasconcelos on normal modules in case the module of differentials is almost Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Intersection Theorem for DG-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be a commutative noetherian local DG-ring with bounded cohomology. The Intersection Theorem for DG-modules is examined and some of its applications are provided. The first is to prove the DG-setting of the amplitude inequality, New Intersection Theorem and Krull's principle ideal theorem. The second is to solve completely the Minamoto's conjecture in [Israel J. Math. 242 (2021) 1-36]. The third is to show the DG-version of the Bass conjecture about Cohen-Macaulay rings and the Vasconcelos conjecture about Gorenstein rings.</description>

      <title>A Class of Numerical Semigroups Defined by Kunz and Waldo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a class of numerical semigroups initiated by Kunz and Waldi containing two coprime numbers $p &lt; q$, which we call KW semigroups. We characterize KW numerical semigroups by their principal matrices. We present a necessary and sufficient criterion for a matrix to be the principal matrix of a KW semigroup. An explicit description of the minimal resolutions of numerical semigroups in the same class with small embedding dimensions 3 and 4 is given. We give a generalization of this notion to three dimensions using lattice paths under a plane and present some preliminary results and questions.</description>

      <title>The Nucleus of a Compact Lie Group, and Support of Singularity Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we adapt the notion of the nucleus defined by Benson, Carlson, and Robinson to compact Lie groups in non-modular characteristic. We show that it describes the singularities of the projective scheme of the cohomology of its classifying space. A notion of support for singularity categories of ring spectra (in the sense of Greenlees and Stevenson) is established, and is shown to be precisely the nucleus in this case, consistent with a conjecture of Benson and Greenlees for finite groups.</description>

      <title>When every finitely generated ideal is S-principal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of $S$-B\'ezout ring, as a generalization of B\'ezout ring. We investigate the relationships between $S$-B\'ezout and other related classes of rings. We establish some characterizations of $S$-B\'ezout rings. We study this property in various contexts of commutative rings including direct product, localization, trivial ring extensions and amalgamation rings. Our results allow us to construct new original classes of $S$-B\'ezout rings subject to various ring theoretical properties. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of nonnil $S$-B\'ezout ring and establish some characterizations.</description>

      <title>The Skolem property in rings of integer-valued rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\Int}{Int} \DeclareMathOperator{\IntR}{Int{}^\text{R}} \newcommand{\Z}{{\mathbb Z}}$Let $D$ be a domain and let $\Int(D)$ and $\IntR(D)$ be the ring of integer-valued polynomials and the ring of integer-valued rational functions, respectively. Skolem proved that if $I$ is a finitely-generated ideal of $\Int(\Z)$ with all the value ideals of $I$ not being proper, then $I = \Int(\Z)$. This is known as the Skolem property, which does not hold in $\Z[x]$. One obstruction to $\Int(D)$ having the Skolem property is the existence of unit-valued polynomials. This is no longer an obstruction when we consider the Skolem property on $\IntR(D)$. We determine that the Skolem property on $\IntR(D)$ is equivalent to the maximal spectrum being contained in the ultrafilter closure of the set of maximal pointed ideals. We generalize the Skolem property using star operations and determine an analogous equivalence under this generalized notion.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued rational functions over globalized pseudovaluation domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\IntR}{Int{}^\text{R}}$$\DeclareMathOperator{\Int}{Int}$Let $D$ be a domain. Park determined the necessary and sufficient conditions for which the ring of integer-valued polynomials $\Int(D)$ is a globalized pseudovaluation domain (GPVD). In this work, we investigate the ring of integer-valued rational functions $\IntR(D)$. Since it is necessary that $D$ be a GPVD for $\IntR(D)$ to be a GPVD, we consider $\IntR(D)$, where $D$ is a GPVD. We determine that if $D$ is a pseudosingular GPVD, then $\IntR(D)$ is a GPVD. We also completely characterize when $\IntR(D)$ is a GPVD if $D$ is a pseudovaluation domain that is not a valuation domain.</description>

      <title>The small finitistic dimensions of commutative rings, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small finitistic dimension $\fPD(R)$ of a ring $R$ is defined to be the supremum of projective dimensions of $R$-modules with finite projective resolutions. In this paper, we investigate the small finitistic dimensions of four types of ring constructions: polynomial rings, formal power series rings, trivial extensions and amalgamations. Besides, we show the small finitistic dimensions of a ring is less than or equal to its Krull dimension. We also give a total ring of quotients with infinite small finitistic dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short, new proof of a recent result of Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev about toric varieties. As in their work, this leads to a proof of a conjecture of Berkesch-Erman-Smith on virtual resolutions and to a resolution of the diagonal in the simplicial case.</description>
