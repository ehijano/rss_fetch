      <title>Passive Time-Varying Waveform-Selective Metasurfaces for Attainment of Magnetic Property Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present circuit-loaded metasurfaces that behave differently in a passive manner even at the same frequency in accordance with the incoming waveform, specifically, its pulse width. Importantly, the time-varying waveform-selective metasurfaces reported thus far were mostly able to change their electric properties but not their magnetic properties; this severely limited the design range of their corresponding wave impedances and refractive indices and thus hindered the development of potential applications in antennas, sensors, imagers, signal processing, and wireless communications. In this study, passive time-varying waveform-selective metasurfaces were found to attain magnetic property control by introducing an additional circuit-loaded layer that generated an artificial magnetic dipole moment; this magnetic moment only occurred during the designed pulse duration in the time domain. Our proposed concept and structures were validated numerically and experimentally; thus, our results could be used to address electromagnetic and related issues sharing the same frequency component via the variation of the pulse width as an additional degree of freedom.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a perspective approach for simulating a memristive sensor tailored for low power biological analyte detection. The necessity for such innovation stems from the increasing demand for efficient biosensing technologies that can operate with minimal poxer consumption. Within this study, a numerical dynamic memristive model serves as a basis platform for implementing enhanced nanosensing method characterized by low cost and high sensitivity. Numerous simulations were conducted to validate the suitability of the dynamic memristive model's behaviour for emulating a chemical sensing approach. The simulated data is collected for deploying an AI application to ensure an advanced predictable biosensing intake function. All in all, this work paves the way for developing compact numerical models of memristive biosensors, addressing the pressing need for portable lox poxer consumption biosensing solutions.</description>

      <title>Physical Neural Networks with Self-Learning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical neural networks are artificial neural networks that mimic synapses and neurons using physical systems or materials. These networks harness the distinctive characteristics of physical systems to carry out computations effectively, potentially surpassing the constraints of conventional digital neural networks. A recent advancement known as ``physical self-learning'' aims to achieve learning through intrinsic physical processes rather than relying on external computations. This article offers a comprehensive review of the progress made in implementing physical self-learning across various physical systems. Prevailing learning strategies are discussed that contribute to the realization of physical self-learning. Despite challenges in understanding fundamental mechanism of learning, this work highlights the progress towards constructing intelligent hardware from the ground up, incorporating embedded self-organizing and self-adaptive dynamics in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Ideal Gas Law in the Air-bearing of Hard Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report evaluates the applicability of the ideal gas law in the pressurized air-bearing of hard disk drives when calculating the relative humidity. We employ a semi-analytical numerical method that solves vapor-liquid equilibrium using the Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equation of state to calculate the saturation pressure of water. The deviation from the ideal gas law is quantified and examined through saturation pressure isotherms. We find that at low temperatures, lighter gases such as helium show little deviation from the ideal gas law, whereas heavier gases such as nitrogen deviate significantly. As temperature increases, the difference between the gases decreases. The results suggest that in areas of low temperature, the non-ideal nature of gases must be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Enhancement in neuromorphic NbO2 memristive device switching at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical properties and performance characteristics of niobium dioxide (NbO$_\mathrm{2}$)-based memristive devices are examined at cryogenic temperatures. Sub-stoichiometric Nb$_\mathrm{2}$O$_\mathrm{5}$ was deposited via magnetron sputtering and patterned in microscale (2$\times$2 - 15$\times$15 $\mu$m$^2$) cross-bar Au/Ru/NbO$_\mathrm{x}$/Pt devices and electroformed at 3-5 V to make NbO$_\mathrm{2}$ filaments. At cryogenic temperatures, the threshold voltage ($V_\mathrm{th}$) increased by more than a factor of 3. The hold voltage ($V_\mathrm{h}$) was significantly lower than the threshold voltage for fast voltage sweeps (200 ms per measurement). If the sample is allowed to cool between voltage measurements, the hold voltage increases, but never reaches the threshold voltage, indicating the presence of non-volatile Nb$_\mathrm{2}$O$_\mathrm{5}$ in the filament. The devices have an activation energy of $E_a \approx 1.4$ eV, lower than other NbO$_\mathrm{2}$ devices reported. Our works shows that even nominally ``bad" memristive devices can be improved by reducing the leakage current and increases the sample resistance at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Pulse excitation mode selection via AI Pipeline to Fully Automate the WUCT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametric optimization for the ultrasound computed tomography system is introduced. It is hypothesized that the pulse characteristic directly affects the information present in the reconstructed profile. The ultrasound excitation modes based on pulse-width modifications are studied to estimate the effect on reconstruction quality. Studies show that the pulse width affects the response of the transducer and, thus, the reconstruction. The ultrasound scanning parameters, mainly pulse width, are assessed and optimally set by an Artificial Intelligence driven process, according to the object without the requirement of a-priori information. The optimization study uses a novel intelligent object placement procedure to ensure repeatability of the same region of interest, a key requirement to minimize the error. Further, Kanpur Theorem 1 is implemented to evaluate the quality of the acquired projection data and discard inferior quality data. Scanning results corresponding to homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The image processing step involves deep learning model evaluating the dice coefficient for estimating the reconstruction quality if prior information about the inner profile is known or a classical error estimate otherwise. The models segmentation accuracy is 95.72 percentage and intersection over union score is 0.8842 on the validation dataset. The article also provides valuable insights about the development and low-level control of the system.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional imaging with partially coherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional imagers form images of input objects only in one direction, e.g., from field-of-view (FOV) A to FOV B, while blocking the image formation in the reverse direction, from FOV B to FOV A. Here, we report unidirectional imaging under spatially partially coherent light and demonstrate high-quality imaging only in the forward direction (A-&gt;B) with high power efficiency while distorting the image formation in the backward direction (B-&gt;A) along with low power efficiency. Our reciprocal design features a set of spatially engineered linear diffractive layers that are statistically optimized for partially coherent illumination with a given phase correlation length. Our analyses reveal that when illuminated by a partially coherent beam with a correlation length of ~1.5 w or larger, where w is the wavelength of light, diffractive unidirectional imagers achieve robust performance, exhibiting asymmetric imaging performance between the forward and backward directions - as desired. A partially coherent unidirectional imager designed with a smaller correlation length of less than 1.5 w still supports unidirectional image transmission, but with a reduced figure of merit. These partially coherent diffractive unidirectional imagers are compact (axially spanning less than 75 w), polarization-independent, and compatible with various types of illumination sources, making them well-suited for applications in asymmetric visual information processing and communication.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of CO2 Conversion to SAF in a Fixed Bed Catalytic Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon refers to an indirect pathway of CO2 utilization. Among them, the conversion of CO2 with green H2 to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with high energy density has gained much attention. It offers a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the fossil fuel crises, and transform a climate killer into valuable products. However, this low-carbon technology is intrinsically complicated. It involves the development of a catalyst, the design of a reaction system, and its operation and product refining. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical process of CO2 hydrogenation in the reactor. In this study, numerical simulations of a fixed bed catalytic reactor for CO2-to-SAF conversion are conducted by coupling CFD with heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the catalytic surface. The heat and mass transfer between the catalyst surface and surrounding fluid flow are resolved in the simulation. A detailed understanding of the reacting flow and catalytic processes is obtained from this study. The impact of operating parameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, and the ratio between CO2 and H2, is also explored, which provides important insights into the catalytic reactor design and operation.</description>

      <title>Development and Characterization of a Novel BaTiO3-Based Material for Medium Temperature Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) materials are extensively utilized in self-regulating temperature applications. Nonetheless, their applicability is typically constrained to low-temperature ranges, rendering them ineffective in medium temperature environments. This study presents a methodology for the fabrication of an innovative PTC material operational at approximately 353~{\deg}C, with a thorough investigation of its Curie temperature and resistivity properties. The material formulation incorporates 4~wt\% carbon black (CB), 0.5~wt\% NBT, and 5~wt\% DOP into a BaTiO$_3$-based matrix. The empirical findings reveal that this material exhibits a notably high PTC strength of 5.8 and a comparatively low resistivity of 590~$\Omega\cdot$cm at room temperature. Furthermore, the material demonstrated excellent repeatability in PTC strength after thirty cycles of heating and cooling near the Curie temperature. Consequently, this PTC material is deemed highly effective for applications in cold environments, notably for the preheating and initiation of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units (APUs).</description>

      <title>AC thermal conductivity as a tool for solution mapping from diffusive to ballistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has been exploited to investigate non-diffusive phonon transport for decades, due to the challenges of solving this integro-differential equation, most standard techniques for thermal measurements still rely on solutions to the diffusion equation, causing inconsistency between measured non-diffusive effects and the diffusion equation based techniques. With the AC thermal conductivity, an analogous concept of the AC electrical conductivity in solid state physics, we transform BTE under the relaxation time approximation into the form of the diffusion equation. This transformation maps any analytical solution of the diffusion equation under periodic heating to that of the BTE, with the nonlocal effect captured by the jump boundary condition. After investigating the validity of this framework, we apply it to generalize the 3{\omega} method from diffusive to quasi-ballistic, and propose an experimental scheme to address the inconsistency problem above.</description>

      <title>In-situ Patterned Damage-Free Etching of 3-Dimensional Structures in \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using Triethylgallium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the anisotropic etching characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using triethylgallium (TEGa) performed in-situ within an MOCVD chamber. At sufficiently high substrate temperature, TEGa can act as a strong etchant for \b{eta}-Ga2O3 utilizing the suboxide reaction between Ga and Ga2O3. We observe that due to monoclinic crystal structure of \b{eta}-Ga2O3, TEGa etching on both (010) and (001) substrates is highly anisotropic in nature, both in terms of sidewall roughness and lateral etch rate. Smooth sidewalls are only obtained along crystal orientations that minimize sidewall surface energy. Utilizing this technique we also demonstrate deep sub-micron fins with smooth sidewalls and high aspect ratios. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the damage free nature of TEGa etching by fabricating Schottky diodes on the etched surface which display no change in net donor concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of nanoscale matter has the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields across nanoscience and technology. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and characterize numerically a device that combines the benefits of dielectrophoresis (DEP) - long-range and strong trapping forces - with those of plasmonic tweezers - high sensitivities - to achieve a remarkable efficiency in the trapping and sensing of metallic nanoparticles and biomolecules. In particular, we show the DEP trapping and surface enhanced Raman scattering characterization of bovine serum albumin and Rhodamine B, thus extending the applications of tweezing devices to molecules having masses of only a few hundreds of Da. This range covers virtually any molecule relevant for life, from tiny oligopeptides to large proteins. This pushes our manipulation capabilities deep into the realms of efficient single-molecule biosensing and quantum science, providing a powerful platform to probe matter at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic microring resonators are used in a variety of chip-integrated sensing applications where they allow to measure transmission intensity changes upon external signals with a sensitivity that scales linearly with the Q-factor. In this work, we suggest to exploit the nonlinear self-phase-modulation effect to increase the overall sensitivity by an additional gain factor appearing when the operational point of the nonlinear resonator is chosen just at the cross-over from the mono- to the bistable regime. We present the theoretical idea together with a first proof of concept experiment displaying a gain factor of 22 on a chip-integrated silicon-nitride resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a concept of morphing structure -- featuring an arch mounted on a compliant base -- that can be reconfigured via snap-through buckling and leverages bistability to retain its morphed shape. We show that one-dimensional arrays of such units yield beam-like structures that, upon localized snapping, can attain multiple, morphologically distinct stable shapes. Units are modeled using discrete elastic rods, a reduced-order formulation for beams and beam structures, and the results are validated via experiments. We leverage our model to understand the influence of the geometrical design parameters on the response and final shape of a unit. We then show that the morphed shapes of arrays of units can be predicted by concatenating results of simulations on single units, and leverage this idea to inverse-design structures that can be snapped into target stable shapes. Ultimately, our work suggests an up-scalable way to create shape-retaining morphing structures with target stable shapes.</description>

Abstract: The dielectric properties of environmental surfaces, including walls, floors and the ground, etc., play a crucial role in shaping the accuracy of terahertz (THz) channel modeling, thereby directly impacting the effectiveness of communication systems. Traditionally, acquiring these properties has relied on methods such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or vector network analyzers (VNA), demanding rigorous sample preparation and entailing a significant expenditure of time. However, such measurements are not always feasible, particularly in novel and uncharacterized scenarios. In this work, we propose a new approach for channel modeling that leverages the inherent sensing capabilities of THz channels. By comparing the results obtained through channel sensing with that derived from THz-TDS measurements, we demonstrate the method's ability to yield dependable surface property information. The application of this approach in both a miniaturized cityscape scenario and an indoor environment has shown consistency with experimental measurements, thereby verifying its effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Bistable Organic Electrochemical Transistors: Enthalpy vs. Entropy</title>

Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) underpin a range of emerging technologies, from bioelectronics to neuromorphic computing, owing to their unique coupling of electronic and ionic charge carriers. In this context, various OECT systems exhibit significant hysteresis in their transfer curve, which is frequently leveraged to achieve non-volatility. Meanwhile, a general understanding of its physical origin is missing. Here, we introduce a thermodynamic framework that readily explains the emergence of bistable OECT operation via the interplay of enthalpy and entropy. We validate this model through temperature-resolved characterizations, material manipulation, and thermal imaging. Further, we reveal deviations from Boltzmann statistics for the subthreshold swing and reinterpret existing literature. Capitalizing on these findings, we finally demonstrate a single-OECT Schmitt trigger, thus compacting a multi-component circuit into a single device. These insights provide a fundamental advance for OECT physics and its application in non-conventional computing, where symmetry-breaking phenomena are pivotal to unlock new paradigms of information processing.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered around 13 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cage Evolution in Quasi-two-dimensional Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally explore the morphological evolution of cages in quasi-two-dimensional suspensions of colloidal fluids, uncovering a complex dynamic restructuring in the fluid. Although cages display isotropic evolution in the laboratory frame, we observe a striking anisotropy when analyzed in the displacement frame of the caged particles. Moreover, our findings reveal that particles in specific but distinct regions of the cage predominantly contribute to either its persistence or relaxation. Thus, our study provides a coarse-grained microscopic picture of the structural relaxation of these fluids through cage evolution, which has broader implications for the flow and phase behavior of complex fluids in confined geometry.</description>
