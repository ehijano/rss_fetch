      <title>Predicting root numbers with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on two machine learning experiments in search of statistical relationships between Dirichlet coefficients and root numbers or analytic ranks of certain low-degree $L$-functions. The first experiment is to construct interpretable models based on murmurations, a recently discovered correlation between Dirichlet coefficients and root numbers. We show experimentally that these models achieve high accuracy by learning a combination of Mestre-Nagao type heuristics and murmurations, noting that the relative importance of these features varies with degree. The second experiment is to search for a low-complexity statistic of Dirichlet coefficients that can be used to predict root numbers in polynomial time. We give experimental evidence and provide heuristics that suggest this can not be done with standard machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Jacobsthal Spinor Sequences and Their Mathematical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, novel Hyperbolic spinor sequences of Jacobsthal, Jacobsthal-Lucas and Jacobsthal polynomial, which have not been studied before, are defined by investigating the relationship between spinors, which are important mathematical objects used in physics and mathematics, and split Jacobsthal and split Jacobsthal-Lucas quaternions, which are extensions of the known Jacobsthal and Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers to quaternion algebra. The recurrence relations of sequences whose members are Hyperbolic Jacobsthal, Jacobsthal-Lucas and Jacobsthal polynomial spinors are described. Additionally, certain properties of these spinors, such as the generator function and Binet formula, are presented and some identities resulting from these spinors are obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the asymptotic solutions of the generalized Fermat-type equation of signature $(p,p,3)$ over totally real number fields $K$, i.e., $Ax^p+By^p=Cz^3$ with prime exponent $p$ and $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$. For certain class of fields $K$, we prove that $Ax^p+By^p=Cz^3$ has no asymptotic solutions over $K$ (resp., solutions of certain type over $K$) with restrictions on $A,B,C$ (resp., for all $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$). Finally, we present several local criteria over $K$.</description>

      <title>Counting numbers that are divisible by the product of their digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b \geq 3$ be a positive integer. A natural number is said to be a base-$b$ Zuckerman number if it is divisible by the product of its base-$b$ digits. Let $\mathcal{Z}_b(x)$ be the set of base-$b$ Zuckerman numbers that do not exceed $x$, and assume that $x \to +\infty$. First, we prove an upper bound of the form $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)| &lt; x^{z_b^{+} + o(1)}$, where $z_b^{+} \in (0,1)$ is an effectively computable constant. In particular, we have that $z_{10}^+ = 0.665{\scriptstyle\ldots}$, which improves upon the previous upper bound $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &lt; x^{0.717}$ due to Sanna. Moreover, we prove that $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &gt; x^{0.204}$, which improves upon the previous lower bound $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &gt; x^{0.122}$, due to De Koninck and Luca. Second, we provide a heuristic suggesting that $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)| = x^{z_b + o(1)}$, where $z_b \in (0,1)$ is an effectively computable constant. In particular, we have that $z_{10} = 0.419{\scriptstyle\ldots}$. Third, we provide algorithms to count, respectively enumerate, the elements of $\mathcal{Z}_b(x)$, and we determine their complexities. Implementing one of such counting algorithms, we computed $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)|$ for $b=3,\dots,12$ and large values of $x$ (depending on $b$), and we showed that the results are consistent with our heuristic.</description>

      <title>Distribution of cycles in supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Arpin, Chen, Lauter, Scheidler, Stange, and Tran counted the number of cycles of length $r$ in supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs. In this paper, we extend this work to count the number of cycles that occur along the spine. We provide formulas for both the number of such cycles, and the average number as $p \to \infty$, with $\ell$ and $r$ fixed. In particular, we show that when $r$ is not a power of $2$, cycles of length $r$ are disproportionately likely to occur along the spine. We provide experimental evidence that this result holds in the case that $r$ is a power of $2$ as well.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a double-folded operator that, upon iterative application, generates a dynamical system with two types of trajectories: a cyclic one and, another that grows endlessly on parabolas. These trajectories produce two distinct partitions of the set of lattice points in the plane.
  Our object is to analyze these trajectories and to point out a few special arithmetic properties of the integers they represent.
  We also introduce and study the parabolic-taxicab distance, which measures the fast traveling on the steps of the stairs defined by points on the parabolic trajectories whose coordinates are based on triangular numbers.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for integral points on modular curves using Runge's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a modular curve $X_G$ defined over a number field $K$, where $G$ is a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ with $N&gt;2$. The curve $X_G$ comes with a morphism $j: X_G\to \mathbb{P}^1_K=\mathbb{A}^1_K \cup\{\infty\}$ to the $j$-line. For a finite set of places $S$ of $K$ that satisfies a certain condition, Runge's method shows that there are only finitely many points $P \in X_G(K)$ for which $j(P)$ lies in the ring $\mathfrak{O}_{K,S}$ of $S$-units of $K$. We prove an explicit version which shows that if $j(P)\in \mathfrak{O}_{K,S}$ for some $P\in X_G(K)$, then the absolute logarithmic height of $j(P)$ is bounded above by $N^{12} \log N$. Explicits upper bounds have already been obtained by Bilu and Parent though they are not polynomial in $N$. The modular functions needed to apply Runge's method are constructing using Eisenstein series of weight $1$.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular forms from zeta generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-holomorphic modular forms built from iterated integrals of holomorphic modular forms for SL$(2,\mathbb Z)$ known as equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. A special subclass of them furnishes an equivalent description of the modular graph forms appearing in the low-energy expansion of string amplitudes at genus one. Notably the Fourier expansion of modular graph forms contains single-valued multiple zeta values. We deduce the appearance of products and higher-depth instances of multiple zeta values in equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals, and ultimately modular graph forms, from the appearance of simpler odd Riemann zeta values. This analysis relies on so-called zeta generators which act on certain non-commutative variables in the generating series of the iterated integrals. From an extension of these non-commutative variables we incorporate iterated integrals involving holomorphic cusp forms into our setup and use them to construct the modular completion of triple Eisenstein integrals. Our work represents a fully explicit realisation of the modular graph forms within Brown's framework of equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals and reveals structural analogies between single-valued period functions appearing in genus zero and one string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>BCZ map is weakly mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BCZ map was introduced in 2001 by Boca, Cobeli and Zaharescu as a tool to study the statistical properties of Farey sequences, whose relation to Riemann Hypothesis dates back to Franel and Landau. Later, J. Athreya and the first author observed that the BCZ map arises as a Poincare section of horocycle flow, establishing both ergodicity as well as zero measure-theoretic entropy. In this article, we prove that the BCZ map is weakly mixing, answering the last remaining question about the BCZ map raised in a 2006 survey by Boca and Zaharescu. The proof uses a self-similarity property of the BCZ map that derives from a well-known fact that horocycle flow is renormalized by the geodesic flow, a property already observed in arXiv:1206.6597. We note that the questions of mixing and rigidity remain open.</description>

      <title>Explicit open images for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a non-CM elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois action on its torsion points gives rise to a Galois representation $\rho_E: Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})\to GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ that is unique up to isomorphism. A renowned theorem of Serre says that the image of $\rho_E$ is an open, and hence finite index, subgroup of $GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$. We describe an algorithm that computes the image of $\rho_E$ up to conjugacy in $GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$; this algorithm is practical and has been implemented. Up to a positive answer to a uniformity question of Serre and finding all the rational points on a finite number of explicit modular curves of genus at least $2$, we give a complete classification of the groups $\rho_E(Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}))\cap SL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})$ and the indices $[GL_2(\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}):\rho_E(Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}))]$ for non-CM elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$. Much of the paper is dedicated to the efficient computation of modular curves via modular forms expressed in terms of Eisenstein series.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a question asked on the list {\tt mathfun}, we revisit {\em Kempner-like series}, i.e., harmonic sums $\sum' 1/n$ where the integers $n$ in the summation have ``restricted'' digits. First we give a short proof that $\lim_{k \to \infty}(\sum_{s_2(n) = k} 1/n) = 2 \log 2$, where $s_2(n)$ is the sum of the binary digits of the integer $n$. Then we propose two generalizations. One generalization addresses the case where $s_2(n)$ is replaced with $s_b(n)$, the sum of $b$-ary digits in base $b$: we prove that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\sum_{s_b(n) = k} 1/n = (2 \log b)/(b-1)$. The second generalization replaces the sum of digits in base $2$ with any block-counting function in base $2$, e.g., the function $a(n)$ of -- possibly overlapping -- $11$'s in the base-$2$ expansion of $n$, for which we obtain $\lim_{k \to \infty}\sum_{a(n) = k} 1/n = 4 \log 2$.</description>

      <title>Integral structures in smooth $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-representations and zeta integrals</title>

Abstract: For an odd prime $p$ and an unramified maximal torus $H $ of $\mathrm{GL}_{2/\mathbf{Q}_p}$, inspired by work of Loeffler-Skinner-Zerbes, we construct natural $H(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-stable lattices in spaces of functions on $\left(\mathrm{GL}_2\times H\right)(\mathbf{Q}_p)$. These local lattices give rise to canonical Hecke operators in local spherical Hecke algebras, that enjoy certain integrality properties away from $p$, with respect to equivariant maps into any smooth $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-representation. As a global application, we obtain integral $\ell$-adic Hecke operators in global Hecke algebras, and certain integrality results on automorphic representations attached to cuspidal Hecke eigenforms.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Diophantine equation $x^2 + p^k=y^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to find all solutions of the Diophantine equation $x^2 + p^k=y^n$ where $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, $\frac{p-1}{3}$ is a perfect square and the class number of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-p}]$ is $2$. In this article, I used a method involving prime factorization and class numbers which is different from using congruent number argument which is widely used in this type of problem.</description>

      <title>Cohomological flatness over discrete valuation rings: numerical and logarithmic criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give sufficient conditions for cohomological flatness (in dimension 0) over discrete valuation rings, generalising a classical result of Raynaud in two different ways. The first is an extension of Raynaud's numerical criterion to higher dimensions. The second is a logarithmic criterion: we show that a proper, fs log smooth morphism to a log regular discrete valuation ring is cohomologically flat in dimension 0. We apply this latter result to curves and torsors under abelian varieties with good reduction, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the log smoothness of their regular models over arbitrary discrete valuation rings.</description>
