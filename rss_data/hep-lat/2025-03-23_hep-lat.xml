      <title>A Julia Code for Lattice QCD on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new GPU-based open source package to perform Lattice simulations developed in Julia. The code currently supports generation of SU(2) and SU(3) (pure gauge) configurations with different actions and boundary conditions, and is able to perform measurements of flow observables (both gluonic and fermionic) as well as different fermionic two point functions. We will show the capabilities of the package, and provide information about some measurement codes built on top of this framework.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of bottomonium at high temperature: a systematic investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spectral features of bottomonium at high temperature, in particular the thermal mass shift and width of ground state S-wave and P-wave state. We employ and compare a range of methods for determining these features from lattice NRQCD correlators, including direct correlator analyses (multi-exponential fits and moments of spectral functions), linear methods (Backus-Gilbert, Tikhonov and HLT methods), and Bayesian methods for spectral function reconstruction (MEM and BR). We comment on the reliability and limitations of the various methods.</description>

      <title>Filtered Rayleigh-Ritz is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the (block) Lanczos algorithm can be used to extract approximate energy spectra and matrix elements from (matrices of) correlation functions in quantum field theory, and identified exact coincidences between Lanczos analysis methods and others. In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger "Prony-Ritz equivalence class", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.</description>

      <title>Efficient use of quantum computers for collider physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most observables at particle colliders involve physics at a wide variety of distance scales. Due to asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction, the physics at short distances can be calculated reliably using perturbative techniques, while long distance physics is non-perturbative in nature. Factorization theorems separate the contributions from different scales scales, allowing to identify the pieces that can be determined perturbatively from those that require non-perturbative information, and if the non-perturbative pieces can be reliably determined, one can use experimental measurements to extract the short distance effects, sensitive to possible new physics. Without the ability to compute the non-perturbative ingredients from first principles one typically identifies observables for which the non-perturbative information is universal in the sense that it can be extracted from some experimental observables and then used to predict other observables. In this paper we argue that the future ability to use quantum computers to calculate non-perturbative matrix elements from first principles will allow to make predictions for observables with non-universal non-perturbative long-distance physics.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency trends in HPC: what high-energy and astrophysicists need to know</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing energy demands of HPC systems have made energy efficiency a critical concern for system developers and operators. However, HPC users are generally less aware of how these energy concerns influence the design, deployment, and operation of supercomputers even though they experience the consequences. This paper examines the implications of HPC's energy consumption, providing an overview of current trends aimed at improving energy efficiency. We describe how hardware innovations such as energy-efficient processors, novel system architectures, power management techniques, and advanced scheduling policies do have a direct impact on how applications need to be programmed and executed on HPC systems. For application developers, understanding how these new systems work and how to analyse and report the performances of their own software is critical in the dialog with HPC system designers and administrators. The paper aims to raise awareness about energy efficiency among users, particularly in the high energy physics and astrophysics domains, offering practical advice on how to analyse and optimise applications to reduce their energy consumption without compromising on performance.</description>

      <title>Finite group gauge theory on graphs and gravity-like modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gauge theory with finite group $G$ on a graph $X$ using noncommutative differential geometry and Hopf algebra methods with $G$-valued holonomies replaced by gauge fields valued in a `finite group Lie algebra' subset of the group algebra $\mathbb{C} G$ corresponding to the complete graph differential structure on $G$. We show that this richer theory decomposes as a product over the nontrivial irreducible representations $\rho$ with dimension $d_\rho$ of certain noncommutative $U(d_\rho)$-Yang-Mills theories, which we introduce. The Yang-Mills action recovers the Wilson action for a lattice but now with additional terms. We compute the moduli space $\mathcal{A}^\times / \mathcal{G}$ of regular connections modulo gauge transformations on connected graphs $X$. For $G$ Abelian, this is given as expected phases associated to fundamental loops but with additional $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued modes on every edge resembling the metric for quantum gravity models on graphs. For nonAbelian $G$, these modes become positive-matrix valued modes. We study the quantum gauge field theory in the Abelian case in a functional integral approach, particularly for $X$ the finite chain $A_{n+1}$, the $n$-gon $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the single plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We show that, in stark contrast to usual lattice gauge theory, the Lorentzian version is well-behaved, and we identify novel boundary vs bulk effects in the case of the finite chain. We also consider gauge fields valued in the finite-group Lie algebra corresponding to a general Cayley graph differential calculus on $G$, where we study an obstruction to closure of gauge transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first direct ab-initio computation of unequal-time correlation functions in non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate non-trivial consistency relations among correlators, time-translation invariance, and agreement with Monte-Carlo results for thermal equilibrium in 3+1 dimensions by employing our stabilized complex Langevin method. Our work sets the stage to extract real-time observables, relevant to quark-gluon plasma physics within a first-principles real-time framework.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 16$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz thimble-inspired weight regularizations for complex Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numerical sign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that, depending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of the complex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure of the simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight function regularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Our results indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized system exhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction to retrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a direct complex Langevin approach fails. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated using several toy models, including the cosine model and the SU(2) and SU(3) Polyakov chains. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and limitations of this regularization approach for lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ Tetraquark Resonance Close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ Threshold Using Lattice QCD Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD and a coupled-channel Born-Oppenheimer approach to explore the existence of a $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$. A pole in the $\mbox{T}$ matrix signals a resonance with mass $m = 2 m_B + 94.0^{+1.3}_{-5.4} \, \text{MeV}$ and decay width $\Gamma = 140^{+86}_{-66} \, \text{MeV}$, i.e. very close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ threshold. We also compute branching ratios, which clearly indicate that this resonance is mainly composed of a $B^\ast B^\ast$ meson pair with a significantly smaller $B B$ contribution. By varying the potential matrix responsible for the coupling of the $B B$ and the $B^\ast B^\ast$ channel as well as the $b$ quark mass, we provide additional insights and understanding concerning the formation and existence of the resonance. We also comment on the importance of our findings and the main takeaways for a possible future full lattice QCD investigation of this $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$ $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>
