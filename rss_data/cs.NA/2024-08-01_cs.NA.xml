      <title>Quasi-Regression Monte-Carlo scheme for semi-linear PDEs and BSDEs with large scale parallelization on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we design a novel quasi-regression Monte Carlo algorithm in order to approximate the solution of discrete time backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), and we analyze the convergence of the proposed method. The algorithm also approximates the solution to the related semi-linear parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) obtained through the well-known Feynman-Kac representation. For the sake of enriching the algorithm with high-order convergence a weighted approximation of the solution is computed and appropriate conditions on the parameters of the method are inferred. With the challenge of tackling problems in high dimensions we propose suitable projections of the solution and efficient parallelizations of the algorithm taking advantage of powerful many-core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</description>

      <title>Stratified regression Monte-Carlo scheme for semilinear PDEs and BSDEs with large scale parallelization on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a novel algorithm based on Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) in order to approximate the solution of discrete time Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs). Our algorithm allows massive parallelization of the computations on many core processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Our approach consists of a novel method of stratification which appears to be crucial for large scale parallelization. In this way, we minimize the exposure to the memory requirements due to the storage of simulations. Indeed, we note the lower memory overhead of the method compared with previous works.</description>

      <title>High-order quasi-interpolation with generalized Gaussian kernels restricted over tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel and efficient quasi-interpolation scheme with high approximation order for periodic function approximation over tori. The resulting quasi-interpolation takes the form of Schoenberg's tensor-product generalized Gaussian kernels restricted over circles. Notably, theoretical analysis shows that it achieves the highest approximation order equal to the order of the generalized Strang-Fix condition satisfied by the generalized Gaussian kernels. This is in sharp contrast to classical quasi-interpolation counterparts, which often provide much lower approximation orders than those dictated by the generalized Strang-Fix conditions satisfied by the kernels. Furthermore, we construct a sparse grid counterpart for high-dimensional periodic function approximation to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. Numerical simulations provided at the end of the paper demonstrate that our quasi-interpolation scheme is simple and computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit of the Cucker-Smale model with Random Batch Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the mean-field limit of the Random Batch Method (RBM) for the Cucker-Smale model. Different from the classical mean-field limit analysis, the chaos in this model is imposed at discrete time and is propagated to discrete time flux. We approach separately the limits of the number of particles $N\to\infty$ and the discrete time interval $\tau\to 0$ with respect to the RBM, by using the flocking property of the Cucker-Smale model and the observation in combinatorics. The Wasserstein distance is used to quantify the difference between the approximation limit and the original mean-field limit. Also, we combine the RBM with generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and proposed the RBM-gPC method to approximate stochastic mean-field equations, which conserves positivity and momentum of the mean-field limit with random inputs.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, bounds and extrapolation of Block-Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadrature for computing $B^T \phi (A) B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore quadratures for the evaluation of $B^T \phi(A) B$ where $A$ is a symmetric nonnegative-definite matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $B$ is a tall matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$, and $\phi(\cdot)$ represents a matrix function that is regular enough in the neighborhood of $A$'s spectrum, e.g., a Stieltjes or exponential function. These formulations, for example, commonly arise in the computation of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transfer functions for diffusion PDEs.
  We propose an approximation scheme for $B^T \phi(A) B$ leveraging the block Lanczos algorithm and its equivalent representation through Stieltjes matrix continued fractions. We extend the notion of Gauss-Radau quadrature to the block case, facilitating the derivation of easily computable error bounds. For problems stemming from the discretization of self-adjoint operators with a continuous spectrum, we obtain sharp estimates grounded in potential theory for Pad\'e approximations and justify extrapolation algorithms at no added computational cost. The obtained results are illustrated on large-scale examples of 2D diffusion and 3D Maxwell's equations as well as a graph from the SNAP repository. We also present promising experimental results on convergence acceleration via random enrichment of the initial block $B$.</description>

      <title>Stable Rank and Intrinsic Dimension of Real and Complex Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the properties of the stable rank and intrinsic dimension of real and complex matrices to those of the classical rank. Basic proofs and examples illustrate that the stable rank does not satisfy any of the fundamental rank properties, while the intrinsic dimension satisfies a few. In particular, the stable rank and intrinsic dimension of a submatrix can exceed those of the original matrix; adding a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix can lower the intrinsic dimension of the sum; and multiplication by a nonsingular matrix can drastically change the stable rank and the intrinsic dimension. We generalize the concept of stable rank to the p-stable in a Schatten p-norm, thereby unifying the concepts of stable rank and intrinsic dimension: The stable rank is the 2-stable rank, while the intrinsic dimension is the 1-stable rank of a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix. We derive sum and product inequalities for the pth root of the p-stable rank, and show that it is well-conditioned in the norm-wise absolute sense. The conditioning improves if the matrix and the perturbation are Hermitian positive semi-definite.</description>

      <title>Precomputing approach for a two-scale phase transition model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ analytical and numerical techniques to examine a phase transition model with moving boundaries. The model displays two relevant spatial scales pointing out to a macroscopic phase and a microscopic phase, interacting on disjoint inclusions. The shrinkage or the growth of the inclusions is governed by a modified Gibbs-Thomson law depending on the macroscopic temperature, but without accessing curvature information. We use the Hanzawa transformation to transform the problem onto a fixed reference domain. Then a fixed-point argument is employed to demonstrate the well-posedness of the system for a finite time interval. Due to the model's nonlinearities and the macroscopic parameters, which are given by differential equations that depend on the size of the inclusions, the problem is computationally expensive to solve numerically. We introduce a precomputing approach that solves multiple cell problems in an offline phase and uses an interpolation scheme afterward to determine the needed parameters. Additionally, we propose a semi-implicit time-stepping method to resolve the nonlinearity of the problem. We investigate the errors of both the precomputing and time-stepping procedures and verify the theoretical results via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A {\tau} Matrix Based Approximate Inverse Preconditioning for Tempered Fractional Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tempered fractional diffusion equations are a crucial class of equations widely applied in many physical fields. In this paper, the Crank-Nicolson method and the tempered weighted and shifts Gr\"unwald formula are firstly applied to discretize the tempered fractional diffusion equations. We then obtain that the coefficient matrix of the discretized system has the structure of the sum of the identity matrix and a diagonal matrix multiplied by a symmetric positive definite(SPD) Toeplitz matrix. Based on the properties of SPD Toeplitz matrices, we use $\tau$ matrix approximate it and then propose a novel approximate inverse preconditioner to approximate the coefficient matrix. The $\tau$ matrix based approximate inverse preconditioner can be efficiently computed using the discrete sine transform(DST). In spectral analysis, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix are clustered around 1, ensuring fast convergence of Krylov subspace methods with the new preconditioner. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioner.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision HODLR matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the science and engineering community as exploiting data-sparse structures can significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. One particularly popular option within this class is the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal Low-Rank (HODLR) format. In this paper, we show that the off-diagonal blocks of HODLR matrices that are approximated by low-rank matrices can be represented in low precision without degenerating the quality of the overall approximation (with the error growth bounded by a factor of $2$). We also present an adaptive-precision scheme for constructing and storing HODLR matrices, and we prove that the use of mixed precision does not compromise the numerical stability of the resulting HOLDR matrix--vector product and LU factorization. That is, the resulting error in these computations is not significantly greater than the case where we use one precision (say, double) for constructing and storing the HOLDR matrix. Our analyses further give insight on how one must choose the working precision in HOLDR matrix computations relative to the approximation error in order to not observe the effects of finite precision. Intuitively, when a HOLDR matrix is subject to a high degree of approximation error, subsequent computations can be performed in a lower precision without detriment. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through a range of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stable Sparse Operator Inference for Nonlinear Structural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural dynamics models with nonlinear stiffness appear, for example, when analyzing systems with nonlinear material behavior or undergoing large deformations. For complex systems, these models become too large for real-time applications or multi-query workflows. Hence, model reduction is needed. However, the mathematical operators of these models are often not available since, as is common in industry practice, the models are constructed using commercial simulation software. In this work, we propose an operator inference-based approach aimed at inferring, from data generated by the simulation model, reduced-order models (ROMs) of structural dynamics systems with stiffness terms represented by polynomials of arbitrary degree. To ensure physically meaningful models, we impose constraints on the inference such that the model is guaranteed to exhibit stability properties. Convexity of the optimization problem associated with the inference is maintained by applying a sum-of-squares relaxation to the polynomial term. To further reduce the size of the ROM and improve numerical conditioning of the inference, we also propose a novel clustering-based sparsification of the polynomial term. We validate the proposed method on several numerical examples, including a representative 3D Finite Element Model (FEM) of a steel piston rod.</description>

      <title>A Waveguide Port Boundary Condition based on approximation space restriction for Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Waveguide Port Boundary Condition (WPBC) based on the restriction of the approximation space is presented in the context of Finite Element Analysis. As well as reducing the computational domain in the same manner as the traditional WPBC, the proposed scheme further reduces the degrees of freedom at the waveguide ports, simplifies the implementation and seamlessly provides post-processing results such as the reflected power in each waveguide mode. The boundary condition is thoroughly derived, and numerical examples are used as a support for the discussion on topics such as the needed number of modes to be employed at a waveguide port. Finally, a nanograting-based plasmonic sensor is analysed to illustrate further possibilities of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric-based Asymptotic Analysis on Multi-layered Thin Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where certain involved parameters have to be evaluated phenomenologically. In this article, we propose an isogeometric-based asymptotic analysis scheme aimed at achieving a rational modeling and interpretation about the deformation behaviors of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Asymptotic analysis of the three-dimensional governing elasticity equations allows us to gain a deeper insight over shell theories in three aspects. Firstly, the intrinsic hierarchy lying in the displacement field, stress components, constitutive law, and momentum conservation, resulting from the shell thinness, is naturally suggested through asymptotic analysis, and not only the overall stiffness but also the key stress components can be formulated in a fully rational manner. Secondly, through detailed discussion on the order of non-dimensional maximum principal curvature, it is shown that a shell must deform in one of the following two deformation modes. One regime exhibits a mode resembling that of thin plates, while the other corresponds to a piecewise linear distribution of local transverse shear stresses along the thickness. And the specific orders of the key quantities are determined for both cases. Thirdly, in contrast with the existing arguments where an applied shear load on the shell surface necessitates the inclusion of transverse shear stresses for analysis, it is demonstrated that a leading-order shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for the MTS are also presented to show the reliability of the proposed method for shell modeling.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov weights to convey the meaning of time in physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time is not a dimension as the others. In Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) several proposals attempted to adapt the time sampling or time weighting to take into account the specifics of this special dimension. But these proposals are not principled and need guidance to be used. We explain here theoretically why the Lyapunov exponents give actionable insights and propose a weighting scheme to automatically adapt to chaotic, periodic or stable dynamics. We characterize theoretically the best weighting scheme under computational constraints as a cumulative exponential integral of the local Lyapunov exponent estimators and show that it performs well in practice under the regimes mentioned above.</description>

      <title>The Pascal Matrix, Commuting Tridiagonal Operators and Fourier Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the (symmetric) Pascal matrix, in its finite and infinite versions, and prove the existence of symmetric tridiagonal matrices commuting with it by giving explicit expressions for these commuting matrices. This is achieved by studying the associated Fourier algebra, which as a byproduct, allows us to show that all the linear relations of a certain general form for the entries of the Pascal matrix arise from only three basic relations. We also show that pairs of eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix define a natural eigenbasis for the binomial transform. Lastly, we show that the commuting tridiagonal matrices provide a numerically stable means of diagonalizing the Pascal matrix.</description>

      <title>Tree-Cotree-Based Tearing and Interconnecting for 3D Magnetostatics: A Dual-Primal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition. In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, uncertainty in problem data leads to the need for numerous computationally expensive simulations. This report addresses this challenge by developing a penalty-based ensemble algorithm. Building upon Jiang and Layton's work on ensemble algorithms that use a shared coefficient matrix, this report introduces the combination of penalty methods to enhance its capabilities. Penalty methods uncouple velocity and pressure by relaxing the incompressibility condition. Eliminating the pressure results in a system that requires less memory. The reduction in memory allows for larger ensemble sizes, which give more information about the flow and can be used to extend the predictability horizon.</description>

      <title>Variational approximation for a non-isothermal coupled phase-field system: Structure-preservation &amp; Nonlinear stability</title>

Abstract: A Cahn-Hilliard-Allen-Cahn phase-field model coupled with a heat transfer equation, particularly with full non-diagonal mobility matrices, is studied. After reformulating the problem w.r.t. the inverse of temperature, we proposed and analysed a structure-preserving approximation for the semi-discretisation in space and then a fully discrete approximation using conforming finite elements and time-stepping methods. We prove structure-preserving property and discrete stability using relative entropy methods for the semi-discrete and fully discrete case. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Lattice Boltzmann Method for Non-Newtonian Blood Flow in Coiled Intracranial Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms are the leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke. One of the established treatment approaches is the embolization induced by coil insertion. However, the prediction of treatment and subsequent changed flow characteristics in the aneurysm is still an open problem. In this work, we present an approach based on a patient-specific geometry and parameters including a coil representation as inhomogeneous porous medium. The model consists of the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for a non-Newtonian blood rheology. We solve these equations using a problem-adapted lattice Boltzmann method and present a comparison between fully-resolved and volume-averaged simulations. The results indicate the validity of the model. Overall, this workflow allows for patient specific assessment of the flow due to potential treatment.</description>

      <title>Online randomized interpolative decomposition with a posteriori error estimator for temporal PDE data reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional low-rank approximation is a powerful tool to compress the huge data matrices that arise in simulations of partial differential equations (PDE), but suffers from high computational cost and requires several passes over the PDE data. The compressed data may also lack interpretability thus making it difficult to identify feature patterns from the original data. To address these issues, we present an online randomized algorithm to compute the interpolative decomposition (ID) of large-scale data matrices {\em in situ}. Compared to previous randomized IDs that used the QR decomposition to determine the column basis, we adopt a streaming ridge leverage score-based column subset selection algorithm that dynamically selects proper basis columns from the data and thus avoids an extra pass over the data to compute the coefficient matrix of the ID. In particular, we adopt a single-pass error estimator based on the non-adaptive Hutch++ algorithm to provide real-time error approximation for determining the best coefficients. As a result, our approach only needs a single pass over the original data and thus is suitable for large and high-dimensional matrices stored outside of core memory or generated in PDE simulations. A strategy to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed data gradient, when desired, within the ID framework is also presented. We provide numerical experiments on turbulent channel flow and ignition simulations, and on the NSTX Gas Puff Image dataset, comparing our algorithm with the offline ID algorithm to demonstrate its utility in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new hybrid algorithm for computing all singular triplets above a given threshold and provide its implementation in MATLAB/Octave and R. The high performance of our codes and ease at which they can be used, either independently or within a larger numerical scheme, are illustrated through several numerical examples with applications to matrix completion and image compression. Well-documented MATLAB and R codes are provided for public use.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel solution method for It\^o stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We subdivide the time interval into sub-intervals, then we use the quadratic polynomials for the approximation between two successive intervals. The main properties of the stochastic numerical methods, e.g. convergence, consistency, and stability are analyzed. We test the proposed method in SDE problem, demonstrating promising results.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the deep BSDE method for stochastic control problems formulated through the stochastic maximum principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that decision-making problems from stochastic control can be formulated by means of a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). Recently, the authors of Ji et al. 2022 proposed an efficient deep learning algorithm based on the stochastic maximum principle (SMP). In this paper, we provide a convergence result for this deep SMP-BSDE algorithm and compare its performance with other existing methods. In particular, by adopting a strategy as in Han and Long 2020, we derive a-posteriori estimate, and show that the total approximation error can be bounded by the value of the loss functional and the discretization error. We present numerical examples for high-dimensional stochastic control problems, both in case of drift- and diffusion control, which showcase superior performance compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, some of its properties and its relationship to Dowker's sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two finite trigonometric sums $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)\,,$ where $a_l$ are equal either to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ or to $(-1)^{l+1}$, and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$ (marginally, cases $a_l=\ln\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ and $a_l=\Psi\big(l/n\big)$ also appear in the paper). These sums occur in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and play an important part in some number-theoretic problems. Formally, the first of these sums is also the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sums, investigate their properties, derive their complete asymptotical expansions and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for them (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain a useful approximate formula containing only three terms, which is also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Both trigonometric sums appear to be closely related with the digamma function and with the square of the Bernoulli numbers. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the gamma and the digamma functions, in which the first on these sums, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\,\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$, play an important role.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient Splitting Methods for Convex-Concave Saddle-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based a novel primal-dual dynamical model with adaptive scaling parameters and Bregman divergences, we propose new accelerated primal-dual proximal gradient splitting methods for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with provable optimal nonergodic convergence rates. For the first, using the spectral analysis, we show that a naive extension of acceleration model for unconstrained optimization problems to a quadratic game is unstable. Motivated by this, we present an accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (APDHG) flow which combines acceleration with careful velocity correction. To work with non-Euclidean distances, we also equip our APDHG model with general Bregman divergences and prove the exponential decay of a Lyapunov function. Then, new primal-dual splitting methods are developed based on proper semi-implicit Euler schemes of the continuous model, and the theoretical convergence rates are nonergodic and optimal with respect to the matrix norms,\, Lipschitz constants and convexity parameters. Thanks to the primal and dual scaling parameters, both the algorithm designing and convergence analysis cover automatically the convex and (partially) strongly convex objectives. Moreover, the use of Bregman divergences not only unifies the standard Euclidean distances and general cases in an elegant way, but also makes our methods more flexible and adaptive to problem-dependent metrics.</description>
