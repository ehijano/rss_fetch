      <title>The Picard group of the Baily-Borel compactification of the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Picard group of the Baily-Borel compactification of orthogonal Shimura varieties. As a result, we determine the Picard group of the Baily-Borel compactification of the moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces. Interestingly, in contrast to the situation observed in the moduli space of curves, we find that the Picard group of the Baily-Borel compactification is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fibonacci numbers and automorphisms of K3 surfaces with Picard number 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the properties of generalized Fibonacci numbers, we determine the automorphism groups of some K3 surfaces with Picard number 2. Conversely, using the automorphisms of K3 surfaces with Picard number 2, we prove the criterion for a given integer n is to be a generalized Fibonacci number. Moreover, we show that the generalized k-th Fibonacci number divides the generalized q-th Fibonacci number if and only if k divides q.</description>

      <title>Penrose transformation on flag domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our recent work we construct the Penrose transformations of the cohomology groups of homogenous line bundles on flag domains $D=G_\R/T$ with $G_\R$ of Hermitian type. We give sufficient conditions for the injectivity of the Penrose transformations, and conditions under which the Penrose transformation of the automorphic cohomology groups on compact quotients of flag domains is an isomorphism. Finally we prove that the higher automorphic cohomology groups of certain homogeneous line bundles are isomorphic to the groups of automorphic forms on the Hermitian symmetric domain.</description>

      <title>Classification of real hyperplane singularities by real log canonical thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The log canonical threshold (lct) is a fundamental invariant in birational geometry, essential for understanding the complexity of singularities in algebraic varieties. Its real counterpart, the real log canonical threshold (rlct), also known as the learning coefficient, has become increasingly relevant in statistics and machine learning, where it plays a critical role in model selection and error estimation for singular statistical models. In this paper, we investigate the rlct and its multiplicity for real (not necessarily reduced) hyperplane arrangements. We derive explicit combinatorial formulas for these invariants, generalizing earlier results that were limited to specific examples. Moreover, we provide a general algebraic theory for real log canonical thresholds, and present a SageMath implementation for efficiently computing the rlct and its multiplicity in the case or real hyperplane arrangements. Applications to examples are given, illustrating how the formulas also can be used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of high-dimensional volume integrals.</description>

      <title>Cohomology on the incidence correspondence and related questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variety of questions centered around the computation of cohomology of line bundles on the incidence correspondence (the partial flag variety parametrizing pairs consisting of a point in projective space and a hyperplane containing it). Over a field of characteristic zero, this problem is resolved by the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem. In positive characteristic, we give recursive formulas for cohomology, generalizing work of Donkin and Liu in the case of the 3-dimensional flag variety. In characteristic 2, we provide non-recursive formulas describing the cohomology characters in terms of truncated Schur polynomials and Nim symmetric polynomials. The main technical ingredient in our work is the recursive description of the splitting type of vector bundles of principal parts on the projective line. We also discuss properties of the structure constants in the graded Han-Monsky representation ring, and explain how our cohomology calculation characterizes the Weak Lefschetz Property for Artinian monomial complete intersections.</description>

      <title>Residual Intersections and Schubert Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Ulrich and Huneke-Ulrich, we describe a pattern to show that the ideals of certain opposite embedded Schubert varieties defined by this pattern arise by taking residual intersections of two geometrically linked opposite Schubert varieties. This pattern is uniform for the ADE types. Some of the free resolutions of the Schubert varieties in question are important for the structure of finite free resolutions. Our proof is representation theoretical and uniform for our pattern, however it is possible to derive our results using case-by-case analysis and the aid of a computer.</description>

      <title>High-precision black hole scattering with Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend two known constructions that relate regular subdivisions to initial degenerations of projective toric varieties and Grassmannians. We associate a point configuration $A$ with any homogeneous ideal $I$. We obtain upper and lower bounds on each initial ideal of $I$ in terms of regular subdivisions of $A$. Both bounds can be interpreted categorically via limits over face posets of subdivisions. We also investigate when these bounds are exact. This is an extended abstract of a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>The weight hierarchy of decreasing norm-trace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Hamming weights and their relative version, which generalize the minimum distance of a linear code, are relevant to numerous applications, including coding on the wire-tap channel of type II, $t$-resilient functions, bounding the cardinality of the output in list decoding algorithms, ramp secret sharing schemes, and quantum error correction. The generalized Hamming weights have been determined for some families of codes, including Cartesian codes and Hermitian one-point codes. In this paper, we determine the generalized Hamming weights of decreasing norm-trace codes, which are linear codes defined by evaluating monomials that are closed under divisibility on the rational points of the extended norm-trace curve given by $x^{u} = y^{q^{s - 1}} + y^{q^{s - 2}} + \cdots + y$ over the finite field of cardinality $q^s$, where $u$ is a positive divisor of $\frac{q^s - 1}{q - 1}$. As a particular case, we obtain the weight hierarchy of one-point norm-trace codes and recover the result of Barbero and Munuera (2001) giving the weight hierarchy of one-point Hermitian codes. We also study the relative generalized Hamming weights for these codes and use them to construct impure quantum codes with excellent parameters.</description>

      <title>The density and distribution of CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the density and distribution of CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, we prove that the natural density of CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, when ordered by naive height, is zero. Furthermore, we analyze the distribution of these curves among the thirteen possible CM orders of class number one. Our results show that asymptotically, $100\%$ of them have complex multiplication by the order $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2} \right]$, that is, have $j$-invariant 0. We conduct this analysis within two different families of representatives for the $\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphism classes of CM elliptic curves: one commonly used in the literature and another constructed using the theory of twists. As part of our proofs, we give asymptotic formulas for the number of elliptic curves with a given $j$-invariant and bounded naive height.</description>

      <title>Extension of Gorenstein weighted projective 3-spaces and characterization of the primitive curves of their surface sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Gorenstein weighted projective spaces of dimension 3. Given such a space $\mathbf P$, our first focus is its maximal extension in its anticanonical model $\mathbf P \subset \mathbf P^{g+1}$, i.e., the variety $Y\subset \mathbf P^{g+1+r}$ of largest dimension such that $Y$ is not a cone and $\mathbf P$ is a linear section of $Y$. In [DS23] Thomas Dedieu and Edoardo Sernesi have computed the dimension of $Y$ by cohomological computations on the canonical curves inside $\mathbf P$. We give an explicit description of $Y$ in the cases where it was not known. Next, we examine the general anticanonical divisors of $\mathbf P$. These are K3 surfaces, not necessarily primitively polarized. We give a geometric characterization of the curve sections in their primitive polarization.</description>

      <title>Bloch's conjecture for (anti-)autoequivalences on K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Bloch's conjecture for autoequivalence on K3 surfaces. We introduce the notion of reflective autoequivalence of twisted K3 surfaces and prove Bloch's conjecture for such autoequivalences, thereby confirming the conjecture for all (anti-)symplectic autoequivalences of K3 surfaces with Picard number at least $3$. The main idea is that we find a Cartan-Dieudonn\'e type decomposition of (anti)-symplectic autoequivalences.
  Our findings have several interesting consequences. Firstly, we verify Bloch's conjecture for (anti-)symplectic birational automorphisms of Bridgeland moduli space on a K3 surface with Picard number at least $3$. This notably implies that Bloch's conjecture holds for (anti)-symplectic birational automorphisms of finite order ($\neq 2,4$) on arbitrary hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type. Secondly, we extend Huybrechts' work in \cite{Huy12} to twisted K3 surfaces. This extension enables us to affirm Bloch's conjecture for symplectic birational automorphisms on any hyper-K\"ahler variety of $K3^{[n]}$-type preserving a birational Lagrangian fibration. Finally, we prove the constant cycle property for the fixed loci of anti-symplectic involutions on hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type, provided that $n \leq 2$ or the invariant sublattice has rank greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimal models for threefold generalized pairs in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;5$. We show the existence of minimal models for pseudo-effective NQC lc generalized pairs in dimension three over $\mathbb{K}$. As a consequence, we prove the termination of flips for pseudo-effective threefold NQC lc generalized pairs over $\mathbb{K}$. This provides a new proof on the termination of flips for pseudo-effective pairs over $\mathbb{K}$ without using the non-vanishing theorems. A key ingredient of our proof is the ACC for lc thresholds in dimension $\leq 3$ and the global ACC in dimension $\leq 2$ for generalized pairs over $\mathbb{K}$.</description>

      <title>On fundamental forms and osculating bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define higher order fundamental forms and osculating spaces of projective algebraic varieties, using sheaves of principal parts. We show that the $m$th fundamental form can be viewed as the differential of the $(m-1)$th Gauss map, and explain why the vanishing of the $m$th fundamental form implies that the variety is contained in a general $(m-1)$th osculating space. Pointwise, the fundamental forms give linear systems on the projectivized tangent spaces. We show that, at each point, the Jacobian of the $m$th fundamental form is contained in the $(m-1)$th fundamental form. In the case of ruled varieties, we describe these linear systems. We discuss conditions for a surface to be ruled, in terms of the second fundamental form and the Fubini cubic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational normal curves via a connection to the chip firing game. A key technique, introduced in this article, is to interpret the defining ideal of the rational normal curve as an ideal associated to a generalisation of a cycle graph called a parcycle. This association allows us to study rational normal curves by combinatorial methods. Given any Cohen-Macaulay initial monomial ideal of the rational normal curve, we explicitly construct (via this association) a corresponding Gr\"obner degeneration and an explicit combinatorial minimal free resolution of this Gr\"obner degeneration. Applications include minimal cellular resolutions for each Cohen-Macaulay initial monomial ideal of the rational normal curve, explicit combinatorial formulas for Hilbert series of certain lex-segment ideals and a combinatorial perspective on the Eagon-Northcott complex associated to the rational normal curve.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand meets geometric complexity theory: resolving the 2 x 2 permanents of a 2 x n matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the minimal free resolution of the ideal of $2 \times 2$ subpermanents of a $2 \times n$ generic matrix $M$. In contrast to the case of $2 \times 2$ determinants, the $2 \times 2$ permanents define an ideal which is neither prime nor Cohen-Macaulay. We combine work of Laubenbacher-Swanson on the Gr\"obner basis of an ideal of $2 \times 2$ permanents of a generic matrix with our previous work connecting the initial ideal of $2 \times 2$ permanents to a simplicial complex. The main technical tool is a spectral sequence arising from the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand correspondence.</description>

      <title>Twisted Adiabatic Limit for Complex Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $X$ and a smooth positive function $\eta$ thereon, we perturb the standard differential operator $d=\partial + \bar\partial$ acting on differential forms to a first-order differential operator $D_\eta$ whose principal part is $\eta\partial + \bar\partial$. The role of the zero-th order part is to force the integrability property $D_\eta^2=0$ that leads to a cohomology isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of $X$, while the components of types $(0,\,1)$ and $(1,\,0)$ of $D_\eta$ induce cohomologies isomorphic to the Dolbeault and conjugate-Dolbeault cohomologies. We compute Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano-type formulae for the Laplacians induced by these operators and a given Hermitian metric on $X$. The computations throw up curvature-like operators of order one that can be made (semi-)positive under appropriate assumptions on the function $\eta$. As applications, we obtain vanishing results for certain harmonic spaces on complete, non-compact, manifolds and for the Dolbeault cohomology of compact complex manifolds that carry certain types of functions $\eta$. This study continues and generalises the one of the operators $d_h=h\partial + \bar\partial$ that we introduced and investigated recently for a positive constant $h$ that was then let to converge to $0$ and, more generally, for constants $h\in\C$. The operators $d_h$ had, in turn, been adapted to complex structures from the well-known adiabatic limit construction for Riemannian foliations. Allowing now for possibly non-constant functions $\eta$ creates positivity in the curvature-like operator that stands one in good stead for various kinds of applications.</description>

      <title>Sign patterns of principal minors of real symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <title>Global Galois Symbols on E x E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over a number field F, A the abelian surface E x E, and T_F(A) the F-rational albanese kernel of A, which is a subgroup of the degree zero part of Chow group of zero cycles on A modulo rational equivalence. The first result is that for all but a finite number of primes p where E has ordinary reduction, the image of T_F(A)/p in the Galois cohomology group H^2(F, sym^2(E[p])) is zero; here E[p] denotes as usual the Galois module of p-division points on E. The second result is that for any prime p where E has good ordinary reduction, there is a finite extension K of F, depending on p and E, such that T_K(A)/p is non-zero.
  Much of this work was joint with Jacob Murre, and the article is dedicated to his memory.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the essential dimension of reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new technique for proving lower bounds on the essential dimension of split reductive groups. As an application, we strengthen the best previously known lower bounds for various split simple algebraic groups, most notably for the exceptional group $E_8$. In the case of the projective linear group $\operatorname{PGL}_n$, we recover A. Merkurjev's celebrated lower bound with a simplified proof. Our technique relies on decompositions of loop torsors over valued fields due to P. Gille and A. Pianzola.</description>
