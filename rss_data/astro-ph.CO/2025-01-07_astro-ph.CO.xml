      <title>Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. When calculating the properties of the images we expect to see from these lenses, it is typically assumed that each lens is roughly a singular isothermal sphere. In reality, the largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. Focusing on gravitational waves, we compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, as seen elsewhere in the literature. This significant deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of lenses through time domain transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.</description>

      <title>A Critical Reanalysis of Supernova Type Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological parameter fitting remains crucial, especially with the abundance of available data. While many parameters have been tightly constrained, discrepancies-most notably the Hubble tension-persist between measurements obtained from different observational datasets. In this paper, we re-examine the Pantheon supernova dataset to explore deviations in the distribution of distance modulus residuals from the Gaussian distribution, which is typically the underlying assumption. We do this analysis for the concordant cosmological constant model and for a variety of dynamical dark energy models. It has been shown earlier that the residuals in this dataset are better fit to a logistic distribution. We compare the residual distributions assuming both Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods on the complete dataset, as well as various subsets of the data. The results, validated through various statistical tests, demonstrate that the Logistic likelihood provides a better fit for the full dataset and lower redshift bins, while higher redshift bins fit Gaussian and Logistic likelihoods similarly. Furthermore, the findings indicate a preference for a cosmological constant model. However analysing individual surveys within the Pantheon dataset reveals inconsistencies among subsets. The level of agreement between surveys varies depending upon the underlying likelihood function.</description>

      <title>Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.</description>

      <title>Global 21 cm signal: a promising probe of primordial features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k &gt; k^{\rm turn}$ and $k &lt; k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} &lt; k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] &lt; 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Redshift Evolution of Lensing Galaxy Density Slopes via Model-Independent Distance Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong lensing systems, expected to be abundantly discovered by next-generation surveys, offer a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy evolution. The connection between galaxy structure and cosmology through distance ratios highlights the need to examine the evolution of lensing galaxy mass density profiles. We propose a novel, dark energy-model-independent method to investigate the mass density slopes of lensing galaxies and their redshift evolution using an extended power-law (EPL) model. We employ a non-parametric approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained on Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data to reconstruct distance ratios of strong lensing systems. These ratios are compared with theoretical predictions to estimate the evolution of EPL model parameters. Analyses conducted at three levels, including the combined sample, individual lenses, and binned groups, ensure robust and reliable estimates. A negative trend in the mass density slope with redshift is observed, quantified as $\partial\gamma/\partial z = -0.20 \pm 0.12$ under a triangular prior for anisotropy. This study demonstrates that the redshift evolution of density slopes in lensing galaxies can be determined independently of dark energy models. Simulations based on LSST Rubin Observatory forecasts, which anticipate 100,000 strong lenses, show that spectroscopic follow-up of just 10 percent of these systems can constrain the redshift evolution coefficient with uncertainty ($\Delta\partial\gamma/\partial z$) to 0.021. This precision distinguishes evolving and non-evolving density slopes, providing new insights into galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Parametrization Framework for the Deceleration Parameter in Scalar Field Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with a scalar field that represents dark energy. A new parametrization of the deceleration parameter is introduced of the form $q = 1 + \eta (1 + \mu a^{\eta})$ where $\eta$ and $\mu$ are model parameters. and the compatibility of the model is constrained by recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ and Baryon Acoustic Observations. By considering a variable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the universe, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the model are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison is then made with the $\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We examine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and equation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal insights into what has been dubbed "dynamical dark energy" under the assumptions made above. Our method provides a framework that is independent of the model to explore dark energy, leading to a deeper and more subtle understanding of the mechanisms driving late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Testing General Relativity using Large Scale Structures Photometric Redshift Surveys and Cosmic Microwave Background Lensing Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $E_G$ statistic provides a valuable tool for evaluating predictions of General Relativity (GR) by probing the relationship between gravitational potential and galaxy clustering on cosmological scales within the observable universe. In this study, we constrain the $E_G$ statistic using photometric redshift data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) MagLim sample in combination with the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing map. Unlike spectroscopic redshift surveys, photometric redshift measurements are subject to significant redshift uncertainties, making it challenging to constrain the redshift distortion parameter $\beta$ with high precision. We adopt a new definition for this parameter, $\beta(z) = {f\sigma_8(z)}/{b\sigma_8(z)}$. In this formulation, we reconstruct the growth rate of structure, $f\sigma_8(z)$, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) method, while simultaneously utilizing model-independent constraints on the parameter $b\sigma_8(z)$, directly obtained from the DES collaboration. After obtaining the angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$ (galaxy-galaxy) and $C_\ell^{g\kappa}$ (galaxy-CMB lensing) from the combination of DES photometric data and Planck lensing, we derive new measurements of the $E_G$ statistic: $E_G = 0.354 \pm 0.146$, $0.452 \pm 0.092$, $0.414 \pm 0.069$, and $0.296 \pm 0.069$ (68$\%$ C.L.) across four redshift bins: $z = 0.30, 0.47, 0.63$, and $0.80$, respectively, which are consistent with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we forecast the $E_G$ statistic using future photometric redshift data from the China Space Station Telescope, combined with lensing measurements from the CMB-S4 project, indicating an achievable constraint on $E_G$ of approximately 1$\%$, improving the precision of tests for GR on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a non-canonical pseudo-scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-scalar. We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the inflaton.</description>

      <title>Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.
  Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.</description>

      <title>Enabling Strong Neutrino Self-interaction with an Unparticle Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent explorations of the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe have indicated a preference for sizable neutrino self-interactions, much stronger than what the Standard Model offers. When interpreted in the context of simple particle-physics models with a light, neutrinophilic scalar mediator, some of the hints are already in tension with the combination of terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints. We take a novel approach by considering neutrino self-interactions through a mediator with a smooth, continuous, spectral density function. We consider Georgi's unparticle with a mass gap as a concrete example and point out two useful effects for mitigating two leading constraints. 1) The Unparticle is ``broadband'' -- it occupies a wide range of masses which allows it to pass the early universe constraint on effective number of extra neutrinos ($\Delta N_{\rm eff.}$) even if the mass gap lies below the MeV scale. 2) Scattering involving unparticles is less resonant -- which lifts the constraint set by IceCube based on a recent measurement of ultra-high-energy cosmogenic neutrinos. Our analysis shows that an unparticle mediator can open up ample parameter space for strong neutrino self-interactions of interest to cosmology and serves a well-motivated target for upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Role of internal space correlations in the dynamics of a higher-dimensional Bianchi type-I universe: shear scalar and Hubble parameter perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in higher-dimensional, spatially homogeneous Bianchi type-I spacetimes, introducing a real parameter $\lambda$ that correlates the expansion rates of external and internal spaces. Extending beyond Robertson--Walker spacetime, our approach includes positive and negative correlations, suggesting a broader and isotropic/anisotropic cosmological model space. Positively correlated dimensions manifest as a cosmological constant at late times, while at early times, they mimic stiff-fluid-like dark energy that dilutes faster than radiation, paralleling early dark energy models. This suggests a pathway for alleviating the Hubble tension by tailoring higher-dimensional dynamics to reduce the sound horizon. When anisotropic expansion is allowed, these models achieve isotropization more efficiently than predicted by Wald's cosmic no-hair theorem. Negative correlations, in contrast, yield a higher-dimensional steady-state universe where the shear scalar remains constant, effectively emulating a negative cosmological constant. These distinct behaviors arise from a simple signature change: positive correlation accelerates shear scalar decay, while negative correlation stabilizes it. We demonstrate that the solutions admit analytic continuation from the Lorentzian to Euclidean regime ($t \to -i\tau$), revealing a wormhole-like topology that connects two asymptotic regions via a throat, with $\lambda \to -\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of the compact star and its spin-down luminosity. We also project the prospective bounds on these couplings with future measurements of the apparent redshifts of compact stars and of the long-range force between two magnetars in a binary. We analyze the systems of the binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. The bounds on the coupling can be significantly improved by future measurements of compact stars with large magnetic fields, experiments with better sensitivity, and precision clock measurements.</description>

      <title>Concept camera for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift identify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations of two nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible indication of dark matter density spikes. While the evidence is compelling, one issue with this interpretation is that light black holes formed from stellar collapse are not expected to form dark matter spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Since primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this article we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these light black holes.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>Probing cluster magnetism with embedded and background radio sources in Planck clusters</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields remain an enigmatic part of the content of galaxy clusters. Faraday rotation and depolarisation of extragalactic radio sources are useful probes, but the limited availability of polarised radio sources necessitates stacking clusters to study average magnetic field profiles and correlation scales. We recently presented a VLA survey of the 124 most massive Planck clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;0.35$), where a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster impact parameter was found. In this study, we combine the depolarisation information with the observed rotation measure (RM) and present an investigation into the average magnetic field properties of the sample, using both background sources and sources embedded in clusters. We observe a significant increase in the RM scatter, $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$, closer to the cluster centres. Averaging all 124 clusters, we find a scatter within $R_\mathrm{500}$ of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}=209\pm37$ rad m$^{-2}$, with background sources and cluster members showing similar values ($200\pm33$ and $219\pm66$ rad m$^{-2}$, respectively). In the simple assumption of a uniform magnetic field with a single fluctuation scale $\Lambda_c$, this translates to an average magnetic field strength of $2\,(\Lambda_c/10\mathrm{kpc})^{-0.5}\, \mu$G. The profile of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$ as a function of projected radius is inconsistent with a model that has a simple scaling $B \propto n_e^\eta$, with an observed deficit near the centre of clusters possibly caused by the fact that the highest RM sources near the centre of clusters are depolarised. In a full forward model, we find that the magnetic field power spectrum agrees with the Kolmogorov value, but that none of the Gaussian random field models can fully explain the observed relatively flat profiles. This implies that more sophisticated models of cluster magnetic fields in a cosmological context are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1-point matter density probability distribution function (PDF) captures some of the non-Gaussian information lost in standard 2-point statistics. The matter PDF can be well predicted at mildly non-linear scales using large deviations theory. This work extends those predictions to biased tracers like dark matter halos and the galaxies they host. We model the conditional PDF of tracer counts given matter density using a tracer bias and stochasticity model previously used for photometric data. We find accurate parametrisations for tracer bias with a smoothing scale-independent 2-parameter Gaussian Lagrangian bias model and a quadratic shot noise. We relate those bias and stochasticity parameters to the one for the power spectrum and tracer-matter covariances. We validate the model against the Quijote suite of N-body simulations and find excellent agreement for both halo and galaxy density PDFs and their cosmology dependence. We demonstrate the constraining power of the tracer PDFs and their complementarity to power spectra through a Fisher forecast. We focus on the cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ as well as linear bias parameters, finding that the strength of the tracer PDF lies in disentangling tracer bias from cosmology. Our results show promise for applications to spectroscopic clustering data when augmented with a redshift space distortion model</description>

Abstract: Simulations of the dark matter distribution throughout the Universe are essential in order to analyse data from cosmological surveys. $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and many cheaper alternatives (such as lognormal random fields) fail to reproduce accurate statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. In this work, we present \textsc{Psi-GAN} (\textbf{P}ower-\textbf{s}pectrum-\textbf{i}nformed \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etwork), a machine learning model which takes a two-dimensional lognormal dark matter density field and transforms it into a more realistic field. We construct \textsc{Psi-GAN} so that it is continuously conditional, and can therefore generate realistic realisations of the dark matter density field across a range of cosmologies and redshifts in $z \in [0, 3]$. We train \textsc{Psi-GAN} as a generative adversarial network on $2\,000$ simulation boxes from the Quijote simulation suite. We use a novel critic architecture that utilises the power spectrum as the basis for discrimination between real and generated samples. \textsc{Psi-GAN} shows agreement with $N$-body simulations over a range of redshifts and cosmologies, consistently outperforming the lognormal approximation on all tests of non-linear structure, such as being able to reproduce both the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the bispectra of target $N$-body simulations to within ${\sim}5$ per cent. Our improved ability to model non-linear structure should allow more robust constraints on cosmological parameters when used in techniques such as simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>

Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric long-lived dark matter and leptogenesis from type-III seesaw framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model in the type-III seesaw framework to explain the neutrino mass, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We extend the standard model with a vector-like singlet lepton ($\chi$) and a hypercharge zero scalar triplet ($\Delta$) in addition to three hypercharge zero triplet fermions($\Sigma_i~,i=1,2,3$). A $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed under which $\chi$ and $\Delta$ are odd, while all other particles are even. As a result, the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle $\chi$ behaves as a candidate of DM. In the early Universe, the $CP$-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy triplet fermions to the Standard Model lepton ($L$) and Higgs ($H$) generate a net lepton asymmetry, while that of triplet fermions to $\chi$ and $\Delta$ generate a net asymmetric DM. The lepton asymmetry is converted to the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the electroweak sphalerons, while the asymmetry in $\chi$ remains as a DM relic that we observe today. We introduce a singlet scalar $\Phi$, with mass $M_\phi &lt; M_\chi$, which not only assists to deplete the symmetric component of $\chi$ through the annihilation process: $\bar{\chi} \chi \to \Phi \Phi$ but also paves a path to detect DM $\chi$ at direct search experiments through $\Phi-H$ mixing. The electro-weak symmetry breaking induces a non-zero vacuum expectation value to $\Delta$, which leads to an unstable asymmetric DM ranging from a few MeV to hundreds of GeV. We then explore the displaced vertex signatures of the charged components of the scalar triplet $\Delta$ at colliders.</description>

      <title>Identification of $&gt;$40 gravitationally magnified stars in a galaxy at redshift of 0.725</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational magnifications enable to detect faint background sources, resolve their internal structures, and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars allow various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed ``the Dragon arc''), using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the time-domain technique. These events are found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrain stellar types and find that many of them are consistent with red giants/supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals an unprecedented high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc, and proves that {\it JWST}'s time-domain observations open up the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion and manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry. To demonstrate the power of the duality, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations serve as the first example of physically testable cutting rules as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics. We further show how the duality allows us to translate the cosmological optical theorem for wavefunction coefficients into statements about cosmological correlators.</description>

Abstract: The dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber is presently one of the leading technologies to search for dark matter particles with masses below 10 GeV/c$^2$. This was demonstrated by the DarkSide-50 experiment with approximately 50 kg of low-radioactivity liquid argon as target material. The next generation experiment DarkSide-20k, currently under construction, will use 1,000 times more argon and is expected to start operation in 2027. Based on the DarkSide-50 experience, here we assess the DarkSide-20k sensitivity to models predicting light dark matter particles, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and sub-GeV/c$^2$ particles interacting with electrons in argon atoms. With one year of data, a sensitivity improvement to dark matter interaction cross-sections by at least one order of magnitude with respect to DarkSide-50 is expected for all these models. A sensitivity to WIMP--nucleon interaction cross-sections below $1\times10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ is achievable for WIMP masses above 800 MeV/c$^2$. With 10 years exposure, the neutrino fog can be reached for WIMP masses around 5 GeV/c$^2$.</description>

      <title>Cold Collapse and Bounce of a FLRW Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collapse of spherical cold clouds beyond black hole (BH) formation to investigate the possibility of a bounce in the in-falling matter when a critical density or pressure is reached. As a first step, we analyze the pressureless collapse in general relativity (GR), where an analytic solution exists, and demonstrate that an equivalent Newtonian solution can be derived. Such equivalence also holds for spherically symmetric perfect fluids with uniform density and non-vanishing pressure. We numerically investigate the Newtonian collapse of such clouds with masses of $5$, $20$, and $1000$ M$_\odot$ obeying a polytropic equation of state (EoS). By choosing EoS parameters inspired by typical neutron star conditions, we observe bounces at and above nuclear saturation density. Assuming approximate uniformity, we explore the equivalent GR behaviour of the matter during the bounce. Our findings are: i) A GR bounce occurs around the ground state of the matter, characterized by $P = -\rho$. ii) The GR solution significantly differs from the Newtonian result due to the presence of curvature ($k \neq 0$). iii) Both the curvature and the ground state are crucial factors in allowing a GR bounce to occur.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>
