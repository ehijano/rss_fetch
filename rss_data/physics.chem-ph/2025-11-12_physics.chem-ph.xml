      <title>Benchmarking Simulacra AI's Quantum Accurate Synthetic Data Generation for Chemical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we benchmark \simulacra's synthetic data generation pipeline against a state-of-the-art Microsoft pipeline on a dataset of small to large systems. By analyzing the energy quality, autocorrelation times, and effective sample size, our findings show that Simulacra's Large Wavefunction Models (LWM) pipeline, paired with state-of-the-art Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling algorithms, reduces data generation costs by 15-50x, while maintaining parity in energy accuracy, and 2-3x compared to traditional CCSD methods on the scale of amino acids. This enables the creation of affordable, large-scale \textit{ab-initio} datasets, accelerating AI-driven optimization and discovery in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond. Our improvements are based on a novel and proprietary sampling scheme called Replica Exchange with Langevin Adaptive eXploration (RELAX).</description>

      <title>Seniority-Zero Canonical Transformation Theory: Reducing Truncation Error with Late Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to add dynamic correlation to a reference seniority-zero wavefunction by making a unitary transformation of the true electronic Hamiltonian into seniority-zero form. The transformation is treated via the Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) expansion and the seniority-zero structure of the reference is exploited to evaluate the first three commutators exactly; the remaining contributions are handled with a recursive commutator approximation, as is typical in canonical transformation methods. By choosing a seniority-zero reference and using parallel computation, this method is practical for small- to medium-sized systems. Numerical tests show high accuracy, with errors $\sim 10^{-4}$ Hartree.</description>

      <title>Optimized tandem catalyst patterning for CO$_2$ reduction flow reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tandem catalysis involves two or more catalysts arranged in proximity within a single reaction vessel. Each catalyst prefers different reaction pathways and products, and so the tandem design synergistically seeks to leverage the strengths of each and maximize overall system performance and efficiency. This study presents the integration of continuum transport modeling with design optimization in a simplified two-dimensional flow reactor setup for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction, as a proof of concept towards constructing an optimization-based reactor design framework. Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters -- applied surface voltage, electrolyte flow rate, and number of catalyst sections -- the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs, which strongly depend on these input parameters, yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65\%$ compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design. Observed differences in the production and consumption of CO (the key intermediate species) provide insight into increased ethylene production in the optimized cases. The concentration fields highlight how optimized patterns minimize zones of low reactant concentration on the catalyst surface to increase production of high-value further-reduced products.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Networks for learning pressure-dependent kinetic rate laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) have emerged as an interpretable machine learning framework for discovering reaction kinetics directly from data, while strictly adhering to the Arrhenius and mass action laws. However, standard CRNNs cannot represent pressure-dependent rate behavior, which is critical in many combustion and chemical systems and typically requires empirical formulations such as Troe or PLOG. Here, we develop Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (KA-CRNNs) that generalize CRNNs by modeling each kinetic parameter as a learnable function of system pressure using Kolmogorov-Arnold activations. This structure maintains full interpretability and physical consistency while enabling assumption-free inference of pressure effects directly from data. A proof-of-concept study on the CH3 recombination reaction demonstrates that KA-CRNNs accurately reproduce pressure-dependent kinetics across a range of temperatures and pressures, outperforming conventional interpolative models. The framework establishes a foundation for data-driven discovery of extended kinetic behaviors in complex reacting systems, advancing interpretable and physics-consistent approaches for chemical model inference.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric machine learning for molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of electronic wavefunctions is central to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and electronic structure theory. However, conventional ab initio methods require self-consistent optimization of electronic states at every nuclear configuration, leading to prohibitive computational costs, especially for large or strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce a quantum-centric machine learning (QCML) model-a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with Transformer-based machine learning to directly predict molecular wavefunctions and quantum observables. By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction. This work establishes a scalable and transferable quantum-centric machine learning paradigm, bridging variational quantum algorithms and modern deep learning for next-generation molecular simulation and quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Insights into Symmetry and Substitution Patterns Governing Singlet-Triplet Energy Gap in the Chemical Space of Azaphenalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S$_1$) lies below the triplet (T$_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth-generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S$_1$/T$_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S$_1$-T$_1$ gaps computed with the Laplace-transformed second-order coupled-cluster method (L-CC2). To capture substitution-dependent pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ an extrapolative geometry scheme to estimate equilibrium structures at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level. We find three APs to undergo $D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and ten to show $C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry-lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light-emitters.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin relaxation in zero- to ultralow-field magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear-magnetic-resonance experiments can interrogate a broad spectrum of molecular-tumbling regimes and can accurately measure interatomic distances in solution with sub-nanometer resolution. In the zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) regime, population and coherence decay reveal nontrivial behavior due to strong coupling between nuclear spins. We note, in particular, the surprising effects that different resonances show different relaxation rates, depending on (i) the (pre)polarizing magnet field and the shuttling trajectory to the detection region at nano- and microtesla fields, (ii) the strength of the measurement field, (iii) the detection method (single-channel or quadrature), and even (iv) the nutation angle induced by the excitation pulse. We describe herein experimental data of relaxation rates measured for a 13C-labeled formic acid sample, with an atomic-magnetometer-based ZULF setup, and develop a theoretical framework to explain the detected effects and extract molecular properties. The observed effects could be used for spectral assignment, for the establishment of specific motional regimes, for image contrast, and for the characterization of relaxation processes at nano- to microtesla magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Genetically encoding stimulated Raman-scattering probes for cell imaging using infrared fluorescent proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy offers great potential to surpass fluorescent-based approaches, owing to the sharp linewidth of Raman vibrations amenable to super-multiplex cell imaging, but currently lacks one crucial component: genetically encodable tags equivalent to fluorescent proteins. Here, we show that infrared fluorescent proteins (IRFPs) can be used as genetically encoded SRS probes and benefit from the electronic pre-resonant SRS enhancement effect with near-infrared exciting pulses, comparable to synthetic dyes reported in the literature. SRS imaging of the nucleus in mammalian cells is demonstrated where a histone protein is fused to an IRFP. This work opens the route towards Raman-based cell imaging using genetically encoded probes, motivating efforts in solving the challenges of photostability and creating a vibrational palette.</description>

      <title>Collective Vibronic Cascade in Cavity-Coupled Jahn-Teller Active Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Correlations in Aqueous Alkylamine Mixtures Between Molecular and Micro Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how molecular correlations give rise to mesoscale organization is central to the physics of complex fluids such as hydrogen-bonded mixtures. In this work, we develop a mesoscale bridge formalism that connects the site-site Ornstein-Zernike (SSOZ) framework to the field theoretical Teubner-Strey (TS) approach. This bridge highlights how local orientational correlations, typically lost in the SSOZ closure, reemerge as effective long-range components at the mesoscale. The resulting theory provides a unified description of density fluctuations spanning molecular to mesoscopic length scales. The approach is illustrated using X-ray scattering spectra from simulated and experimental hydrogen-bonded fluids, showing that the TS representation captures the essential features of the mesoscale structure. Beyond this specific application, the proposed formalism offers a general route to interpret the structural crossover between microscopic interactions and collective mesoscale organization in complex fluids, including aqueous and amphiphilic systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal Coordinates for Molecular Geometry: from 3D to 5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conformal model (an extension of the homogeneous coordinate system) for molecular geometry, where 3D space is represented within R^5 with an inner product different from the usual one. This model enables efficient computation of interatomic distances using what we call the Conformal Coordinate Matrix (C-matrix). The C-matrix not only simplifies the mathematical framework but also reduces the number of operations required for distance calculations compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum electrodynamic Araki-Sucher correction arising from the interaction between electrons and nuclei is calculated for rovibrational energy levels of the hydrogen molecule and its isotopologues. The corresponding expectation value $\langle r_{en}^{-3}\rangle$ is evaluated across a wide range of internuclear distances using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electronic wave function is represented as a linear combination of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. This correction contributes approximately tenths of a megahertz (about $10^{-5}$cm$^{-1}$) to the dissociation energy of rovibrational levels and to the transitions between them. Given recent spectroscopic measurements with an accuracy of 10 kHz, this correction is necessary to achieve sub-MHz agreement between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Accurate, and Reactive Equivariant Foundation Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</description>
