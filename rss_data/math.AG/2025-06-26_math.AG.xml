      <title>Chern Classes of Toric Variety Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture of Khovanskii-Monin on the Chern classes of toric variety bundles. The main result is a formula for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of a toric variety bundle in terms of the total Chern class of the base and the total Chern class of the toric fibre. The result serves as a simultaneous generalization of the description of the total Chern class of a projectivized vector bundle and of the formula for the total Chern class of a toric variety in terms of the Chern classes of the toric divisors. We also establish a topological version of this statement for stably complex quasitoric manifolds. As an immediate application, we obtain a formula for the total Chern class of a toroidal horospherical variety in terms of the Chern classes of the generalized flag variety and the total Chern class of the toric fibre, as well as a new proof of Masuda's formula for equivariant Chern classes.</description>

      <title>Coherent six-functor formalisms: Pro vs Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical theory for coherent sheaves, the only missing piece in the Grothendieck six-functor formalism picture is $j_!$ for an open immersion $j$. Towards fixing this gap,classically Deligne proposed a construction of $j_!$ by extending the sheaf class to pro sheaves, while Clausen-Scholze provided another solution by extending the sheaf class to solid modules. In this work, we prove that Deligne's construction coincides with the Clausen-Scholze construction via a natural functor, whose restriction to the full subcategory of Mittag-Leffler pro-systems is fully faithful.</description>

      <title>Morphisms on the modular curve $X_0(p)$ and degree $6$ points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We study the morphisms $f:X_0(p)_{\mathbb Q} \to Y$, where $Y/{\mathbb Q}$ is a curve of genus $\geq2$. We prove that for $p&lt;3000$ such an $f$ must be isomorphic to the quotient map $X_0(p)\to X_0^+(p)$. This allows us to classify all points of degree $\leq 25$ on $X_0(p)$ that come from a map to some curve of genus $\geq 2$. As an application, we were able to determine all curves $X_0(p)$ with infinitely many points of degree $6$ over $\mathbb Q$, continuing the previous results on small degree points on $X_0(N)$.</description>

      <title>Intersections of Schubert varieties and smooth $T$-stable subvarieties of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smooth projective variety with an action of a torus admits a cell decomposition, called the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition. Singularities of the closures of these cells are not well-known. One of the examples of such closures is a Schubert variety in a flag variety G/B, and there are several criteria for the smoothness of Schubert varieties. In this paper, we focus on the closures of Bialynicki-Birula cells in regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties Hess(s,h), called Hessenberg Schubert varieties. We first consider the intersection of the Schubert varieties with Hess(s,h) and investigate the irreducibility and the smoothness of this intersection, from which we get a sufficient condition for a Hessenberg Schubert variety to be smooth.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of Certain Exceptional Shimura Varieties into Siegel Modular Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of local Shimura varieties that contains some local Shimura varieties for exceptional groups, and for this class, we construct a functor from $\left(G, \mu\right)$-displays to $p$-divisible groups. As an application, we prove that for this class, the local Shimura variety is representable and perfectoid at the infinite level. Considering the global counterpart of this class, we embed certain exceptional Shimura varieties into Siegel modular varieties. In particular, we prove that they are perfectoid at the infinite level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the geometry of abstract tropical curves, exploring their complete linear system and associated tropical submodules. We establish a lower bound on the dimension of tropical submodules in terms of the Baker-Norine rank. Furthermore, the work provides a characterization of realizable canonical divisors, addressing a fundamental problem in connecting tropical geometry to its algebraic counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any sum of squares in a field of transcendence degree $1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is a sum of $5$ squares, answering a question of Pop and Pfister. We deduce this result from a representation theorem, in $k(C)$, for quadratic forms of rank $\geq 5$ with coefficients in $k$, where $C$ is a curve over a number field $k$.</description>

      <title>On Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing for Cohen-Macaulay schemes of klt type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Cohen-Macaulay scheme of klt type $X$ and a resolution $\pi\colon Y\to X$, we show that $R^1\pi_*\omega_Y=0$. We deduce that if $\mathrm{dim}(X)=3$, then $X$ satisfies Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing and therefore has rational singularities. We also obtain that in arbitrary dimension, if $X$ is of finite type over a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, then $X$ has $\mathbb{Q}_p$-rational singularities.</description>

      <title>Richardson tableaux and components of Springer fibers equal to Richardson varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of Springer fibers and their totally nonnegative counterparts, we define a new subset of standard tableaux called Richardson tableaux. We characterize Richardson tableaux combinatorially using evacuation as well as in terms of a pair of associated reading words. We also characterize Richardson tableaux geometrically, proving that a tableau is Richardson if and only if the corresponding component of a Springer fiber is a Richardson variety, which in turn holds if and only if its positive part is a top-dimensional cell of the totally nonnegative Springer fiber studied by Lusztig (2021). We prove that each such component is smooth by leveraging a combinatorial description of the corresponding pair of reading words, generalizing a result of Graham-Zierau (2011). Another application is that the cohomology classes of these components can be computed in the Schubert basis using Schubert calculus. Finally, we show that the enumeration of Richardson tableaux is surprisingly elegant: the number of Richardson tableaux of fixed partition shape is a product of binomial coefficients, and the number of Richardson tableaux of size $n$ is the $n$th Motzkin number. As a result, we obtain a novel refinement for the Motzkin numbers, as well as a formula for the number of top-dimensional cells in the totally nonnegative Springer fiber.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Cohomology of the Flag Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One hundred years ago, Hilbert gave a list of important open problems in mathematics. His 15th problem asked for the development of a rigorous calculus explaining Schubert's enumerative results for intersecting varieties defined by rank conditions on vector spaces. Today by way of many contributions in algebraic topology, geometry, and combinatorics, we consider this solved. Yet, deep questions remain about the subtleties of actually carrying out the process. In this chapter, we hope to summarize the rigorous development of what has become known as Schubert calculus, with an eye toward computation. We discuss Grassmannians and flag varieties and their cohomology rings, following Monk's constructive algebraic approach. We derive formulas for Schur and Schubert polynomials, which represent cohomology classes of Schubert varieties. We hint at the vast literature in this area and point to the other references in the Handbook for more information. Finally, we identify open problems that remain a challenge even with modern tools at our fingertips in hopes of inspiring further contributions in this fascinating field.
  This is intended as the first chapter of a book entitled "Handbook of Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry: Subvarieties of the Flag Variety", a compendium of topics in the area. The book is being edited by Erik Insko, Martha Precup, and Ed Richmond. In addition to this introductory chapter, others will cover more advanced topics such as Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, generalized smooth Schubert varieties, Richardson varieties and positroid varieties, spherical and torus orbit closures, spanning line configurations, different types of Hessenberg varieties, and generalizations to Kac-Moody flag varieties, each written by experts in those areas. We hope you enjoy this chapter enough to seek out the others, and that you send us any comments or corrections you find as you read this article!</description>

      <title>On the geometry of a 4-dimensional extension of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry type $A_1^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric study of a four-dimensional integrable discrete dynamical system which extends the autonomous form of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry of type $A_1^{(1)}$. By resolution of singularities it is lifted to a pseudo-automorphism of a rational variety obtained from $({\mathbb P}^1)^{\times 4}$ by blowing up along 28 subvarieties and we use this to establish its integrability in terms of conserved quantities and degree growth. We embed this rational variety into a family which admits an action of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})\times \widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})$ by pseudo-isomorphisms. We use this to construct two 4-dimensional analogues of $q$-Painlev\'e equations, one of which is a deautonomisation of the original autonomous integrable map.</description>

In the case where $G$ is a torsion-free hyperbolic group and the underlying variety is irreducible we give a complete description of all algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Constant coefficient and intersection complex $L$-classes of projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a projective variety $X$, we have the intersection complex $L$-classes $L_*(X)$ and $L^{\rm HT}_*(X)$ defined respectively topologically and Hodge-theoretically. These coincide at least if $X$ is a $\mathbb Q$-homology manifold outside a curve. They may be compared with the constant coefficient $L$-class $L^c_*(X)$ defined by applying the $L$-class transformation (or $T_{1*}$) to a cubic hyperresolution of $X$. We show that the two $L$-classes $L^{\rm HT}_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ differ if they do by replacing $X$ with an intersection of general hyperplane sections which has only $\mathbb Q$-homologically isolated singularities. Finding a good sufficient condition for the non-coincidence of $L^{\rm HT}_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ is thus reduced to the latter case, where a necessary and sufficient condition has been obtained in terms of the Hodge signatures of stalks of intersection complex in our previous paper. In the case of projective hypersurfaces having only isolated singularities, the difference between $L_*(X)$ and $L^c_*(X)$ is given by the Hodge signatures of the link cohomologies at singular points, and the Hodge signatures of the vanishing cohomologies give the difference between $L^c_*(X)$ and the virtual $L$-class of $X$, that is, the image by a retraction map of the $L$-class of a smooth deformation of $X$ in an ambient smooth projective variety $Y$ in the very ample case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a comparison functor between ($\mathbf{A}^1$-local) tame motives and ($\overline{\square}$-local) log-\'etale motives over a field $k$ of positive characteristic. This generalizes Binda--Park--{\O}stv{\ae}r's comparison for the Nisnevich topology. As a consequence, we construct an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum $H\mathbb{Z}/p^m$ representing mod $p^m$ tame motivic cohomology: the existence of this ring spectrum and the usual properties of motives imply some results on tame motivic cohomology, which were conjectured by H\"ubner--Schmidt.</description>

      <title>Derived symmetries for crepant contractions to hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a crepant contraction f to a singularity X, we may expect a derived symmetry of the source of f. Under easily-checked geometric assumptions, I construct such a symmetry when X is a hypersurface in a smooth ambient S, using a spherical functor from the derived category of S. I describe this symmetry, relate it to other symmetries, and establish its compatibility with base change.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative refined topological string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>

      <title>Signal Recovery on Algebraic Varieties Using Linear Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recovery of an unknown signal from its linear measurements is a fundamental problem spanning numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. Commonly, prior knowledge suggests that the underlying signal resides within a known algebraic variety. This context naturally leads to a question: what is the minimum number of measurements required to uniquely recover any signal belonging to such an algebraic variety? In this survey paper, we introduce a method that leverages tools from algebraic geometry to address this question. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two problems: phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery. We also highlight several open problems, which could serve as a basis for future investigations in this field.</description>
