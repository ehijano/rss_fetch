      <title>Machine learning automorphic forms for black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular, Jacobi, and mock-modular forms serve as generating functions for BPS black hole degeneracies. By training feed-forward neural networks on Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms derived from the Dedekind eta function, Eisenstein series, and Jacobi theta functions, we demonstrate that machine learning techniques can accurately predict modular weights from truncated expansions. Our results reveal strong performance for negative weight modular and quasi-modular forms, particularly those arising in exact black hole counting formulae, with lower accuracy for positive weights and more complicated combinations of Jacobi theta functions. This study establishes a proof of concept for using machine learning to identify how data is organized in terms of modular symmetries in gravitational systems and suggests a pathway toward automated detection and verification of symmetries in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Symmetries of Planar Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the invariance of all planar Feynman graphs under the Yangian level-one momentum symmetry given certain constraints on the propagator powers. The proof relies on relating this symmetry to a planarized version of the conformal simplices of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis. In particular, this proves a momentum-space analogue of the position-space conformal condition on propagator powers. When combined with the latter, the invariance under the level-one momentum implies full Yangian symmetry of the considered graphs. These include all scalar Feynman integrals for which a Yangian symmetry was previously demonstrated at the level of examples, e.g. the fishnet or loom graphs, as well as generalizations to graphs with massive propagators.</description>

      <title>Multipositivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance, unitarity, and causality enforce powerful constraints on the theory space of physical scattering amplitudes. However, virtually all efforts in this direction have centered on the very simplest case of four-point scattering. In this work, we derive an infinite web of "multipositivity bounds" that nonlinearly constrain all tree-level higher-point scattering amplitudes under similarly minimal assumptions. Our construction rules out several deformations of the string and implies mixed-multiplicity bounds on the Wilson coefficients of planar effective field theories. Curiously, an infinite class of multipositivity bounds is exactly saturated by the amplitudes of the open string.</description>

      <title>Curvature divergences in 5d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scalar curvature $R$ of the vector moduli space of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravities, obtained by compactifying M-theory on a Calabi--Yau three-fold. We find that $R$ can only diverge at points where some gauge interactions go to infinite coupling in Planck units and become SCFTs or LSTs decoupled from gravity and other vector multiplets. For 5d SCFTs of rank $r\leq 2$ divergences occur if, additionally, the SCFT still couples to the vevs of such vector multiplets, so that along its Coulomb branch its gauge kinetic matrix and/or string tensions depend on some non-dynamical parameters. If the strong coupling singularity is better understood as a 6d $(1,0)$ SCFT, as in some decompactification limits, then divergences in $R$ arise when the SCFT is endowed with a non-Abelian gauge group.</description>

      <title>Instantons and Vermas: the Abelian Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the action of instanton operators on the BPS Hilbert space of 5d maximal super Yang-Mills. We compute the matrix elements of instanton operators using supersymmetric localisation on the spacetime C2 times [0, 1] with an omega-background along C2. The localisation requires a novel BPS boundary condition of the 5d gauge theory. We show that the path integral localizes to correspondences defined by Nakajima and the instanton operators coincide with his operators. We uplift the computations to 6d (1,1) super Yang-Mills. The computations lead to an uplift of the commutation relationships of instanton operators on equivariant cohomology to K-theory. Finally, we reproduce a U(1) version of the AGT correspondence by studying the action of instanton operators on boundary coherent states. This work is an attempt to uplift "Vortices and Vermas" to 5d maximal super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative fields in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we discuss dynamics of noncommutative (NC) matter fields in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black hole background. After reviewing the propagation of charged NC scalar and spinor fields, we derive the equation governing the propagation of NC electromagnetic (EM) perturbation in the RN background. The propagation of NC scalar and spinor perturbation have a dual description in terms of the propagation of commutative fields in the effective/dual metric. Finally, we turn to the gravitational perturbations. We present equations of motion for the NC gravitational field obtained in two different models: $SO(2,3)_\star$ NC gravity and braided NC gravity. Typically for NC gravity models, the first nontrivial corrections are quadratic in the NC parameter. The obtained NC gravity equations are the starting point to discuss the propagation of NC gravitational perturbations and the validity of the dual description in terms of the effective metric.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft line in 4D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory and a microscopic description of dyon's statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lattice gauge theory with compact gauge field variables, an introduction of the gauge field topology requires the assumption that lattice field configurations are sufficiently smooth. This assumption is referred to as the admissibility condition. However, the admissibility condition always ensures the Bianchi identity, and thus prohibits the existence of magnetic objects such as the 't~Hooft line. Recently, in 2D compact scalar field theory, Ref.~\cite{Abe:2023uan} proposed a method to define magnetic objects without violating the admissibility condition by introducing holes into the lattice. In this paper, we extend this ``excision method'' to 4D Maxwell theory and propose a new definition of the 't~Hooft line on the lattice. Using this definition, we first demonstrate a lattice counterpart of the Witten effect which endows the 't~Hooft line with electric charge and make it a dyon. Furthermore, we show that by interpreting the 't~Hooft line as a boundary of the lattice system, the statistics of the dyon can be directly read off. We also explain how the dyonic operator which satisfies the Dirac quantization condition becomes a genuine loop operator even at finite lattice spacings.</description>

      <title>The Electroweak Sphaleron Revisited: I. Static Solutions, Energy Barrier, and Unstable Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electroweak sphaleron is a static, unstable solution of the Standard Model classical field equations, representing the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua. In this work, we present a comprehensive updated analysis of the sphaleron using current Standard Model parameters with the physical Higgs boson mass of $m_H = 125.1$ GeV and $m_W = 80.4$ GeV, rather than the $m_H = m_W$ approximation common in earlier studies. The study includes: (i) a complete derivation of the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ electroweak Lagrangian and field equations without gauge fixing constraints, (ii) high-precision numerical solutions for the static sphaleron configuration yielding a sphaleron energy $E_{\rm{sph}} \simeq 9.1$ TeV, (iii) an analysis of the minimum energy path in field space connecting the sphaleron to the vacuum (a 1D potential barrier as a function of Chern-Simons number), and (iv) calculation of the sphaleron single unstable mode with negative eigenvalue $\omega^2_{-} = -2.7m^2_W$, providing analytical fits for its eigenfunction. We find that using the measured Higgs mass modifies the unstable mode frequency, with important implications for baryon number violation rates in both early universe cosmology and potential high-energy collider signatures. These results provide essential input for accurate lattice simulations of sphaleron transitions and precision calculations of baryon number violation processes.</description>

      <title>The Electroweak Sphaleron Revisited: II. Study of Decay Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of electroweak sphaleron decay dynamics, employing both analytical techniques and high-resolution numerical simulations. Using a spherically symmetric ansatz, we reformulate the system as a $(1+1)$-dimensional problem and analyze its stability properties with current Standard Model parameters ($m_H = 125.1$ GeV, $m_W = 80.4$ GeV). We identify precisely one unstable mode with eigenvalue $\omega_{-}^2 \simeq -2.7m_W^2$ and numerically evolve the full non-linear field equations under various initial conditions. Through spectral decomposition, we quantify the particle production resulting from the sphaleron decay. Our results demonstrate that the decay process is dominated by transverse gauge bosons, which constitute approximately 80% of the total energy and multiplicity, while Higgs bosons account for only 7-8%. On average, the sphaleron decays into 49 $W$ bosons and 4 Higgs bosons. The particle spectra consistently peak at momenta $k \sim 1 - 1.5 \, m_W$, reflecting the characteristic size of the sphaleron. Remarkably, these properties remain robust across different decay scenarios, suggesting that the fundamental structure of the sphaleron, rather than specific triggering mechanisms, determines the decay outcomes. These findings provide distinctive experimental signatures of non-perturbative topological transitions in the electroweak theory, with significant implications for baryon number violation in the early universe and potentially for high-energy collider physics.</description>

      <title>Periodic Kerr solution as an infinite soliton chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine numerical analysis with the inverse scattering method to study the periodic analog of Kerr solution. The periodic analog of the Schwarzschild solution is known to be regular and exhibit Kasner asymptotic behaviour for an arbitrary size of event horizon not exceeding the period. The previous numerical analysis of the rotating version of the periodic Schwarzschild black hole in [arXiv:2210.12898] based on the heat flow, together with analytical results in [arXiv:2407.16960] shows that there exist obstructions to putting the periodic Schwarzschild solution in rotation in a certain parameter range. In this paper we apply an efficient numerical approach based on the inverse scattering method, interpreting the periodic Kerr solution as an infinite chain of solitons. This allows to completely describe the existence domain in the space of physical parameters (the period, mass and the angular momentum); we study the dependence of Kasner exponent and the shape of the ergosphere on parameters of the problem.</description>

      <title>Scattering Entanglement Entropy and Its Implications for Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between the entanglement entropy in scattering processes and the dynamics of electroweak phase transitions. Recent work has shown that the scattering entanglement entropy can provide new insight into Standard Model parameters. In this study, we propose that the maximum of the entanglement entropy in scattering amplitudes may serve as a diagnostic for first-order electroweak phase transitions in the early universe. We analyze a simplified extension of the Standard Model consisting of the Higgs boson $h$ coupled to $O(N)$ real singlet scalars $S$ via the Higgs portal coupling $\lambda_{hS}$. By explicitly calculating the maximum entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that it grows with increasing $\lambda_{hS}$, and that both first-order and strong first-order electroweak phase transitions are favored in regions of parameter space with large maximum entropy. Our results suggest that entanglement-based observables may encode meaningful information about the underlying dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide a novel perspective on phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME), a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly, induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME remains effective and plays a significant role in the magnetic field evolution of magnetars. The magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and, within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14}$ G at the expense of small-scale structures. Our results offer a microphysical mechanism, alternative to traditional hydrodynamic dynamo models, establishing a new framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometric formulation of effective field theories via nonlinear supersymmetry. Non-supersymmetric particles are embedded in constrained superfields governed by a nonlinear sigma model, and operators are collected into potentials on the target space. The use of chiral superfields standardizes the treatment of flavor across scalars and fermions, and the minimal jet bundle extension makes invariance under derivative field redefinitions manifest.</description>

      <title>Quantum fermion superradiance and vacuum ambiguities on charged black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike a classical charged bosonic field, a classical charged fermion field on a static charged black hole does not exhibit superradiant scattering. We demonstrate that the quantum analogue of this classical process is however present. We construct a vacuum state for the fermion field which has no incoming particles from past null infinity, but which contains, at future null infinity, a nonthermal flux of particles. This state describes both the discharge and energy loss of the black hole, and we analyze how the interpretation of this phenomenon depends on the ambiguities inherent in defining the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Linearization (in)stabilities and crossed products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Coupling Self-Dual p-Form Gauge Fields to Self-Dual Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, $p$-form gauge fields (with $p=2k$) with self-dual field strengths couple naturally to dyonic branes with equal electric and magnetic charges. Sen's action for a $p$-form gauge field with self-dual field strength coupled to a spacetime metric $g$ involves an explicit Minkowski metric; however, this action can be generalised to provide a theory in which the Minkowski metric is replaced by a second metric $\bar g$ on spacetime. This theory describes a physical sector, consisting of the chiral $p$-form gauge field coupled to the dynamical metric $g$, plus an auxiliary sector consisting of a second chiral $p$-form and the second metric $\bar g$. The fields in this auxiliary sector only couple to each other and have no interactions with the physical sector. However, in this theory, the standard coupling to a brane given by integrating the gauge potential over the world-volume of the brane is problematic as the physical gauge potential depends non-locally on the fields appearing in the action. A consistent coupling is given by introducing Dirac branes (generalising Dirac strings), and is shown to have generalised symmetries corresponding to invariance under deforming the positions of the Dirac branes, provided the Dirac branes do not intersect any physical brane world-volumes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Schwarzschild-(A)dS Black Holes: Unitarity and Singularity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the canonical quantisation of spherically symmetric spacetimes within unimodular gravity, leaving sign choices in the metric general enough to include both the interior and exterior Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter spacetime. In unimodular gravity the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant analogous to a total energy, and the quantum Wheeler-DeWitt equation takes the form of a Schr\"odinger equation in unimodular time. We discuss self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger-like Hamiltonian arising from the requirement of unitarity in unimodular time, and identify a physically motivated one-parameter family of extensions. For semiclassical states we are able to derive analytical expressions for expectation values of the metric, representing a quantum-corrected, nonsingular extension of the classical Schwarzschild-(A)dS geometry which describes a quantum transition between asymptotic black hole and white hole states. The sign of the self-adjoint extension parameter corresponds to the allowed sign of the black hole/white hole mass, and so it can be chosen to ensure that this mass is always positive. We also discuss tunnelling states which allow for a change in the sign of the mass, but which are not semiclassical in high-curvature regions. Our mechanism for singularity resolution and the explicit form of the quantum-corrected metric can be compared to other proposals for black holes in quantum gravity, and in the asymptotically AdS case can be contrasted with holographic arguments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of symmetries in the Causal Loop-Tree Duality representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. In this paper, we study the symmetries underlying the causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) representations through a {graph-theoretic} analysis. Focusing on the integrand-level representations of $N$-point functions at one loop, we examine their degeneration and discover that different causal representations are interconnected through specific transformations arising from the symmetries of cut diagrams. Furthermore, the degeneration is linked to algebraic constraints among the different causal thresholds. Our findings shed new light on the deeper structures of Feynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

Abstract: The theory of graphical functions is generalized from scalar theories to theories with spin, leading to a numerator structure in Feynman integrals. The main part of this article treats the case of positive integer spin, which is obtained from spin $1/2$ theories after the evaluation of $\gamma$ traces. As an application (in this article used mainly to prove consistency and efficiency of the method), we calculate primitive Feynman integrals in Yukawa-$\phi^4$ (Gross-Neveu-Yukawa) theory up to loop order eight.</description>

Abstract: We study the boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class, in the presence of a bidimensional surface. By means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where leading bulk scaling corrections are suppressed, we prove the existence of a special phase transition, with unusual exponents, and of an extraordinary phase with logarithmically decaying correlations. These findings contrast with na\"ive arguments on the bulk-surface phase diagram, and allow us to explain some recent puzzling results on the boundary critical behavior of quantum spin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a within 10\% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The irreversible relaxation of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the results of a previous analysis of the Markovian master equation for the irreversible evolution of an open system embedded in de Sitter space, we include in the cosmological Friedmann equations a contribution from the presence of a physical bath at temperature $T_{\rm dS} = h / 2 \pi$, where $h$ is the Hubble parameter. We show that this provides a mechanism for the irreversible relaxation of the cosmological constant and a graceful exit to inflation, without need for subsequent reheating. Thermal particle production during inflation gives adiabatic, Gaussian, and approximately scale-invariant cosmological perturbations. We thus obtain the main features of inflation without any inflaton potential. To clarify the thermodynamic interpretation of these results, we consider the analogy of this irreversible relaxation to superfluorescence in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Breaking the degeneracy of non-canonical quartic inflation by reheating considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ within a non-canonical framework characterized by a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this model align with the Planck 2018 observational data. We explore how the predictions of the model depend on the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. Notably, the sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all affected by variations in $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits a degeneracy with respect to variation in $\alpha$, which can be broken by incorporating reheating consideration. By applying a combination of theoretical and observational constraints on $(r-n_{\rm s})$, non-Gaussianity, and reheating parameters, we find that the duration of inflation is constrained to the range $55 \leq N\leq55.7$ $e$-folds for $60 \leq \alpha \leq 130$. Finally, we investigate relic gravitational waves and demonstrate that their energy density spectrum falls within the sensitivity range of gravitational waves detectors for this constrained range of $e$-folds.</description>

Abstract: We re-consider the graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. On flat space background it can be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on scalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential operators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the linearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution which we derive here.</description>

      <title>Late Time Phenomena in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ Gravity Framework: Role of $H_0$ Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explored the behavior of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ cosmological model with the use of various data set combinations. We also compared the results for this model between the Pantheon+ (without SH0ES) and the Pantheon+\&amp;SH0ES (with SH0ES) data sets. Additionally, we incorporated data from BAO along with $H_0$ priors. We observed that integrating SH0ES data points leads to a higher estimation of $H_0$ than Pantheon+ (without SH0ES). We perform an extensive MCMC analysis for each combination of data sets, providing constraints on the model parameters. We also computed the $\chi^2_{min}$ value for each combination of data sets to evaluate the chosen model against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our primary finding is that the various dataset combinations in the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ model we examined relate to a range of Hubble constants, which could contribute to reducing the cosmic tension associated with this parameter. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of matter fluctuations by solving the density contrast evolution equation numerically. We calculate numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_8$ using these findings. We plotted the cosmological background parameters to check the behavior of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ model in late-time. Based on the behavior of these background cosmological parameters, we conclude that our selected models reflect the late-time cosmic dynamics of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Factorisation schemes for proton PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond leading-order, perturbative QCD requires a choice of factorisation scheme to define the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and hard-process cross-section. The modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$) scheme has long been adopted as the default choice due to its simplicity. Alternative schemes have been proposed with specific purposes, including, recently, PDF positivity and NLO parton-shower matching. In this paper we assemble these schemes in a common notation for the first time. We perform a detailed comparison of their features, both analytically and numerically, and estimate the resulting factorisation-scheme uncertainty for LHC phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in non-linear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where non-linear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterizations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>
