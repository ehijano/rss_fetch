      <title>On the Learnability of Knot Invariants: Representation, Predictability, and Neural Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze different aspects of neural network predictions of knot invariants. First, we investigate the impact of different knot representations on the prediction of invariants and find that braid representations work in general the best. Second, we study which knot invariants are easy to learn, with invariants derived from hyperbolic geometry and knot diagrams being very easy to learn, while invariants derived from topological or homological data are harder. Predicting the Arf invariant could not be learned for any representation. Third, we propose a cosine similarity score based on gradient saliency vectors, and a joint misclassification score to uncover similarities in neural networks trained to predict related topological invariants.</description>

      <title>A plumbing-multiplicative function from the Links-Gould invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Laurent polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm 1}]$ that is the top coefficient of the Links-Gould invariant of the boundary of a Seifert surface is multiplicative under plumbing of surfaces. We deduce that the Links-Gould invariant of a fibred link in $S^3$ is $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm 1}]$-monic. As a purely topological application, we deduce a ``plumbing-uniqueness'' statement for links that bound surfaces obtained by plumbing/deplumbing unknotted twisted annuli as well as providing an obstruction for links to bound such surfaces.</description>

      <title>High dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an iterative procedure for constructing hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber over $\mathbb{Z}$ that is flexible enough to yield infinitely many isomorphism classes in each virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) $n\geq 2$. Our procedure combines results of Jankiewicz, Norin, and Wise with a generalization of a construction due to Osajda involving a new simplicial thickening process. We also give a topological argument showing that the vcd of the right-angled Coxeter groups produced by our construction increases by exactly one with each iteration, guaranteeing that our process produces examples of every vcd.</description>

      <title>Volumes of odd strata of quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the Masur--Veech volumes of "completed" strata of quadratic differentials with only odd singularities as a sum over stable graphs. This formula generalizes the formula of Delecroix-Goujard-Zograf-Zorich for principal strata. The coefficients of the formula are in our case intersection numbers of psi classes with the Witten-Kontsevich combinatorial classes; they naturally appear in the count of metric ribbon graphs with prescribed odd valencies. The "completed" strata that we consider are unions of odd strata and some adjacent strata, that contribute to the Masur--Veech volume with explicit weights. We present several conjectures on the large genus asymptotics of these Masur--Veech volumes that could be tackled with this formula.</description>

      <title>Some non-trivial cycles of the space of long embeddings detected by configuration space integral invariants using g-loop (g =2, 3) graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give some non-trivial geometric cycles of the space of long embeddings R^j --&gt; R^n (n-j &gt;= 2) modulo immersions. We construct a class of cycles from specific chord diagrams associated with the 2-loop or 3-loop hairy graphs. To detect these cycles, we use cocycles obtained by the 2-loop or 3-loop part of modified configuration space integrals using a modified Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi graph complex. We show the non-triviality of the cycles by pairing argument, which is reduced to pairing of graphs with the chord diagrams. As a corollary of the 2-loop part, we provide an alternative proof of the non-finite generation of the (j-1)-th rational homotopy group of the space of long embeddings of codimension two, which Budney--Gabai and Watanabe first established. We also show the non-finite generation of the 2(j-1)-th homotopy group by using the 3-loop part.</description>

      <title>Closed hyperbolic manifolds without $\text{spin}^c$ structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In all dimensions $n \ge 5$, we prove the existence of closed orientable hyperbolic manifolds that do not admit any $\text{spin}^c$ structure, and in fact we show that there are infinitely many commensurability classes of such manifolds. These manifolds all have non-vanishing third Stiefel--Whitney class $w_3$ and are all arithmetic of simplest type. More generally, we show that for each $k \ge 1$ and $n \ge 4k+1$, there exist infinitely many commensurability classes of closed orientable hyperbolic $n$-manifolds $M$ with $w_{4k-1}(M) \ne 0$.</description>

      <title>Skeins on Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 1-parameter families of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We show that the expected codimension-1 phenomena can be organized to match the HOMFLYPT skein relations from quantum topology. It follows that counting holomorphic curves by the class of their boundaries in the skein module of the Lagrangian gives a deformation invariant result. This is a mathematically rigorous incarnation of Witten's assertion that boundaries of open topological strings create line defects in Chern-Simons theory.
  Using this theory, we rigorously establish the following prediction of Ooguri and Vafa: the coefficients of the HOMFLYPT polynomial of a link in the three-sphere count the holomorphic curves in the resolved conifold, with boundary on (a pushoff of) the link conormal.</description>

      <title>On hidden face contributions of configuration space integrals for long embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Configuration space integrals are powerful tools for studying the homotopy type of the space of long embeddings in terms of a combinatorial object called a graph complex. It is unknown whether these integrals give a cochain map due to potential obstructions called hidden faces. The purpose of this paper is to address these hidden faces by modifying configuration space integrals: we incorporate the acyclic bar complex of some dg algebra into the original graph complex, without changing its cohomology. Then, we give a cochain map from the new graph complex to the de Rham complex of the space of long embeddings modulo immersions, by combining the original configuration space integrals with Chen's iterated integrals. As the original complex, we choose quite a modified graph complex so that it is quasi-isomorphic to both the hairy graph complex and a graph complex introduced in the context of embedding calculus.</description>
