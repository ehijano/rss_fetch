      <title>Understanding complex crowd dynamics with generative neural simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01491v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge crucial for designing efficient urban infrastructure and ensuring safe crowd management. To this end, both small-scale laboratory and large-scale real-world measurements have been used. However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven Neural Crowd Simulator (NeCS), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topological nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Classifying pedestrian crossing flows: A data-driven approach using fundamental diagrams and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of pedestrian crossing flows with varying crossing angles $\alpha$ to classify different scenarios and derive implications for crowd management. Probability density functions of four key features$-$velocity $v$, density $\rho$, avoidance number $Av$, and intrusion number $In$$-$were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior. Velocity-density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each $\alpha$ and fitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attempts using $Av$-$In$ and $v$-$\rho$ phase spaces revealed significant overlaps, highlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenario differentiation. To address this, machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Results showed robust classification performance, with $v$ and $Av$ contributing most significantly. Insights from feature importance metrics and classification accuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizing pedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces. These findings provide a data-driven framework for advancing pedestrian dynamics research.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>Synchronization transitions in adaptive simplicial complexes with cooperative and competitive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive network is a powerful presentation to describe different real-world phenomena. However, current models often neglect higher-order interactions (beyond pairwise interactions) and diverse adaptation types (cooperative and competitive) commonly observed in systems like the human brain and social networks. This work addresses this gap by incorporating these factors into a model that explores their impact on collective properties like synchronization. Through simplified network representations, we investigate how the simultaneous presence of cooperative and competitive adaptations influences phase transitions. Our findings reveal a transition from first-order to second-order synchronization as the strength of higher-order interactions increases under competitive adaptation. We also demonstrate the possibility of synchronization even without pairwise interactions, provided there is strong enough higher-order coupling. When only competitive adaptations are present, the system exhibits second-order-like phase transitions and clustering. Conversely, with a combination of cooperative and competitive adaptations, the system undergoes a first-order-like phase transition, characterized by a sharp transition to the synchronized state without reverting to an incoherent state during backward transitions. The specific nature of these second-order-like transitions varies depending on the coupling strengths and mean degrees. With our model, we can control not only when the system synchronizes but also the way the system goes to synchronization.</description>

      <title>How the use of feature selection methods influences the efficiency and accuracy of complex network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex network systems' models are designed to perfectly emulate real-world networks through the use of simulation and link prediction. Complex network systems are defined by nodes and their connections where both have real-world features that result in a heterogeneous network in which each of the nodes has distinct characteristics. Thus, incorporating real-world features is an important component to achieve a simulation which best represents the real-world. Currently very few complex network systems implement real-world features, thus this study proposes feature selection methods which utilise unsupervised filtering techniques to rank real-world node features alongside a wrapper function to test combinations of the ranked features. The chosen method was coined FS-SNS which improved 8 out of 10 simulations of real-world networks. A consistent threshold of included features was also discovered which saw a threshold of 4 features to achieve the most accurate simulation for all networks. Through these findings the study also proposes future work and discusses how the findings can be used to further the Digital Twin and complex network system field.</description>

      <title>The behavior of rich-club coefficient in scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich-club phenomenon, which provides information about the association between nodes, is a useful method to study the hierarchy structure of networks. In this work, we explore the behavior of rich-club coefficient (RCC) in scale-free networks, and find that the degree-based RCC is a power function of degree centrality with power exponent $\beta$ and the betweenness-based RCC is a linear function of betweenness centrality with slope $\theta$. Moreover, we calculate the value of RCC in a BA network by deleting nodes and obtain a general expression for RCC as a function of node sequence. On this basis, the solution of RCC for centrality is also obtained, which shows that the curve of RCC is determined by the centrality distribution. In the numerical simulation, we observe: $\beta$ and $\gamma$ (the degree distribution exponent) increase together, $\theta$ increases with the average degree and decreases to convergence as $\gamma$ increases.</description>

      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), that incorporates the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimal minimizing exit time. We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with $N$ nodes, for which the exit time scales as ${\cal A}\ln N$, where the prefactor ${\cal A}$ depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coevolution on social models couples the time evolution of the network with the time evolution of the states of the agents. This paper presents a new coevolution dynamic allowing more than one rewiring on the network. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for problem-solving capability of task-forces. We used an agent-based model study how this new coevolution dynamic can help a group of agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Each agent can replace more than one neighbors, and this quantity is a tunable parameter in the model. These rewirings is a way for the agent to obtain information from individuals that were not previously part of its neighborhood. Our results showed that this tunable coevolution can indeed produce gain on the computational cost under certain circunstances. At low average degree (using a random network to connect the agents) and on easy landscape, more rewirings return lower cost, helping the agents to find the global maximum faster. However, at larger average degree and difficult landscape, the effect is more complex. At medium size systems, the coevolution brings optimal results when 3 or 4 neighbors are replaced.</description>
