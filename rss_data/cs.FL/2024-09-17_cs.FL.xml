      <title>Well-Behaved (Co)algebraic Semantics of Regular Expressions in Dafny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular expressions are commonly understood in terms of their denotational semantics, that is, through formal languages -- the regular languages. This view is inductive in nature: two primitives are equivalent if they are constructed in the same way. Alternatively, regular expressions can be understood in terms of their operational semantics, that is, through deterministic finite automata. This view is coinductive in nature: two primitives are equivalent if they are deconstructed in the same way. It is implied by Kleene's famous theorem that both views are equivalent: regular languages are precisely the formal languages accepted by deterministic finite automata. In this paper, we use Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, to formally verify, for the first time, what has been previously established only through proofs-by-hand: the two semantics of regular expressions are well-behaved, in the sense that they are in fact one and the same, up to pointwise bisimilarity. At each step of our formalisation, we propose an interpretation in the language of Coalgebra. We found that Dafny is particularly well suited for the task due to its inductive and coinductive features and hope our approach serves as a blueprint for future generalisations to other theories.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making for autonomous driving incorporating different types of risks is a challenging topic. This paper proposes a novel risk metric to facilitate the driving task specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) by balancing the risk brought up by different uncertain events. Such a balance is achieved by discounting the costs of these uncertain events according to their timing and severity, thereby reflecting a human-like awareness of risk. We have established a connection between this risk metric and the occupation measure, a fundamental concept in stochastic reachability problems, such that a risk-aware control synthesis problem under LTL specifications is formulated for autonomous vehicles using occupation measures. As a result, the synthesized policy achieves balanced decisions across different types of risks with associated costs, showcasing advantageous versatility and generalizability. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</description>

      <title>Efficient Analysis of Unambiguous Automata Using Matrix Semigroup Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.10093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to analyse unambiguous B\"uchi automata quantitatively, and apply this to the model checking problem. It is based on linear-algebra arguments that originate from the analysis of matrix semigroups with constant spectral radius. This method can replace a combinatorial procedure that dominates the computational complexity of the existing procedure by Baier et al. We analyse the complexity in detail, showing that, in terms of the set $Q$ of states of the automaton, the new algorithm runs in time $O(|Q|^4)$, improving on an efficient implementation of the combinatorial algorithm by a factor of $|Q|$.</description>

      <title>Normal Forms for Elements of ${}^*$-Continuous Kleene Algebras Representing the Context-Free Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the tensor product $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ of any ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $K$ with the polycyclic ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2'$ over two bracket pairs there is a copy of the fixed-point closure of $K$: the centralizer of $C_2'$ in $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$. Using an automata-theoretic representation of elements of $K\mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ \`a la Kleene, with the aid of normal form theorems that restrict the occurrences of brackets on paths through the automata, we develop a foundation for a calculus of context-free expressions without variable binders. We also give some results on the bra-ket ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2$, motivate the ``completeness equation'' that distinguishes $C_2$ from $C_2'$, and show that $C_2'$ already validates a relativized form of this equation.</description>

      <title>From Width-Based Model Checking to Width-Based Automated Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of parameterized complexity theory, the study of graph width measures has been intimately connected with the development of width-based model checking algorithms for combinatorial properties on graphs. In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert a large class of width-based model-checking algorithms into algorithms that can be used to test the validity of graph-theoretic conjectures on classes of graphs of bounded width. Our framework is modular and can be applied with respect to several well-studied width measures for graphs, including treewidth and cliquewidth.
  As a quantitative application of our framework, we prove analytically that for several long-standing graph-theoretic conjectures, there exists an algorithm that takes a number $k$ as input and correctly determines in time double-exponential in $k^{O(1)}$ whether the conjecture is valid on all graphs of treewidth at most $k$. These upper bounds, which may be regarded as upper-bounds on the size of proofs/disproofs for these conjectures on the class of graphs of treewidth at most $k$, improve significantly on theoretical upper bounds obtained using previously available techniques.</description>
