      <title>Constraints on Interstellar Sovereignty</title>

Abstract: Human space exploration and settlement of other planets is becoming increasingly technologically feasible, while mission concepts for remote and crewed missions to nearby star systems continue to be developed. But the long-term success of space settlement also requires extensions and advances in models of governance. This paper provides a synthesis of the physical factors that will constrain the application of sovereignty in space as well as legal precedent on Earth that likely applies to any crewed or uncrewed missions to other stellar systems. The Outer Space Treaty limits the territorial expansion of states into space, but the requirements for oversight of nongovernmental agencies and retention of property ownership enable the extension of state jurisdiction into space. Pragmatic constraints from historical precedent on Earth suggest that new space treaties will be unlikely to succeed and new global space agencies may have limited jurisdiction over states, while hard constraints of the space environment require adherence to technical capabilities, political feasibility, and long-term sustainability. These factors form a three-prong test for assessing the viability of interstellar governance models. This discussion of interstellar governance is intended to further the conversation about sovereignty in space prior to the first intentional launch of any interstellar spacecraft.</description>
