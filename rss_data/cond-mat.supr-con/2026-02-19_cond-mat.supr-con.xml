      <title>Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15998v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Rashba and Ising Spin-Singlet Pairings in Two-Dimensional IrTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry offers a useful approach to unfold the intertwined degrees of freedom. Thus it paves the way to resolve coexisting quantum orders into distinct symmetry sectors. Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in nano-flaked IrTe$_2$, we investigate the superconductivity in strain-stabilized two-dimensional (2D) limit of IrTe$_2$ by combining density-functional theory with mean-field solution of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction on a symmetry-constrained ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ model. The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $\Gamma$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Josephson coupling and thermal quenching of the Josephson diode effect in bilayer superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16242v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.</description>

      <title>Current Induced Switching of Superconducting Order and Enhancement of Superconducting Diode Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Equation for Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the analytical properties and the efficient numerical solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equation for unconventional superconductivity incorporating long-range power-law electron-electron interactions within a tight-binding model on a $d$-dimensional lattice. It is a nonlinear convolution equation for the complex matrix-valued superconducting gap under symmetry constraints imposed by the fermionic anticommutation rules. The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum. This needs to be accounted when evaluating the convolution. After a brief overview of some of the equation's analytical properties, we discuss its efficient numerical solution using a Galerkin method with B-splines. We present numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice.</description>

      <title>Large critical current density Josephson $\pi$ junctions with PdNi barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report large $\pi$-state critical current densities, $J_c(\pi)$, in Nb/Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$/Nb Josephson junctions at Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ thicknesses near the first $\pi$-state. We observe oscillations in the critical current with ferromagnetic barrier thickness consistent with a $0$-$\pi$ transition. For a junction with a 9.4~nm Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ barrier, we obtain $J_c(\pi) = 410~\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 4.2~K, exceeding values reported in prior PdNi-based studies. Magnetization measurements on continuous films, together with coercivity tests on patterned arrays, confirm that Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, enabling zero-field operation without magnetic initialization. The combination of large $J_c(\pi)$ and intrinsic anisotropy establishes Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ as a promising barrier material for passive $\pi$-shifters in superconducting digital logic and qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekul\'e ordering in moir\'e graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekul\'e modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Resonating Valence Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been known to have resonating valence bond (RVB) ground states on certain corner-sharing simplex lattices. Examples include both the quasi-1D sawtooth lattice with open boundary and a larger class of higher dimensional lattices without boundaries. The two types of results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. In the second class of lattices, the simplest simplex is a tetrahedron. We hereby generalize both results by studying the singly hole-doped system on the quasi-1D lattice of a tetrahedron chain, which can be considered a stripe of the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattices. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</description>
