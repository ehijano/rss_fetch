      <title>A Refutation of the Pach-Tardos Conjecture for 0-1 Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of forbidden 0-1 matrices generalizes Turan-style (bipartite) subgraph avoidance, Davenport-Schinzel theory, and Zarankiewicz-type problems, and has been influential in many areas, such as discrete and computational geometry, the analysis of self-adjusting data structures, and the development of the graph parameter twin width.
  The foremost open problems in this area is to resolve the Pach-Tardos conjecture from 2005, which states that if a forbidden pattern $P\in\{0,1\}^{k\times l}$ is the bipartite incidence matrix of an acyclic graph (forest), then $\mathrm{Ex}(P,n) = O(n\log^{C_P} n)$, where $C_P$ is a constant depending only on $P$. This conjecture has been confirmed on many small patterns, specifically all $P$ with weight at most 5, and all but two with weight 6.
  The main result of this paper is a clean refutation of the Pach-Tardos conjecture. Specifically, we prove that $\mathrm{Ex}(S_0,n),\mathrm{Ex}(S_1,n) \geq n2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$, where $S_0,S_1$ are the outstanding weight-6 patterns. We also prove sharp bounds on the entire class of alternating patterns $(P_t)$, specifically that for every $t\geq 2$, $\mathrm{Ex}(P_t,n)=\Theta(n(\log n/\log\log n)^t)$. This is the first proof of an asymptotically sharp bound that is $\omega(n\log n)$.</description>

      <title>A new heuristic approach for contextuality degree estimates and its four- to six-qubit portrayals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe a new heuristic method for finding an upper bound on the degree of contextuality and the corresponding unsatisfied part of a quantum contextual configuration with three-element contexts (i.e., lines) located in a multi-qubit symplectic polar space of order two. While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The four-qubit unsatisfied configurations we found are quite remarkable. That of an elliptic quadric features 315 lines and has in its core three copies of the split Cayley hexagon of order two having a Heawood-graph-underpinned geometry in common. That of a hyperbolic quadric also has 315 lines but, as a point-line incidence structure, is isomorphic to the dual $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ of $\mathcal{W}(5,2)$. Finally, an unsatisfied configuration with 1575 lines associated with all the lines/contexts of the four-qubit space contains a distinguished $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ centered on a point-plane incidence graph of PG$(3,2)$. The corresponding configurations found in the five-qubit space exhibit a considerably higher degree of complexity, except for a hyperbolic quadric, whose 6975 unsatisfied contexts are compactified around the point-hyperplane incidence graph of PG$(4,2)$. The most remarkable unsatisfied patterns discovered in the six-qubit space are a couple of disjoint split Cayley hexagons (for the full space) and a subgeometry underpinned by the complete bipartite graph $K_{7,7}$ (for a hyperbolic quadric).</description>

      <title>Competing for the most profitable tour: The orienteering interdiction game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orienteering problem is a well-studied and fundamental problem in transportation science. In the problem, we are given a graph with prizes on the nodes and lengths on the edges, together with a budget on the overall tour length. The goal is to find a tour that respects the length budget and maximizes the collected prizes. In this work, we introduce the orienteering interdiction game, in which a competitor (the leader) tries to minimize the total prize that the follower can collect within a feasible tour. To this end, the leader interdicts some of the nodes so that the follower cannot collect their prizes. The resulting interdiction game is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, and a single-level reformulation is obtained based on interdiction cuts. A branch-and-cut algorithm with several enhancements, including the use of a solution pool, a cut pool and a heuristic method for the follower's problem, is proposed. In addition to this exact approach, a genetic algorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions in a short computing time. In a computational study based on instances from the literature for the orienteering problem, the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic components is assessed, and the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms are compared in terms of solution time and quality.</description>

      <title>Tree-layout based graph classes: proper chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many standard graph classes are known to be characterized by means of layouts (a permutation of its vertices) excluding some patterns. Important such graph classes are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal graphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a proper interval graph if and only if $G$ has a layout $L$ such that for every triple of vertices such that $x\prec_L y\prec_L z$, if $xz\in E$, then $xy\in E$ and $yz\in E$. Such a triple $x$, $y$, $z$ is called an indifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as indifference layouts.
  In this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout $T_G=(T,r,\rho_G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a tree $T$ rooted at some node $r$ and equipped with a one-to-one mapping $\rho_G$ between $V$ and the nodes of $T$ such that for every edge $xy\in E$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$ is an ancestor of $x$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts.
  Excluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a pattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph classes can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a proof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in tree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize proper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of chordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal graphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex. Based on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm for proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism between two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be GI-complete on chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>A first efficient algorithm for enumerating all the extreme points of a bisubmodular polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently enumerating all the extreme points of a polytope identified by a system of linear inequalities is a well-known challenge issue.We consider a special case and present an algorithm that enumerates all the extreme points of a bisubmodular polyhedron in $\mathcal{O}(n^4|V|)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space complexity, where $ n$ is the dimension of underlying space and $V$ is the set of outputs. We use the reverse search and signed poset linked to extreme points to avoid the redundant search. Our algorithm is a generalization of enumerating all the extreme points of a base polyhedron which comprises some combinatorial enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Small unsatisfiable $k$-CNFs with bounded literal occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the smallest unsatisfiable formulas in subclasses of $k$-CNF (exactly $k$ distinct literals per clause) with bounded variable or literal occurrences. Smaller unsatisfiable formulas of this type translate into stronger inapproximability results for MaxSAT in the considered formula class. Our results cover subclasses of 3-CNF and 4-CNF; in all subclasses of 3-CNF we considered we were able to determine the smallest size of an unsatisfiable formula; in the case of 4-CNF with at most 5 occurrences per variable we decreased the size of the smallest known unsatisfiable formula. Our methods combine theoretical arguments and symmetry-breaking exhaustive search based on SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS), a recent framework for isomorph-free SAT-based graph generation. To this end, and as a standalone result of independent interest, we show how to encode formulas as graphs efficiently for SMS.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>
