      <title>The palette index of the Cartesian product of paths, cycles and regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The palette of a vertex v in a graph G is the set of colors assigned to the edges incident to v. The palette index of G is the minimum number of distinct palettes among the vertices, taken over all proper edge colorings of G. This paper presents results on the palette index of the Cartesian product $G \Box H$, where one of the factor graphs is a path or a cycle. Additionally, it provides exact results and bounds on the palette index of the Cartesian product of two graphs, where one factor graph is isomorphic to a regular or class 1 nearly regular graph.</description>

      <title>Chip-Firing on Infinite $k$-ary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an infinite $k$-ary tree with a self-loop at the root as our underlying graph. We consider a chip-firing process starting with $N$ chips at the root. We describe the stable configurations. We calculate the number of fires for each vertex and the total number of fires. We study a sequence of the number of root fires for a given $k$ as a function of $N$ and study its properties. We do the same for the total number of fires.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial simplicial cone decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algebraic combinatorial approach to simplicial cone decompositions, a key step in solving inhomogeneous linear Diophantine systems and counting lattice points in polytopes. We use constant term manipulation on the system \( A\alpha = \mathbf{b} \), where \( A \) is an \( r \times n \) integral matrix and \( \mathbf{b} \) is an integral vector. We establish a relationship between special constant terms and shifted simplicial cones. This leads to the \texttt{SimpCone[S]} algorithm, which efficiently decomposes polyhedra into simplicial cones. Unlike traditional geometric triangulation methods, this algorithm is versatile for many choices of the strategy \( \texttt{S} \) and can also be applied to parametric polyhedra. The algorithm is useful for efficient volume computation of polytopes and can be applied to address various new research projects. Additionally, we apply our framework to unimodular cone decompositions. This extends the effectiveness of the newly developed \texttt{DecDenu} algorithm from denumerant cones to general simplicial cones.</description>

      <title>A note on the maximum diversity of intersecting families of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S}_n$ be the symmetric group on the set $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subset \mathcal{S}_n$ is called intersecting if for every $\sigma,\pi\in \mathcal{F}$ there exists some $i\in [n]$ such that $\sigma(i)=\pi(i)$. Deza and Frankl proved that the largest intersecting family of permutations is the full star, that is, the collection of all permutations with a fixed position. The diversity of an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the minimum number of permutations in $\mathcal{F}$, which deletion results in a star. In the present paper, by applying the spread approximation method developed recently by Kupavskii and Zakharov, we prove that for $n\geq 500$ the diversity of an intersecting subfamily of $\mathcal{S}_n$ is at most $(n-3)(n-3)!$, which is best possible.</description>

      <title>The Rainbow Saturation Number of Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-coloring of a graph $H$ is a function $\mathcal{C}: E(H) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. We say that $H$ is rainbow if all edges of $H$ have different colors. Given a graph $F$, an edge-colored graph $G$ is $F$-rainbow saturated if $G$ does not contain a rainbow copy of $F$, but the addition of any nonedge with any color on it would create a rainbow copy of $F$. The rainbow saturation number $rsat(n,F)$ is the minimum number of edges in an $F$-rainbow saturated graph with order $n$. In this paper we proved several results on cycle rainbow saturation. For $n \geq 5$, we determined the exact value of $rsat(n,C_4)$. For $ n \geq 15$, we proved that $\frac{3}{2}n-\frac{5}{2} \leq rsat(n,C_{5}) \leq 2n-6$. For $r \geq 6$ and $n \geq r+3$, we showed that $ \frac{6}{5}n \leq rsat(n,C_r) \leq 2n+O(r^2)$. Moreover, we establish better lower bound on $C_r$-rainbow saturated graph $G$ while $G$ is rainbow.</description>

      <title>Branching Ratios of Input Trees for Directed Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the branching ratio of the input tree of a node in a finite directed multigraph, prove that it exists for every node, and show that it is equal to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the induced subgraph determined by all upstream nodes. This real eigenvalue exists by the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for non-negative matrices. We motivate our analysis with simple examples, obtain information about the asymptotics for the limit growth of the input tree, and establish other basic properties of the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Strong Ramsey game on two boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong Ramsey game $R(\mathcal{B}, H)$ is a two-player game played on a graph $\mathcal{B}$, referred to as the board, with a target graph $H$. In this game, two players, $P_1$ and $P_2$, alternately claim unclaimed edges of $\mathcal{B}$, starting with $P_1$. The goal is to claim a subgraph isomorphic to $H$, with the first player achieving this declared the winner. A fundamental open question, persisting for over three decades, asks whether there exists a graph $H$ such that in the game $R(K_n, H)$, $P_1$ does not have a winning strategy in a bounded number of moves as $n \to \infty$.
  In this paper, we shift the focus to the variant $R(K_n \sqcup K_n, H)$, introduced by David, Hartarsky, and Tiba, where the board $K_n \sqcup K_n$ consists of two disjoint copies of $K_n$. We prove that there exist infinitely many graphs $H$ such that $P_1$ cannot win in $R(K_n \sqcup K_n, H)$ within a bounded number of moves through a concise proof. This perhaps provides evidence for the existence of examples to the above longstanding open problem.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding space-filling folding curves in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various examples of folding curves in $R^{2}$ have been considered: dragons and other square curves, terdragons and other triangular curves, Peano-Gosper curves based on hexagons. They are self-avoiding. They form coverings of $R^{2}$, by one curve or by a small number of curves, which satisfy the local isomorphism property. They were used to define some fractals. We construct an example with similar properties in $R^{3}$.</description>

      <title>On decycling and forest numbers of Cartesian products of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decycling number $\nabla(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to eliminate all cycles in $G$. The forest number $f(G)$ is the maximum number of vertices that induce a forest in $G$. So $\nabla(G) + f(G) = |V(G)|$. For the Cartesian product $T \,\square\, T'$ of trees $T$ and $T'$ it is proved that $\nabla(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'}) \leq \nabla(T \,\square\, T')$, thus resolving the conjecture of Wang and Wu asserting that $f(T \,\square\, T') \leq f(S_n \,\square\, S_{n'})$. It is shown that $\nabla(T \,\square\, T') \ge |V(T)| - 1$ and the equality cases characterized. For prisms over trees, it is proved that $\nabla(T\,\square\, K_2) = \alpha'(T)$, and for arbitrary graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, it is proved that $\nabla(G_1 \,\square\, G_2) \geq \alpha'(G_1) \alpha'(G_2)$, where $\alpha'$ is the matching number.</description>

      <title>Counting records in a random, non-uniform, permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting permutations of $[n]$ by the number of records, i.e. left-to-right maxima, is a classic problem in combinatorial enumeration. In the first volume of ``The Art of Computer Programming", Donald Knuth demonstrated its relevance for analysis of average case complexity of a basic algorithm for determining a maximum in a linear list of numbers. It is well known that the expected, and likely, number of those records in a {\it uniformly\/} random permutation is asymptotic to $\log n$. Cyril Banderier, Rene Beier, and Kurt Mehlhorn studied the case of a non-uniform random permutation, which is obtained from a generic permutation of $[n]$ by selecting its elements one after another independently with probability $p$, and permuting the selected elements uniformly at random. They proved that $E_n(p)$, the largest expected number of the maxima, is between $\text{const}\sqrt{n/p}$ and $O\bigl(\sqrt{(n/p)\log n}\bigr)$ if $p$ is fixed. For $p\gg 1/n$ and simultaneously $1-p\ge \text{const }n^{-1/2}\log n$, we prove that $E_n(p)$ is exactly of order $(1-p)\sqrt{n/p}$.</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any arc-weighted oriented graph $D=(V(D), A(D),w)$, we write
  ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ to denote the minimum weight of a feedback arc set in $D$. In this paper, we consider upper bounds on ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ for arc-weight oriented graphs $D$ with bounded maximum degrees and directed girth. We obtain such bounds by introducing a new parameter ${\rm fasd}(D)$, which is the maximum integer such that $A(D)$ can be partitioned into ${\rm fasd}(D)$ feedback arc sets. This new parameter seems to be interesting in its own right.
  We obtain several bounds for both ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fasd}(D)$ when $D$ has maximum degree $\Delta(D)\le \Delta$ and directed girth $g(D)\geq g$. In particular, we show that if $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4. We also show that ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ and ${\rm fas}_w(D) \leq \frac{w(D)}{g}$ if $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\geq g$ for $g\in \{3,4,5\}$ and these bounds are tight. However, for $g=10$ the bound ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ does not always hold when $\Delta(D)\leq 3$. Finally we give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large.</description>

      <title>Species of Rota-Baxter algebras by rooted trees, twisted bialgebras and Fock functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental and ubiquitous combinatorial notion, species has attracted sustained interest, generalizing from set-theoretical combinatorial to algebraic combinatorial and beyond. The Rota-Baxter algebra is one of the algebraic structures with broad applications from Renormalization of quantum field theory to integrable systems and multiple zeta values. Its interpretation in terms of monoidal categories has also recently appeared. This paper studies species of Rota-Baxter algebras, making use of the combinatorial construction of free Rota-Baxter algebras in terms of angularly decorated trees and forests. The notion of simple angularly decorated forests is introduced for this purpose and the resulting Rota-Baxter species is shown to be free. Furthermore, a twisted bialgebra structure, as the bialgebra for species, is established on this free Rota-Baxter species. Finally, through the Fock functor, another proof of the bialgebra structure on free Rota-Baxter algebras is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the number of partitions of a natural number with positive odd rank is equal to the number of two-color partitions (red and blue), where the smallest part is even (say $2n$) and all red parts are even and lie within the interval $(2n,4n]$. This led us to derive a new representation for the third order mock theta function $f_3(q)$ and an analogue of the fundamental identity for the smallest part partition function Spt$(n)$, both of which are of significant interest in their own right. We also consider the odd smallest part version of the above two-color partition, whose generating function involves another third order mock theta function $\phi_3(q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negative type inequalities of a metric space are closely tied to embeddability. A result by Gupta, Newman, and Rabinovich implies that if a metric graph $G$ does not contain a theta submetric as an embedding, then $G$ has negative type. We show the converse: if a metric graph $G$ contains a theta, then it does not have negative type.</description>

      <title>$(2,4)$-Colorability of Planar Graphs Excluding $3$-, $4$-, and $6$-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defective $k$-coloring is a coloring on the vertices of a graph using colors $1,2, \dots, k$ such that adjacent vertices may share the same color. A $(d_1,d_2)$-\emph{coloring} of a graph $G$ is a defective $2$-coloring of $G$ such that any vertex colored by color $i$ has at most $d_i$ adjacent vertices of the same color, where $i\in\{1,2\}$. A graph $G$ is said to be $(d_1,d_2)$-\emph{colorable} if it admits a $(d_1,d_2)$-coloring.
  Defective $2$-coloring in planar graphs without $3$-cycles, $4$-cycles, and $6$-cycles has been investigated by Dross and Ochem, as well as Sittitrai and Pimpasalee. They showed that such graphs are $(0,6)$-colorable and $(3,3)$-colorable, respectively. In this paper, we proved that these graphs are also $(2,4)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Bollob\'{a}s-Nikiforov conjecture holds asymptotically almost surely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bollob\'{a}s and Nikiforov (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B. 97 (2007) 859-865) conjectured that for a graph $G$ with $e(G)$ edges and the clique number $\omega(G)$, then $
\lambda_{1}^{2}+\lambda_{2}^{2}\leq 2e(G)\left(1-\frac{1}{\omega(G)}\right), $ where $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ are the largest and the second largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $G$, respectively. In this paper, we prove that for a sequence of random graphs the conjecture holds true with probability tending to one as the number of vertices tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Temperatures of Robin Hood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cumulative Games were introduced by Larsson, Meir, and Zick (2020) to bridge some conceptual and technical gaps between Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) and Economic Game Theory. The partizan ruleset {\sc Robin Hood} is an instance of a Cumulative Game, viz., {\sc Wealth Nim}. It is played on multiple heaps, each associated with a pair of cumulations, interpreted here as wealth. Each player chooses one of the heaps, removes tokens from that heap not exceeding their own wealth, while simultaneously diminishing the other player's wealth by the same amount. In CGT, the {\em temperature} of a {\em disjunctive sum} game component is an estimate of the urgency of moving first in that component. It turns out that most of the positions of {\sc Robin Hood} are {\em hot}. The temperature of {\sc Robin Hood} on a single large heap shows a dichotomy in behavior depending on the ratio of the wealths of the players. Interestingly, this bifurcation is related to Pingala (Fibonacci) sequences and the Golden Ratio $\phi$: when the ratio of the wealths lies in the interval $(\phi^{-1},\phi)$, the temperature increases linearly with the heap size, and otherwise it remains constant, and the mean values has a reciprocal property. It turns out that despite {\sc Robin Hood} displaying high temperatures, playing in the hottest component might be a sub-optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>The wreath matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\leq n$ be positive integers and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ be the set of integers modulo $n$. A conjecture of Baranyai from 1974 asks for a decomposition of $k$-element subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ into particular families of sets called "wreaths". We approach this conjecture from a new algebraic angle by introducing the key object of this paper, the wreath matrix $M$. As our first result, we establish that Baranyai's conjecture is equivalent to the existence of a particular vector in the kernel of $M$. We then employ results from representation theory to study $M$ and its spectrum in detail. In particular, we find all eigenvalues of $M$ and their multiplicities, and identify several families of vectors which lie in the kernel of $M$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\iota_{k}(m,l)$ denote the total number of intervals of length $m$ across all Dyck paths of semilength $k$ such that each interval contains precisely $l$ falls. We give the formula for $\iota_{k}(m,l)$ and show that $\iota_{k}(k,l)=\binom{k}{l}^2$. Motivated by this, we propose two stronger variants of the wreath conjecture due to Baranyai for $n=2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with Rank $|V(G)|/3$ for the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt{\'a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a game in which one keeps flipping a coin until a given finite string of heads and tails occurs. We find the expected number of coin flips to end the game when the ending string consists of at most four maximal runs of heads or tails or alternates between heads and tails. This leads to some summation identities involving certain generalizations of the Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Strengthened upper bound on the third eigenvalue of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n \ge 3$ vertices, whose adjacency matrix has eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \dots \ge \lambda_n$. The problem of bounding $\lambda_k$ in terms of $n$ was first proposed by Hong and was studied by Nikiforov, who demonstrated strong upper and lower bounds for arbitrary $k$. Nikiforov also claimed a strengthened upper bound for $k \ge 3$, namely that $\frac{\lambda_k}{n} &lt; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{k-1}} - \varepsilon_k$ for some positive $\varepsilon_k$, but omitted the proof due to its length. In this paper, we give a proof of this bound for $k = 3$. We achieve this by instead looking at $\lambda_{n-1} + \lambda_n$ and introducing a new graph operation which provides structure to minimising graphs, including $\omega \le 3$ and $\chi \le 4$. Then we reduce the hypothetical worst case to a graph that is $n/2$-regular and invariant under said operation. By considering a series of inequalities on the restricted eigenvector components, we prove that a sequence of graphs with $\frac{\lambda_{n-1} + \lambda_n}{n}$ converging to $-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ cannot exist.</description>

      <title>A generalized Lalanne--Kreweras involution for rectangular and staircase tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give direct bijective proofs of the symmetry of the distributions of the number of ascents and descents over standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a rectangle $(n,n,\dots,n)$ or a truncated staircase $(n,n-1,\dots,n-k+1)$. These can be viewed as instances of the more general symmetry of the distribution of descents over linear extensions of graded posets, for which previous proofs by Stanley and Farley were based on the theory of $P$-partitions and the involution principle, respectively. In the case of two-row rectangles $(n,n)$, our bijection is equivalent to the Lalanne--Kreweras involution on Dyck paths, which bijectively proves the symmetry of the Narayana numbers.
  Our bijections are defined in terms of certain arrow encodings of standard Young tableaux. This setup allows us to construct other statistic-preserving involutions on tableaux of rectangular shape, providing a simple proof of the fact that ascents and descents are equidistributed up to a shift, and proving a conjecture of Sulanke about certain statistics in the case of three rows. Finally, we use our bijections to define a possible notion of rowmotion on standard Young tableaux of rectangular shape, and to give a bijective proof of the symmetry of the number of descents on canon permutations, which have been recently studied as a variation of Stirling and quasi-Stirling permutations.</description>

      <title>Stretching Demi-Bits and Nondeterministic-Secure Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of cryptographic nondeterministic-secure pseudorandomness beyond the point reached by Rudich's original work (Rudich 1997), and apply it to draw new consequences in average-case complexity and proof complexity. Specifically, we show the following:
  *Demi-bit stretch*: Super-bits and demi-bits are variants of cryptographic pseudorandom generators which are secure against nondeterministic statistical tests (Rudich 1997). They were introduced to rule out certain approaches to proving strong complexity lower bounds beyond the limitations set out by the Natural Proofs barrier (Rudich and Razborov 1997). Whether demi-bits are stretchable at all had been an open problem since their introduction. We answer this question affirmatively by showing that: every demi-bit $b:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}^{n+1}$ can be stretched into sublinear many demi-bits $b':\{0,1\}^{n}\to \{0,1\}^{n+n^{c}}$, for every constant $0&lt;c&lt;1$.

      <title>Two Proofs of a Structural Theorem of Decreasing Minimization on Integrally Convex Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper gives two different proofs to a structural theorem of decreasing minimization (lexicographic optimization) on integrally convex sets. The theorem states that the set of decreasingly minimal elements of an integrally convex set can be represented as the intersection of a unit discrete cube and a face of the convex hull of the given integrally convex set. The first proof resorts to the Fenchel-type duality theorem in discrete convex analysis and the second is more elementary using Farkas' lemma.</description>

      <title>A Permutation-Free Length 3 Decimal Check Digit Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three codes he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. Apparently, not even a pair of such disjoint 3-digit codes is known. The code developed herein, has the property that the knowledge of any two digits is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. This fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1694, Gregory and Newton discussed the problem to determine the kissing number of a rigid material ball. This problem and its higher dimensional generalization have been studied by many mathematicians, including Minkowski, van der Waerden, Hadwiger, Swinnerton-Dyer, Watson, Levenshtein, Odlyzko, Sloane and Musin. Recently, Li and Zong introduced and studied the generalized kissing numbers of convex bodies. As a continuation of this project, in this paper we obtain the exact generalized kissing numbers $\kappa_\alpha^*(B^n)$ of the $n$-dimensional balls for $3\le n\le 8$ and $\alpha =2\sqrt{3}-2$. Furthermore, the lattice kissing number of a four-dimensional cross-polytope is determined.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Cones for Finite Type Cluster Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a cluster algebra of finite cluster type. We study the Gr\"obner cone $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{A}}$ parametrizing term orders inducing an initial degeneration of the ideal $I_{\mathcal{A}}$ of relations among the cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ to the ideal generated by products of incompatible cluster variables. We show that for any cluster variable $v$, the weight induced by taking compatibility degrees with $v$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{A}}$. This allows us to construct an explicit circular term order and prove a conjecture of Ilten, N\'ajera Ch\'avez, and Treffinger. Furthermore, we give explicit descriptions of the rays and lineality spaces of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{A}}$ in terms of combinatorial models for cluster algebras of types $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ with a special choice of frozen variables, and in the case of no frozen variables.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals and their asymptotic syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph, and let $I(G)$ denote its edge ideal. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the syzygies of powers of edge ideals through the lens of homological shift ideals $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$. We introduce the notion of the $i$th homological strong persistence property for monomial ideals $I$, providing an algebraic characterization that ensures the chain of inclusions $\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^2)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^3) \subseteq\cdots$. We prove that edge ideals possess both the 0th and 1st homological strong persistence properties. To this end, we explicitly describe the first homological shift algebra of $I(G)$ and show that $\text{HS}_1(I(G)^{k+1}) = I(G) \cdot \text{HS}_1(I(G)^k)$ for all $k \ge 1$. Finally, we conjecture that if $I(G)$ has a linear resolution, then $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$ also has a linear resolution for all $k \gg 0$, and we present partial results supporting this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Monk Algebras and Representability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ``Monk Algebras and Ramsey Theory,'' \emph{J. Log. Algebr. Methods Program.} (2022), Kramer and Maddux prove various representability results in furtherance of the goal of finding the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra. They also pose many open problems.
  In the present paper, we address problems and issues raised by Kramer and Maddux. In particular, we prove that their Proposition 7 does not generalize, and we answer Problem 1.1 in the negative: relation algebra $1311_{1316}$ is not representable. Thus $1311_{1316}$ is a good candidate for the smallest weakly representable but not representable relation algebra.
  Finally, we give the first known finite cyclic group representations for relation algebras $31_{37}$, $32_{65}$, $1306_{1314}$, and $1314_{1316}$.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a locally finite Borel graph with quasitransitive amenable components admits a fractional perfect matching, it will admit a Borel fractional perfect matching. In particular, if a countable amenable quasitransitive graph admits a fractional perfect matching then its Bernoulli graph admits a Borel fractional perfect matching.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the class of 3D-grids is cannot be transduced from planar graphs, and more generally, from any class of graphs of bounded Euler genus.

      <title>A combinatorial bound on the number of distinct eigenvalues of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The smallest possible number of distinct eigenvalues of a graph $G$, denoted by $q(G)$, has a combinatorial bound in terms of unique shortest paths in the graph. In particular, $q(G)$ is bounded below by $k$, where $k$ is the number of vertices of a unique shortest path joining any pair of vertices in $G$. Thus, if $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$, then $n-q(G)$ is bounded above by the size of the complement (with respect to the vertex set of $G$) of the vertex set of the longest unique shortest path joining any pair of vertices of $G$. The purpose of this paper is to commence the study of the minor-monotone floor of $n-k$, which is the minimum of $n-k$ among all graphs of which $G$ is a minor. Accordingly, we prove some results about this minor-monotone floor.</description>

      <title>New strategy for providing the existence of spanning trees without small degree stems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $k\geq 2$, a spanning tree of a graph without vertices of degree from $2$ to $k$ is called a {\it $[2,k]$-ST} of the graph. The concept of $[2,k]$-STs is a natural extension of a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (or HIST), which is a well-studied graph structure. In this paper, we give a new strategy for finding $[2,k]$-STs. By using the strategy, we refine or extend a known degree-sum condition for the existence of a HIST. Furthermore, we also investigate a degree-product condition for the existence of a $[2,k]$-ST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05940v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $(m,n)$-multiplihedron is a polytope whose faces correspond to $m$-painted $n$-trees, and whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the rotation lattice on binary $m$-painted $n$-trees. Deleting certain inequalities from the facet description of the $(m,n)$-multiplihedron, we construct the $(m,n)$-Hochschild polytope whose faces correspond to $m$-lighted $n$-shades, and whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the rotation lattice on unary $m$-lighted $n$-shades. Moreover, there is a natural shadow map from $m$-painted $n$-trees to $m$-lighted $n$-shades, which turns out to define a meet semilattice morphism of rotation lattices. In particular, when $m=1$, our Hochschild polytope is a deformed permutahedron whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the Hochschild lattice.</description>

Abstract: We consider the avoidance of patterns in inversion sequences that relate sorting via sorting machines including data structures such as pop stacks and stacks. Such machines have been studied under a variety of additional constraints and generalizations, some of which we apply here. We give the classification of several classes of sortable inversion sequences in terms of pattern avoidance. We are able to provide an exact enumeration of some of the sortable classes in question using both classical approaches and a more recent strategy utilizing generating trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cluster complex on one hand, parking functions on the other hand, are two combinatorial (po)sets that can be associated to a finite real reflection group. Cluster parking functions are obtained by taking an appropriate fiber product (over noncrossing partitions). There is a natural structure of simplicial complex on these objects, and our main goal is to show that it has the homotopy type of a (pure) wedge of spheres. The unique nonzero homology group (as a representation of the underlying reflection group) is a sign-twisted parking representation, which is the same as Gordon's quotient of diagonal coinvariants. Along the way, we prove some properties of the poset of parking functions. We also provide a long list of remaining open problems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new type of operad-like structure called a P-operad, which depends on the choice of some collection of posets P, and which is governed by chains in posets of P. We introduce several examples of such structures which are related to classical poset theoretic notions such as poset homology, Cohen--Macaulayness and lexicographic shellability. We then show that P-operads form a satisfactory framework to categorify Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices and their kernel. In particular, this leads to a new proof of the positivity of the coefficients of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of geometric lattices.</description>

      <title>A Toric Analogue for Greene's Rational Function of a Poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite poset, Greene introduced a rational function obtained by summing certain rational functions over the linear extensions of the poset. This function has interesting interpretations, and for certain families of posets, it simplifies surprisingly. In particular, Greene evaluated this rational function for strongly planar posets in his work on the Murnaghan-Nakayama formula.
  In 2012, Develin, Macauley, and Reiner introduced toric posets, which combinatorially are equivalence classes of posets (or rather acyclic quivers) under the operation of flipping maximum elements into minimum elements and vice versa. In this work, we introduce a toric analogue of Greene's rational function for toric posets, and study its properties. In addition, we use toric posets to show that the Kleiss-Kuijf relations, which appear in scattering amplitudes, are equivalent to a specific instance of Greene's evaluation of his rational function for strongly planar posets. Also in this work, we give an algorithm for finding the set of toric total extensions of a toric poset.</description>

Abstract: A regular-graph design is a block design for which a pair $\{a,b\}$ of distinct points occurs in $\lambda+1$ or $\lambda$ blocks depending on whether $\{a,b\}$ is or is not an edge of a given $\delta$-regular graph. Our paper describes a specific construction for regular-graph designs with $\lambda = 1$ and block size $\delta + 1$. We show that for $\delta \in \{2,3\}$, certain necessary conditions for the existence of such a design with $n$ points are sufficient, with two exceptions in each case and two possible exceptions when $\delta = 3$. We also construct designs of orders 105 and 117 for connected 4-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On the theory of Lucas coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of "$Lucas-Coloring$" associated with a planar graph $g$. When $g$ is a $4$-regular, the enumeration of $Lucas-Coloring$ has an interesting interpretation. Specifically, it yields a numerical invariant of the associated Khovanov-Lee complex of any link diagram $D$ whose projection is equal to $g$. This complex resides in the Karoubi envelope of Bar-Natan's formal cobordism category, $Cob^{3}_{/l}$ . The Karoubi envelope of $Cob^{3}_{/l}$ was introduced by Bar-Natan and Morrison to provide a conceptual proof of Lee's theorem. As an application of "Lucas-Coloring", we first show how the Alternating Sign Matrices can be retrieved as a special case of $Lucas-Coloring$. Next, we show a certain statistic on the $Lucas-Coloring$ enumerates the perfect matchings of a canonically defined graph on $g$. This construction allowed us to derive a summation formula of the enumeration of lozenge tilings of the region constructed out of a regular hexagon by removing the "maximal staircase" from its alternating corners in terms of powers of $2$. This formula is reminiscent of the celebrated Aztec Diamond Theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp, which concerns domino tilings of Aztec Diamonds.</description>

      <title>State transfer in discrete-time quantum walks via projected transition matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze state transfer in quantum walks by using combinatorial methods. We generalize perfect state transfer in two-reflection discrete-time quantum walks to a notion that we call 'peak state transfer'; we define peak state transfer as the highest state transfer that can be achieved between an initial and a target state under unitary evolution, even when perfect state transfer is unattainable. We give a spectral characterization of peak state transfer that allows us to fully characterize peak state transfer in the arc-reversal (Grover) walk on various families of graphs, including strongly regular graphs and incidence graphs of block designs (assuming that the walk starts at a point of the design). In addition, we provide many examples of peak state transfer, including an infinite family where the amount of peak state transfer tends to $1$ as the number of vertices grows. We further demonstrate that peak state transfer properties extend to infinite families of graphs generated by vertex blow-ups, and we characterize periodicity in the vertex-face walk on toroidal grids. In our analysis, we make extensive use of the spectral decomposition of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the transition matrix down onto a subspace. Though we are motivated by a problem in quantum computing, we identify several open problems that are purely combinatorial, arising from the spectral conditions required for peak state transfer in discrete-time quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Zarankiewicz problem for bipartite subdivisions with applications to incidence geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a bipartite graph $H$, its linear threshold is the smallest real number $\sigma$ such that every bipartite graph $G = (U \sqcup V, E)$ with unbalanced parts $|V| \gtrsim |U|^\sigma$ and without a copy of $H$ must have a linear number of edges $|E| \lesssim |V|$. We prove that the linear threshold of the complete bipartite subdivision graph $K_{s,t}'$ is at most $\sigma_s = 2 - 1/s$. Moreover, we show that any $\sigma &lt; \sigma_s$ is less than the linear threshold of $K_{s,t}'$ for sufficiently large $t$ (depending on $s$ and $\sigma$).
  Some geometric applications of this result are given: we show that any $n$ points and $n$ lines in the complex plane without an $s$-by-$s$ grid determine $O(n^{4/3 - c})$ incidences for some constant $c &gt; 0$ depending on $s$; and for certain pairs $(p,q)$, we establish nontrivial lower bounds on the number of distinct distances determined by $n$ points in the plane under the condition that every $p$-tuple of points determines at least $q$ distinct distances.</description>

Abstract: We prove a generalization of the topological Tverberg theorem. One special instance of our general theorem is the following: Let $\Delta$ denote the 8-dimensional simplex viewed as an abstract simplicial complex, and suppose that its vertices are arranged in a $3\times 3$ array. Then for any continuous map $f:\Delta \to \mathbb{R}^3$ it is possible to partition the rows or the columns of the vertex array into two parts, such that the disjoint faces $\sigma$ and $\tau$ induced by the two parts satisfy $f(\sigma)\cap f(\tau) \neq \emptyset$. Our result also has consequences for geometric transversals and topological Helly.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Finding Degree-Doubling Nodes in Oriented Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of pseudointegral polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a rational pseudointegral triangle with exactly one lattice point in its interior has at most $9$ lattice points on its boundary, where a polygon $P$ is called pseudointegral if the Ehrhart function of $P$ is a polynomial. We further show that such a triangle never has exactly $7$ lattice points on its boundary. Our results determine the set of all Ehrhart polynomials of rational triangles with one interior lattice point.
  In addition, we construct convex pseudointegral polygons with $i$ interior lattice points and $b$ boundary lattice points for all positive integral values of $(i,b)$ such that $b \le 5i + 4$. This is in contrast to integral polygons, which must satisfy $b \le 2i + 7$ by a result of Scott. Our constructions yield many new Ehrhart polynomials of rational polygons in the $i \ge 2$ case.</description>

Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets and a disjoint pair $A,B$ we let $\mathcal{F}(A,\overline{B})=\{F\in \mathcal{F}: A\subseteq F, ~B\cap F=\emptyset\}$. The \textbf{$(p,q)$-d\"omd\"od\"om} of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is $\beta_{p,q}(\mathcal{F})=\min\{|\mathcal{F}(A,\overline{B})|:|A|=p,|B|=q, A\cap B=\emptyset, A,B\subseteq [n]\} $. This definition encompasses size, diversity, minimum degree, and sturdiness as special cases. We investigate the maximum possible value $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ of $\beta_{p,q}(\mathcal{F})$ over all $k$-uniform intersecting families $\mathcal{F}\subset 2^{[n]}$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ for all fixed $p,q,k$. We relate the asymptotics of $\beta_{p,q}(n,k)$ to the constant value of $\beta_{0,q}(n,q+1)$ and establish $\beta_{p,1}(n,k)=\binom{n-3-p}{k-2-p}$ and $\beta_{p,2}(n,k)=2\binom{n-5}{k-3-p}-\binom{n-7}{k-5-p}$ if $n$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>

      <title>Computational Graph Decompositions I: Oriented Berge-Fulkerson Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berge-Fulkerson conjecture states that every bridgeless cubic graph can be covered with six perfect matchings such that each edge is covered exactly twice. An equivalent reformulation is that it's possible to find a 6-cycle 4-cover. In this paper we discuss the oriented version (o6c4c) of the latter statement, pose it as a conjecture and prove it for the family of Isaacs flower snarks. Similarly to the case of oriented cycle double cover, we can always construct an orientable surface (possibly with boundary) from an o6c4c solution. If the o6c4c solution itself splits into two (not necessarily oriented) cycle double covers, then it's also possible to build another pair of orientable surfaces (also possibly with boundaries). Finally we show how to build a ribbon graph, and for some special o6c4c cases we show that this ribbon graph corresponds to an oriented 6-cycle double cover.

      <title>Dual structures on Coxeter and Artin groups of rank three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups to all rank-three Coxeter systems, beyond the previously studied spherical and affine cases. Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.</description>

      <title>Polarizations of Artin monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any polarization of an Artin monomial ideal defines a triangulated ball. This proves a conjecture of A.Almousa, H.Lohne and the first author.
  Geometrically, polarizations of ideals containing $(x_1^{a_1}, \ldots, x_n^{a_n})$ define full-dimensional triangulated balls on the sphere which is the join of boundaries of simplices of dimensions $a_1-1, \cdots, a_n-1$. Every full-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay sub-complex of this joined sphere is of this kind, and these balls are constructible.
  Such a triangulated ball has a dual cell complex which is a sub-complex of the product of simplices of dimensions $a_1-1, \cdots a_n-1$. The associated cellular complex of this gives the minimal free resolution of the Alexander dual ideal of the triangulated ball. When the product of simplices is a hypercube, in many examples these dual cell complexes enables a classification of the range of polarizations of the Artin monomial ideal.
  We also show that the squeezed balls of G.Kalai \cite{Ka} derive from polarizations of Artin monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>On cycles and merge trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of a merge tree to that of a generalized merge tree, a merge tree that includes 1-dimensional cycle birth information. Given a discrete Morse function on a $1$-dimensional regular CW complex, we construct the induced generalized merge tree. We give several notions of equivalence of discrete Morse functions based on the induced generalized merge tree and how these notions relate to one another. As a consequence, we obtain a complete solution to the inverse problem between discrete Morse functions on $1$-dimensional regular CW complexes and generalized merge trees. After characterizing which generalized merge trees can be induced by a discrete Morse function on a simple graph, we give an algorithm based on the induced generalized merge tree of a discrete Morse function $f\colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ that cancels the critical simplices of $f$ and replaces it with an optimal discrete Morse function.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for Grothendieck constants, quantum correlation matrices and CCP functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the search for the still unknown exact value of the real and complex Grothendieck constant $K_G^\mathbb{F}$ in the famous Grothendieck inequality (unsolved since 1953), where $\mathbb{F}$ denotes either the real or the complex field, we concentrate our search on their smallest upper bound. To this end, we establish a basic framework, built on functions which map correlation matrices to correlation matrices entrywise by means of the Hadamard product, such as the Krivine function in the real case or the Haagerup function in the complex case. By making use of multivariate real and complex Gaussian analysis, higher transcendental functions, integration over spheres and combinatorics of the inversion of Maclaurin series, we provide an approach by which we also recover all famous upper bounds of Grothendieck himself ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \sinh(\pi/2) \approx 2.301$), Krivine ($K_G^\mathbb{R} \leq \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})} \approx 1,782$) and Haagerup ($K_G^\mathbb{C} \leq 1.405$, numerically approximated); each of them as a special case. In doing so, we aim to unify the real and complex case as much as possible and apply our results to several concrete examples, including the Walsh-Hadamard transform (''quantum gate'') and the multivariate Gaussian copula - with foundations of quantum theory and quantum information theory in mind. Moreover, we offer a shortening and a simplification of the proof of the strongest estimation until now; namely that $K_G^\mathbb{R} &lt; \frac{\pi}{2 \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})}$. We summarise our key results in form of an algorithmic scheme and shed light on related open problems and topics for future research.</description>

      <title>Permutation representations and automorphisms of evolution algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the natural permutation representation of highly transitive finite groups cannot be realized as the full automorphism group of an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution algebra acting on the set of lines spanned by its natural elements. Specifically, for any sufficiently large integer $n$ and $k \geq 4$, there does not exist an idempotent evolution algebra $X$ of dimension $n$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is isomorphic to a proper $k$-transitive subgroup of $S_n$.
  Nevertheless, we show that for any finite group $G$, any permutation representation $\xi \colon G \to S_n$, and any field $\Bbbk$, there exists an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution $\Bbbk$-algebra $X$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X) \cong G$, and the induced representation of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ on the natural idempotents of $X$ is equivalent to $\xi$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the normalising graph of a group and study the connectivity of the normalising and permuting graphs of a group when the group is finite and soluble. In particular, we classify finite soluble groups with disconnected normalising graph. The main results shows that if a finite soluble group has connected normalising graph then this graph has diameter at most 6. Furthermore, this bound is tight. A corollary then presents the connectivity properties of the permuting graph.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a reduced complex projective plane curve, and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the first two smallest exponents of $C$. For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$, there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. Finally we give new bounds for the second exponent $d_2$ of a line arrangement $\mathcal A$, the corresponding lower bound being an improvement of a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the maximal exponent of $\mathcal A$ and the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal A$.</description>
