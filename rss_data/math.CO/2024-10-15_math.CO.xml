      <title>The Locating Rainbow Connection Number of the Edge Corona of a Graph with a Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph has a locating rainbow coloring if every pair of its vertices can be connected by a path passing through internal vertices with distinct colors and every vertex generates a unique rainbow code. The minimum number of colors needed for a graph to have a locating rainbow coloring is referred to as the locating rainbow connection number of a graph. Let $G$ and $H$ be two connected, simple, and undirected graphs on disjoint sets of $|V(G)|$ and $|V(H)|$ vertices, $|E(G)|$ and $|E(G)|$ edges, respectively. For $j\in\{1,2,...,|E(G_m)|\}$, the edge corona of $G_m$ and $H_n$, denoted as $G_m \diamond H_n$, is constructed by using a single copy of $G_m$ and $E(G_m)$ copies of $H_n$, and then connecting the two end vertices of the $j$-th edge of $G_m$ to every vertex in the $j$-th copy of $H_n$. In this paper, we determine the upper and lower bounds of the locating rainbow connection number for the class of graphs resulting from the edge corona of a graph with a complete graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these upper and lower bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Spider networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this investigation we study a family of networks, called spiders, which covers a range of networks going from chains to complete graphs. These spiders are characterized by three parameters: the number of nodes in the core, the number of legs at each core node, and the length of these legs. Keeping two of the three parameters constant we investigate if spiders are small worlds in the sense recently defined by Egghe.</description>

      <title>Characterization of polystochastic matrices of order $4$ with zero permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multidimensional nonnegative matrix is called polystochastic if the sum of its entries over each line is equal to $1$. The permanent of a multidimensional matrix is the sum of products of entries over all diagonals. We prove that if $d$ is even, then the permanent of a $d$-dimensional polystochastic matrix of order $4$ is positive, and for odd $d$, we give a complete characterization of $d$-dimensional polystochastic matrices with zero permanent.</description>

      <title>Conjugation on reddening sequences and reddening potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the conjugation of the reddening sequence according to the formula of $c$-vectors with respect to changing of the initial seed. As applications, we extend the Rotation Lemma, the Target before Source Theorem, and the mutation invariant property of the existence of reddening sequences to totally sign-skew-symmetric cluster algebras. Furthermore, this also leads to the construction of reddening potential which characterizes the number of red mutations a maximal green sequence should admit in any matrix pattern with the initial seed changed via mutations.</description>

      <title>On Tur\'an-type problems and the abstract chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, Coregliano and Razborov introduced a general framework to study limits of combinatorial objects, using logic and model theory. They introduced the abstract chromatic number and proved/reproved multiple Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits-type theorems in different settings. In 2022, Coregliano extended this by showing that similar results hold when we count copies of $K_t$ instead of edges.
  Our aim is threefold. First, we provide a purely combinatorial approach. Second, we extend their results by showing several other graph parameters and other settings where Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits-type theorems follow. Third, we go beyond determining asymptotics and obtain corresponding stability, supersaturation, and sometimes even exact results.</description>

      <title>Inverse Fiedler vector problem of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph and one of its weighted Laplacian matrix, a Fiedler vector is an eigenvector with respect to the second smallest eigenvalue. The Fiedler vectors have been used widely for graph partitioning, graph drawing, spectral clustering, and finding the characteristic set. This paper studies how the graph structure can control the possible Fiedler vectors for different weighted Laplacian matrices. For a given tree, we characterize all possible Fiedler vectors among its weighted Laplacian matrix. As an application, the characteristic set can be anywhere on a tree, except for the set containing a single leaf. For a given cycle, we characterize all possible eigenvectors corresponding to the second or the third smallest eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Sequences of odd length in strict partitions I: the combinatorics of double sum Rogers-Ramanujan type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strict partitions are enumerated with respect to the weight, the number of parts, and the number of sequences of odd length. We write this trivariate generating function as a double sum $q$-series. Equipped with such a combinatorial set-up, we investigate a handful of double sum identities appeared in recent works of Cao-Wang, Wang-Wang, Wei-Yu-Ruan, Andrews-Uncu, Chern, and Wang, finding partition theoretical interpretations to all of these identities, and in most cases supplying Franklin-type involutive proofs. This approach dates back more than a century to P. A. MacMahon's interpretations of the celebrated Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and has been further developed by Kur\c{s}ung\"{o}z in the last decade.</description>

      <title>A new criterion for oriented graphs to be determined by their generalized skew spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral characterizations of graphs is an important topic in spectral graph theory which has been studied extensively by researchers in recent years. The study of oriented graphs, however, has received less attention so far. In Qiu et al.~\cite{QWW} (Linear Algebra Appl. 622 (2021) 316-332), the authors gave an arithmetic criterion for an oriented graph to be determined by its \emph{generalized skew spectrum} (DGSS for short). More precisely, let $\Sigma$ be an $n$-vertex oriented graph with skew adjacency matrix $S$ and $W(\Sigma)=[e,Se,\ldots,S^{n-1}e]$ be the \emph{walk-matrix} of $\Sigma$, where $e$ is the all-one vector. A theorem of Qiu et al.~\cite{QWW} shows that a self-converse oriented graph $\Sigma$ is DGSS, provided that the Smith normal form of $W(\Sigma)$ is ${\rm diag}(1,\ldots,1,2,\ldots,2,2d)$, where $d$ is an odd and square-free integer and the number of $1$'s appeared in the diagonal is precisely $\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$. In this paper, we show that the above square-freeness assumptions on $d$ can actually be removed, which significantly improves upon the above theorem. Our new ingredient is a key intermediate result, which is of independent interest: for a self-converse oriented graphs $\Sigma$ and an odd prime $p$, if the rank of $W(\Sigma)$ is $n-1$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, then the kernel of $W(\Sigma)^{\rm T}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is \emph{anisotropic}, i.e., $v^{\rm T}v\neq 0$ for any $0\ne v\in{{\rm ker}\,W(\Sigma)^{\rm T}}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>On Positive and Negative $r$-th Power Energy of Graphs with Edge Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the positive and negative $r$-th power energy of graphs and their behavior under edge addition. Specifically, we extend the classical notions of positive and negative square energies to the $r$-th power energies, denoted as $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$, respectively. We derive improved bounds for $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$ under edge addition, which provide a sharper result in terms of the order compared to those of Abiad et al. Additionally, we address the problem of monotonicity of the positive $r$-th power energy when adding a new edge to the graph, providing counterexamples for the case $1 \leq r &lt; 3$ and thereby disproving a conjecture of Guo.</description>

      <title>Annihilating polynomial, Jordan canonical from, and generalized spectral characterizations of Eulerian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an Eulerian graph on $n$ vertices with adjacency matrix $A$ and characteristic polynomial $\phi(x)$. We show that when $n$ is even (resp. odd), the square-root of $\phi(x)$ (resp. $x\phi(x)$) is an annihilating polynomial of $A$, over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The result was achieved by applying the Jordan canonical form of $A$ over the algebraic closure $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2$. Based on this, we show a family of Eulerian graphs are determined by their generalized spectrum among all Eulerian graphs, which significantly simplifies and strengthens the previous result.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the graphs with dominating parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ is a \textit{dominating set} of $G$ if every vertex in $V(G)-S$ has a neighbor in $S$. The \textit{domination number} \(\gamma(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of $G$. A dominating set $S$ is a \textit{total dominating set} if $N(S)$=$V$ where $N(S)$ is the neighbor of $S$. The \textit{total domination number} \(\gamma_t(G)\) equals the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of $G$. A set $D$ is an \textit{isolate set} if the induced subgragh $G[D]$ has at least one isolated vertex. The \textit{isolate number} \(i_0(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a maximal isolate set. In this paper we study these parameters and answer open problems proposed by Hamid et al. in 2016.</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $\ell$ of Catalan/Semiorder-Type [5pt] Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By establishing a labeled Dyck path model for the regions of \(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}\) and \(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*\), this paper explores several enumerative problems related to the number of regions of level \(\ell\), denoted as \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\), which includes: \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)] proving a Stirling convolution relation between \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\), refining a result by Stanley and Postnikov;
  \item[(2)] showing that the sequences $\left(r_\ell{(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(r_\ell {(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)})_{n\geq 0}$ exhibit properties of binomial type in the sense of Rota;
  \item[(3)] establishing the transformational significance of \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\) under Stanley's ESA framework: they can be viewed as transition matrices from binomial coefficients to their characteristic polynomials respectively. \end{enumerate} Further, we present two applications of the theories and methods: first, inspired by a question from Deshpande, Menon, and Sarkar, we provide a hyperplane arrangement counting interpretation of the two-parameter generalization of Fuss--Catalan numbers, which is closely related to the number of regions of level \(\ell\) in the \(m\)-Catalan arrangement. Second, using labeled Dyck paths to depict the number of regions in the \(m\)-Catalan arrangement, we algorithmically provide the inverse mapping of the Fu, Wang, and Zhu mapping.</description>

      <title>Entropy and the growth rate of universal covering trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the relation between two graph parameters, $\rho$ and $\Lambda$. For an undirected graph $G$, $\rho(G)$ is the growth rate of its universal covering tree, while $\Lambda(G)$ is a weighted geometric average of the vertex degree minus one, corresponding to the rate of entropy growth for the non-backtracking random walk (NBRW). It is well known that $\rho(G) \geq \Lambda(G)$ for all graphs, and that graphs with $\rho=\Lambda$ exhibit some special properties. In this work we derive an easy to check, necessary and sufficient condition for the equality to hold. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the number of random bits used by a length $\ell$ NBRW is $O(1)$ if $\rho = \Lambda$ and $\Omega(\ell)$ if $\rho &gt; \Lambda$. As a consequence we exhibit infinitely many non-trivial examples of graphs with $\rho = \Lambda$.</description>

      <title>On the metric representation of the vertices of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric representation of a vertex $u$ in a connected graph $G$ respect to an ordered vertex subset $W=\{\omega_1, \dots , \omega_n\}\subset V(G)$ is the vector of distances $r(u\vert W)=(d(u,\omega_1), \dots , d(u,\omega_n))$. A vertex subset $W$ is a resolving set of $G$ if $r(u\vert W)\neq r(v\vert W)$, for every $u,v\in V(G)$ with $u\neq v$. Thus, a resolving set with $n$ elements provides a set of metric representation vectors $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ with cardinal equal to the order of the graph. In this paper, we address the reverse point of view, that is, we characterize the finite subsets $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ that are realizable as the set of metric representation vectors of a graph $G$ with respect to some resolving set $W$. We also explore the role that the strong product of paths plays in this context. Moreover, in the case $n=2$, we characterize the sets $S\subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ that are uniquely realizable as the set of metric representation vectors of a graph $G$ with respect to a resolving set $W$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a basis $B$ for its cycle space, where each edge of $G$ belongs to at most $k$ members of $B$. In this note, we show that every non-planar graph that can be embedded on a surface with Euler characteristic $0$ has a basis number of exactly $3$, proving a conjecture of Schmeichel from 1981. Additionally, we show that any graph embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ (whether orientable or non-orientable) of genus $g$ has a basis number of $O(\log^2 g)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local operations of combinatorial structures (graphs, Hadamard matrices, codes, designs) that maintain the basic parameters unaltered, have been widely used in the literature under the name of switching. We show an equivalence between two switching methods to construct inequivalent Hadamard matrices, which were proposed by Orrick [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2008], and the switching method for constructing cospectral graphs which was introduced by Godsil and McKay [Aequationes Mathematicae, 1982].</description>

      <title>On cubic rainbow domination regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $d$-regular graph $X$ is called $d$-rainbow domination regular or $d$-RDR, if its $d$-rainbow domination number $\gamma_{rd}(X)$ attains the lower bound $n/2$ for $d$-regular graphs, where $n$ is the number of vertices. In the paper, two combinatorial constructions to construct new $d$-RDR graphs from existing ones are described and two general criteria for a vertex-transitive $d$-regular graph to be $d$-RDR are proven. A list of vertex-transitive 3-RDR graphs of small orders is produced and their partial classification into families of generalized Petersen graphs, honeycomb-toroidal graphs and a specific family of Cayley graphs is given by investigating the girth and local cycle structure of these graphs.</description>

      <title>Finding an Isomorphism between the Riordan Group and a Subgroup of the Double Riordan Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riordan group is a set of infinite lower-triangular matrices defined by two generating functions, $g$ and $f$. The elements of the group are called Riordan arrays, denoted by $(g,f)$, and the $k$th column of a Riordan array is given by the function $gf^k$. The Double Riordan group is defined similarly using three generating functions $g$, $f_1$, and $f_2$, where $g$ is an even function and $f_1$ and $f_2$ are odd functions. This group generalizes the Checkerboard subgroup of the Riordan group, where $g$ is even and $f$ is odd. An open question posed by Davenport, Shapiro, and Woodson was if there exists an isomorphism between the Riordan group and a subgroup of the Double Riordan group. This question is answered in this article.</description>

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between points of momentum amplituhedra and origami crease patterns. As an application, we prove that the BCFW cells triangulate the momentum amplituhedron when all Mandelstam variables are nonnegative. As another application, we show that every weighted planar bipartite graph $\Gamma$ admits a t-embedding, i.e., an embedding of the planar dual of $\Gamma$ such that the sum of angles of white (equivalently, black) faces around each vertex is equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Invariants of almost embeddings of graphs in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey we motivate studies of the invariants from the title. A graph drawing in the plane is called an almost embedding if the images of any two non-adjacent simplices (i.e. vertices or edges) are disjoint. We introduce integer invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu numbers. We prove some relations between the invariants. We demonstrate connection of these relations to homology of the deleted product of a graph. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these invariants.
  This paper is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area (and to students). All the necessary definitions are recalled. We present some ideas of algebraic and geometric topology in a language accessible to non-topologists. However elementary, this paper is motivated by frontline of research; there are some conjectures and an open problem.</description>

      <title>Separable Drawings: Extendability and Crossing-Free Hamiltonian Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing pseudospherical drawings, we introduce a new class of simple drawings, which we call separable drawings. In a separable drawing, every edge can be closed to a simple curve that intersects each other edge at most once. Curves of different edges might interact arbitrarily. Most notably, we show that (1) every separable drawing of any graph on $n$ vertices in the plane can be extended to a simple drawing of the complete graph $K_{n}$, (2) every separable drawing of $K_{n}$ contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle and is plane Hamiltonian connected, and (3) every generalized convex drawing and every 2-page book drawing is separable. Further, the class of separable drawings is a proper superclass of the union of generalized convex and 2-page book drawings. Hence, our results on plane Hamiltonicity extend recent work on generalized convex drawings by Bergold et al. (SoCG 2024).</description>

Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for computing discrete cubical homology of graphs over a field of characteristic zero. This algorithm improves on several computational steps compared to constructions in the existing literature, with the key insights including: a faster way to generate all singular cubes, reducing the dimensions of vector spaces in the chain complex by taking a quotient over automorphisms of the cube, and preprocessing graphs using the axiomatic treatment of discrete cubical homology.</description>

Abstract: We study a random graph model with preferential edge attachment and detachment through the embedding into a generalized Yule model. We show that the in-degree distribution of a vertex chosen uniformly at random follows a power law in the supercritical regime but has an exponential decay in the subcritical. We provide the corresponding asymptotics. In the critical regime we observe an intermediate decay. The regimes are clearly defined in terms of parameter ranges.</description>

Abstract: We study a new extension formula for right Bol loops. We prove the necessary or sufficient conditions for the extension to be right Bol. We describe the most important invariants: right multiplication group, nuclei, and center. We show that the core is an involutory quandle which is the disjoint union of two isomorphic involutory quandles. We also derive further results on the structure group of the core of the extension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper tackle the problem of computing the ranks of certain eulerian magnitude homology groups of a graph G. First, we analyze the computational cost of our problem and prove that it is #W[1]-complete. Then we develop the first diagonal algorithm, a breadth-first-search-based algorithm parameterized by the diameter of the graph to calculate the ranks of the homology groups of interest. To do this, we leverage the close relationship between the combinatorics of the homology boundary map and the substructures appearing in the graph. We then discuss the feasibility of the presented algorithm and consider future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Polymatroid Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "matroid Schubert variety". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
  We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modelled by a "polymatroid Schubert variety".
  Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on matroid Schubert varieties; however, the geometry of polymatroid Schubert varieties is noticeably more complicated than that of matroid Schubert varieties. Many natural questions remain open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial cubes are graphs that can be isometrically embedded into hypercubes. Convex cycles play an important role in the study of partial cubes. In this paper, we prove that a regular partial cube is a hypercube (resp., a Doubled Odd graph, an even cycle of length $2n$ where $n\geqslant 4$) if and only if all its convex cycles are 4-cycles (resp., 6-cycles, $2n$-cycles). In particular, the partial cubes whose all convex cycles are 4-cycles are equivalent to almost-median graphs. Therefore, we conclude that regular almost-median graphs are exactly hypercubes, which generalizes the result by Mulder [J. Graph Theory, 4 (1980) 107--110] -- regular median graphs are hypercubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with four or more vertices is called bicritical if the removal of any pair of distinct vertices of $G$ results in a graph with a perfect matching. A bicritical graph is minimal if the deletion of each edge results in a non-bicritical graph. Recently, Y. Zhang et al. and F. Lin et al. respectively showed that bicritical graphs without removable edges and minimal bricks have at least four cubic vertices. In this note, we show that minimal bicritical graphs also have at least four cubic vertices, so confirming O. Favaron and M. Shi's conjecture in the case of $k=2$ on minimal $k$-factor critical graphs.</description>

Abstract: The anti-Ramsey number $\mathrm{ar}(n,F)$ of an $r$-graph $F$ is the minimum number of colors needed to color the complete $n$-vertex $r$-graph to ensure the existence of a rainbow copy of $F$. We establish a removal-type result for the anti-Ramsey problem of $F$ when $F$ is the expansion of a hypergraph with a smaller uniformity. We present two applications of this result. First, we refine the general bound $\mathrm{ar}(n,F) = \mathrm{ex}(n,F_{-}) + o(n^r)$ proved by Erd{\H o}s--Simonovits--S{\' o}s, where $F_{-}$ denotes the family of $r$-graphs obtained from $F$ by removing one edge. Second, we determine the exact value of $\mathrm{ar}(n,F)$ for large $n$ in cases where $F$ is the expansion of a specific class of graphs. This extends results of Erd{\H o}s--Simonovits--S{\' o}s on complete graphs to the realm of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Order-2 Delaunay Triangulations Optimize Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local angle property of the (order-$1$) Delaunay triangulations of a generic set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ asserts that the sum of two angles opposite a common edge is less than $\pi$. This paper extends this property to higher order and uses it to generalize two classic properties from order-$1$ to order-$2$: (1) among the complete level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation lexicographically maximizes the sorted angle vector; (2) among the maximal level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation is the only one that has the local angle property. We also use our method of establishing (2) to give a new short proof of the angle vector optimality for the (order-1) Delaunay triangulation. For order-$1$, both properties have been instrumental in numerous applications of Delaunay triangulations, and we expect that their generalization will make order-$2$ Delaunay triangulations more attractive to applications as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factorization structures occur in toric differential and discrete geometry, and can be viewed in multiple ways, e.g., as objects determining substantial classes of explicit toric Sasaki and K\"ahler geometries, as special coordinates on such, or as an apex generalisation of cyclic polytopes featuring a generalised Gale's evenness condition. This article presents a comprehensive study of factorization structures. It establishes their structure theory and introduces their use in the geometry of cones and polytopes. The article explains the construction of polytopes and cones compatible with a given factorization structure, and exemplifies it for product Segre-Veronese and Veronese factorization structures, where the latter case includes cyclic polytopes. Further, it derives the generalised Gale's evenness condition for compatible cones, polytopes and their duals, and explicitly describes faces of these. Factorization structures naturally provide generalised Vandermonde identities, which relate normals of any compatible polytope, and which are used for Veronese factorization structure to find examples of Delzant and rational Delzant compatible polytopes. The article offers a myriad of factorization structure examples, which are later characterised to be precisely factorization structures with decomposable curves, and raises the question if these encompass all factorization structures, i.e., the existence of an indecomposable factorization curve.</description>

      <title>Toward a density Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal theorem for degenerate hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $r$-graph $F$ with $r \ge 2$, let $\mathrm{ex}(n, (t+1) F)$ denote the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-graph with at most $t$ pairwise vertex-disjoint copies of $F$. Extending several old results and complementing prior work [J. Hou, H. Li, X. Liu, L.-T. Yuan, and Y. Zhang. A step towards a general density Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal theorem. arXiv:2302.09849, 2023.] on nondegenerate hypergraphs, we initiate a systematic study on $\mathrm{ex}(n, (t+1) F)$ for degenerate hypergraphs $F$. For a broad class of degenerate hypergraphs $F$, we present near-optimal upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}(n, (t+1) F)$ when $n$ is sufficiently large and $t$ lies in intervals $\left[0, \frac{\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm{ex}(n,F)}{n^{r-1}}\right]$, $\left[\frac{\mathrm{ex}(n,F)}{\varepsilon n^{r-1}}, \varepsilon n \right]$, and $\left[ (1-\varepsilon)\frac{n}{v(F)}, \frac{n}{v(F)} \right]$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is a constant depending only on $F$. Our results reveal very different structures for extremal constructions across the three intervals, and we provide characterizations of extremal constructions within the first interval. Additionally, for graphs, we offer a characterization of extremal constructions within the second interval. Our proof for the first interval also applies to a special class of nondegenerate hypergraphs, including those with undetermined Tur\'{a}n densities, partially improving a result in [J. Hou, H. Li, X. Liu, L.-T. Yuan, and Y. Zhang. A step towards a general density Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal theorem. arXiv:2302.09849, 2023.]</description>

      <title>The minimum degree of minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graphs*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ of order $n$ is said to be $k$-factor-critical for integers $1\leq k&lt; n$, if the removal of any $k$ vertices results in a graph with a perfect matching. A $k$-factor-critical graph is minimal if for every edge, the deletion of it results in a graph that is not $k$-factor-critical. In 1998, O. Favaron and M. Shi conjectured that every minimal $k$-factor-critical graph has minimum degree $k+1$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graphs. Moreover, we show that every minimal $k$-factor-critical claw-free graph $G$ has at least $\frac{k-1}{2k}|V(G)|$ vertices of degree $k+1$ in the case of $(k+1)$-connected, yielding further evidence for S. Norine and R. Thomas' conjecture on the minimum degree of minimal bricks when $k=2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the operator $A = u(z)\frac{d}{dz}$ is considered, where $u$ is an entire or meromorphic function in the complex plane. The expansion of $A^{k}$ ($k\geq1$) with the help of the powers of the differential operator $D=\frac{d}{dz}$ is obtained, and it is shown that this expansion depends on special numbers. Connections between these numbers and known combinatorial numbers are given. Some special cases of the operator $A$, corresponding to $u(z) = z$, $u(z) = e^{z}$, $u(z) = \frac{1}{z}$, are considered.</description>

      <title>On an $n$-ary generalization of the Lie representation and tree Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study, initiated in our prior work with Richard Stanley, of the representation of the symmetric group on the multilinear component of an $n$-ary generalization of the free Lie algebra known as the free Filippov $n$-algebra with $k$ brackets. Our ultimate aim is to determine the multiplicities of the irreducible representations in this representation. This had been done for the ordinary Lie representation ($n=2$ case) by Kraskiewicz and Weyman. The $k=2$ case was handled in our prior work, where the representation was shown to be isomorphic to $S^{2^{n-1}1}$. In this paper, for general $n$ and $k$, we obtain decomposition results that enable us to determine the multiplicities in the $k=3$ and $k=4$ cases. In particular we prove that in the $k=3$ case, the representation is isomorphic to $S^{3^{n-1}1} \oplus S^{3^{n-2}21^2}$. Our main result shows that the multiplicities stabilize in a certain sense when $n$ exceeds $k$. As an important tool in proving this, we present two types of generalizations of the notion of Specht module that involve trees.</description>

      <title>Ore-type conditions for existence of a jellyfish in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Dirac's Theorem states that for each $n\geq 3$ every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq n/2$ has a hamiltonian cycle. When $\delta(G)&lt; n/2$, this cannot be guaranteed, but the existence of some other specific subgraphs can be provided. Gargano, Hell, Stacho and Vaccaro proved that every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-1)/3$ contains a spanning {\em spider}, i.e., a spanning tree with at most one vertex of degree at least $3$. Later, Chen, Ferrara, Hu, Jacobson and Liu proved the stronger (and exact) result that for $n\geq 56$ every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-2)/3$ contains a spanning {\em broom}, i.e., a spanning spider obtained by joining the center of a star to an endpoint of a path. They also showed that a $2$-connected graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-2)/3$ and some additional properties contains a spanning {\em jellyfish} which is a graph obtained by gluing the center of a star to a vertex in a cycle disjoint from that star. Note that every spanning jellyfish contains a spanning broom.
  The goal of this paper is to prove an exact Ore-type bound which guarantees the existence of a spanning jellyfish: We prove that if $G$ is a $2$-connected graph on $n$ vertices such that every non-adjacent pair of vertices $(u,v)$ satisfies $d(u) + d(v) \geq \frac{2n-3}{3}$, then $G$ has a spanning jellyfish. As corollaries, we obtain strengthenings of two results by Chen et al.: a minimum degree condition guaranteeing the existence of a spanning jellyfish, and an Ore-type sufficient condition for the existence of a spanning broom. The corollaries are sharp for infinitely many $n$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a modification of the Hopping Lemma due to Woodall.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and native (real-world) RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive base pairs frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in native RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in native secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

In this paper, we reprove their result using some elementary combinatorial methods. Our proof is different from their proof, and it is based on the connection between the inverse of the multi-variate independence polynomials and the multi-colored chromatic polynomials of graphs, established by Arunkumar et al. in 2018.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of random regular graphs: Chebyshev polynomials, non-backtracking walks, and unitary-color extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts. This result is derived by generalizing a formula of Friedman involving Chebyshev polynomials and non-backtracking walks. We also extend a criterion of Sodin on the convergence of graph spectral measures to regular graphs of growing degree. As a result, we show that for a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, if $q_n = n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, the normalized spectral measure converges almost surely in $p$-Wasserstein distance to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1, \infty)$. This strengthens a result of Dumitriu and Pal. Many of the results are extended to unitary-colored regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study the holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrices on possibly infinite regular graphs. More precisely, we show an expansion of $h(A)$ in terms of non-backtracking matrices, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $h$ is a holomorphic function on the interior of a particular ellipse containing the spectrum of $A$. Furthermore, we prove related trace formulas for regular graphs. Our results provide a simple and direct approach to the study of resolvent, heat and Schr\"odinger equations, Ihara zeta functions, and combinatorial enumeration problems on regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the poset of d-indivisible noncrossing partitions introduced by M\"uhle, Nadeau and Williams. These are noncrossing partitions such that each block has cardinality 1 modulo d and each block of the dual partition also has cardinality 1 modulo d. Generalizing the work of Speicher, we introduce a generating function approach to reach new enumerative results and recover some known formulas on the cardinality, the M\"obius function and the rank numbers. We compute the antipode of the Hopf algebra of d-indivisible noncrossing partition posets. Generalizing work of Stanley, we give an edge labeling such that the labels of the maximal chains are exactly the d-parking functions. This edge labeling induces an EL-labeling. We also introduce d-parking trees which are in bijective correspondence with the maximal chains.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of the cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 1,2,4,6$. For non-cyclic finite nilpotent groups, we show that the oriented diameter of corresponding power graphs is at least $3$. Moreover, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the oriented diameter of $2$-edge connected power graphs of finite non-cyclic nilpotent groups to be either $3$ or $4$. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Compression with wildcards: All induced metric subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by applications in the natural, social and computer sciences several algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all sets $X\s V$ of vertices of a graph $G=(V,E)$ that induce a {\it connected} subgraph. We offer two algorithms for enumerating all $X$'s that induce (more exquisite) {\it metric} subgraphs. Specifically, the first algorithm, called {\tt AllMetricSets}, generates these $X$'s in a compressed format. The second algorithm generates all (accessible) metric sets one-by-one but is provably output-polynomial. Mutatis mutandis the same holds for the convex sets $X\s V$, where "convex" is a natural strengthening of "metric". The Mathematica command {\tt BooleanConvert} features prominently.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for Gowers norms on discrete cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal dimensionless inequalities $$ \|f\|_{U^k} \leq \|f\|_{\ell^{p_{k,n}}} $$ that hold for all functions $f\colon\mathbb{Z}^d\to\mathbb{C}$ supported in $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^d$ and estimates $$ \|1_A\|_{U^k}^{2^k}\leq |A|^{t_{k,n}} $$ that hold for all subsets $A$ of the same discrete cubes. A general theory, analogous to the work of de Dios Pont, Greenfeld, Ivanisvili, and Madrid, is developed to show that the critical exponents are related by $p_{k,n} t_{k,n} = 2^k$. This is used to prove the three main results of the paper: an explicit formula for $t_{k,2}$, which generalizes a theorem by Kane and Tao, two-sided asymptotic estimates for $t_{k,n}$ as $n\to\infty$ for a fixed $k\geq2$, which generalize a theorem by Shao, and a precise asymptotic formula for $t_{k,n}$ as $k\to\infty$ for a fixed $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Proper rainbow saturation for trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if: (1) There is a proper edge colouring of $G$ containing no rainbow copy of $H$; (2) For every $e \notin E(G)$, every proper edge colouring of $G+e$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$. The proper rainbow saturation number $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in a properly rainbow $H$-saturated graph. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the proper rainbow saturation number for trees. We obtain exact and asymptotic results on $\text{sat}^*(n,T)$ for several infinite families of trees. Our proofs reveal connections to the classical saturation and semi-saturation numbers.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if: (1) There is a proper edge colouring of $G$ containing no rainbow copy of $H$; (2) For every $e \notin E(G)$, every proper edge colouring of $G+e$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$. The proper rainbow saturation number $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in a properly rainbow $H$-saturated graph. In this paper we use connections to the classical saturation and semi-saturation numbers to provide new upper bounds on $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ for general cliques, cycles, and complete bipartite graphs. We also provide some general lower bounds on $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ and explore several other interesting directions.</description>

      <title>The embedding of line graphs associated to the annihilator graph of commutative rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The annihilator graph $AG(R)$ of the commutative ring $R$ is an undirected graph with vertex set as the set of all non-zero zero divisors of $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $ann(xy) \neq ann(x) \cup ann(y)$. In this paper, we study the embedding of the line graph of $AG(R)$ into orientable or non-orientable surfaces. We completely characterize all the finite commutative rings such that the line graph of $AG(R)$ is of genus or crosscap at most two. We also obtain the inner vertex number of $L(AG(R))$. Finally, we classify all the finite rings such that the book thickness of $L(AG(R))$ is at most four.</description>

Abstract: Permutations are usually enumerated by size, but new results can be found by enumerating them by inversions instead, in which case one must restrict one's attention to indecomposable permutations. In the style of the seminal paper by Simion and Schmidt, we investigate all combinations of permutation patterns of length at most 3.</description>

      <title>A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods and supertree methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <title>Embeddings of $k$-complexes in $2k$-manifolds and minimum rank of partial symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06636v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex having $n$ faces of dimension $k$, and $M$ a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-dimensional manifold. We prove that for $k\ge3$ odd $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if there are
  $\bullet$ a skew-symmetric $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with $\mathbb Z$-entries whose rank over $\mathbb Q$ does not exceed $rk H_k(M;\mathbb Z)$,
  $\bullet$ a general position PL map $f:K\to\mathbb R^{2k}$, and
  $\bullet$ orientations on $k$-faces of $K$ such that for any nonadjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$ of $K$ the element $A_{\sigma,\tau}$ equals to the algebraic intersection of $f\sigma$ and $f\tau$.
  We prove some analogues of this result including those for $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability. Our results generalize the Bikeev-Fulek-Kyn\v cl criteria for the $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability of graphs to surfaces, and are related to the Harris-Krushkal-Johnson-Pat\'ak-Tancer criteria for the embeddability of $k$-complexes into $2k$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements Satisfy (un)Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems, Applications to $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a reduced hyperplane arrangement we prove the analytic Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, subject to mild combinatorial arithmetic conditions on the weights defining the twist. This gives a quasi-isomorphism between the twisted logarithmic de Rham complex and the twisted meromorphic de Rham complex. The latter computes the cohomology of the arrangement's complement with coefficients from the corresponding rank one local system. We also prove the algebraic variant (when the arrangement is central), and the analytic and algebraic (untwisted) Logarithmic Comparison Theorems. The last item positively resolves an old conjecture of Terao. We also prove that: every nontrivial rank one local system on the complement can be computed via these Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems; these computations are explicit finite dimensional linear algebra. Finally, we give some $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-module applications: for example, we give a sharp restriction on the codimension one components of the multivariate Bernstein--Sato ideal attached to an arbitrary factorization of an arrangement. The bound corresponds to (and, in the univariate case, gives an independent proof of) M. Saito's result that the roots of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a non-smooth, central, reduced arrangement live in $(-2 + 1/d, 0).$</description>

      <title>Critical classes of power graphs and reconstruction of directed power graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph $\Gamma=(V,E)$, we consider the common closed neighbourhood of a subset of vertices and use this notion to introduce a Moore closure operator in $V.$ We also consider the closed twin equivalence relation in which two vertices are equivalent if they have the same closed neighbourhood. Those notions are deeply explored when $\Gamma$ is the power graph associated with a finite group $G$. In that case, among the corresponding closed twin equivalence classes, we introduce the concepts of plain, compound and critical classes. The study of critical classes, together with properties of the Moore closure operator, allow us to correct a mistake in the proof of {\rm \cite[Theorem 2 ]{Cameron_2}} and to deduce a simple algorithm to reconstruct the directed power graph of a finite group from its undirected counterpart, as asked in \cite[Question 2]{GraphsOnGroups}.</description>

      <title>A complete classification of shuffle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $k$ and $n$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ is generated by the $k!$ permutations of a deck of $kn$ cards performed by cutting the deck into $k$ piles with $n$ cards in each pile, and then perfectly interleaving these cards following a certain permutation of the $k$ piles. For $k=2$, the shuffle group $G_{2,2n}$ was determined by Diaconis, Graham and Kantor in 1983. The Shuffle Group Conjecture states that, for general $k$, the shuffle group $G_{k,kn}$ contains $\mathrm{A}_{kn}$ whenever $k\notin\{2,4\}$ and $n$ is not a power of $k$. In particular, the conjecture in the case $k=3$ was posed by Medvedoff and Morrison in 1987. The only values of $k$ for which the Shuffle Group Conjecture has been confirmed so far are powers of $2$, due to recent work of Amarra, Morgan and Praeger based on Classification of Finite Simple Groups. In this paper, we confirm the Shuffle Group Conjecture for all cases using results on $2$-transitive groups and elements of large fixed point ratio in primitive groups.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Nonlinear Input-Output Systems to Zero the Output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an input-output system where the output is the tracking error given some desired reference signal. It is natural to consider under what conditions the problem has an exact solution, that is, the tracking error is exactly the zero function. If the system has a well defined relative degree and the zero function is in the range of the input-output map, then it is well known that the system is locally left invertible, and thus, the problem has a unique exact solution. A system will fail to have relative degree when more than one exact solution exists. The general goal of this paper is to describe a decomposition of an input-output system having a Chen-Fliess series representation into a parallel product of subsystems in order to identify possible solutions to the problem of zeroing the output. For computational purposes, the focus is on systems whose generating series are polynomials. It is shown that the shuffle algebra on the set of generating polynomials is a unique factorization domain so that any polynomial can be uniquely factored modulo a permutation into its irreducible elements for the purpose of identifying the subsystems in a parallel product decomposition. This is achieved using the fact that this shuffle algebra is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra over the vector space spanned by Lyndon words. A specific algorithm for factoring generating polynomials into its irreducible factors is presented based on the Chen-Fox-Lyndon factorization of words.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Holographic Entropy Cone via Cycle Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Introduction to graph theory and basic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book collects the lectures about graph theory and its applications which were given to students of mathematical departments of Moscow State University and Peking University. Graph theory is a very wide field with a lot of applications in almost every scientific area: in many branches of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and also in psychology, arts, philosophy and many others. Nowadays, graph theory becomes especially more important because of the rapid development of molecular biology, neural networks and AI fields. One of the aims of writing this book was to give students thorough knowledge about graphs to understand modern scientific fields more deeply. Here we tried to give classical and modern theorems and algorithms in more understandable and simple way. We spent many time to rewrite them and close the gaps in several simplest well-known proofs to provide more precise and accurate material for students.</description>

      <title>Recognition Complexity of Subgraphs of k-Connected Planar Cubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recognition complexity of subgraphs of k-connected planar cubic graphs for k = 1, 2, 3. We present polynomial-time algorithms to recognize subgraphs of 1- and 2-connected planar cubic graphs, both in the variable and fixed embedding setting. The main tools involve the Generalized (Anti)factor-problem for the fixed embedding case, and SPQR-trees for the variable embedding case. Secondly, we prove NP-hardness of recognizing subgraphs of 3-connected planar cubic graphs in the variable embedding setting.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ is a Borel set of Hausdorff dimension $\dim A&gt;1$, and if $\rho_{\theta}$ is orthogonal projection to the line spanned by $( \cos \theta, \sin \theta, 1 )$, then $\rho_{\theta}(A)$ has positive length for all $\theta$ outside a set of Hausdorff dimension at most $\frac{3-\dim A}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Affine groups as flag-transitive and point-primitive automorphism groups of symmetric designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate symmetric designs admitting a flag-transitive and point-primitive affine automorphism group. We prove that if an automorphism group $G$ of a symmetric $(v,k,\lambda)$ design with $\lambda$ prime is point-primitive of affine type, then $G=2^{6}{:}\mathrm{S}_{6}$ and $(v,k,\lambda)=(16,6,2)$, or $G$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$ for some odd prime power $q$. In conclusion, we present a classification of flag-transitive and point-primitive symmetric designs with $\lambda$ prime, which says that such an incidence structure is a projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$, it has parameter set $(15,7,3)$, $(7, 4, 2)$, $(11, 5, 2)$, $(11, 6, 2)$, $(16,6,2)$ or $(45, 12, 3)$, or $v=p^d$ where $p$ is an odd prime and the automorphism group is a subgroup of $\mathrm{A\Gamma L}_{1}(q)$.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>The exact quantum chromatic number of Hadamard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact value of the quantum chromatic numbers of Hadamard graphs of order $n=2^N$ for $N$ a multiple of $4$ using the upper bound derived by Avis, Hasegawa, Kikuchi, and Sasaki, as well as an application of the Hoffman-like lower bound of Elphick and Wocjan that was generalized by Ganesan for quantum graphs. As opposed to prior computations for the lower bound, our approach uses Ito's results on conjugacy class graphs allowing us to also find bounds on the quantum chromatic numbers of products of Hadamard graphs. In particular, we also compute the exact quantum chromatic number of the categorical product of Hadamard graphs.</description>

      <title>Primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $n$ is $0$ or $4$ modulo $6$. We show that there are infinitely many primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$ with both $p$ and $q$ prime, and obtain an asymptotic for their number. In particular, when $n = 4$ we verify the `Gaussian primes conjecture' of Friedlander and Iwaniec.
  We study the problem using the method of Type I/II sums in the number field $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-n})$. The main innovation is in the treatment of the Type II sums, where we make heavy use of two recent developments in the theory of Gowers norms in additive combinatorics: quantitative versions of so-called concatenation theorems, due to Kuca and to Kuca--Kravitz-Leng, and the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah and the second author.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture about Ron Graham's Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ron Graham's Sequence is a surprising bijection from non-negative integers to non-negative, non-prime integers that was introduced by Ron Graham in the June 1986 "Problems" column of $\textit{Mathematics Magazine}$, and which later appeared in Problem A2 of the 2013 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. We describe some properties of this function, give an algorithm for computing its values in pseudo-polynomial time, and prove a 22 year-old conjecture about an upper bound for the function.</description>

      <title>A study of nil Hecke algebras via Hopf algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebroids are generalizations of Hopf algebras to less commutative settings. We show how the comultiplication defined by Kostant and Kumar turns the affine nil Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter system into a Hopf algebroid without an antipode. The proof relies on mixed dihedral braid relations between Demazure operators and simple reflections. For researchers new to Hopf algebroids we include additional examples from ring theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.</description>
