      <title>Revisit of discrete energy bands in Galilean moon's footprint tails: remote signals of particle absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Juno spacecraft during its transit over flux tubes of the Galilean moons have identified sharp enhancements of particle fluxes at discrete energies. These banded structures have been suspected to originate from a bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfven waves generated by the moon-magnetospheric interaction. Here, we show that predictions from the above hypothesis are inconsistent with the observations, and propose an alternative interpretation that the banded structures are remote signals of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a particle would encounter the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of bounce cycles it experiences within a fixed section of drift motion determined by moon-spacecraft longitudinal separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are expected to appear at discrete, equally-spaced velocities consistent with the observations. This finding improves our understanding of moon-plasma interactions and provides a potential way to evaluate the Jovian magnetospheric models.</description>

      <title>The possible dual nature of the asteroid (12499) 1998 FR47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the R-band lightcurves of the Flora family asteroid (12499) 1998 FR47, obtained in 2022 at two different astronomical sites: Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (MPC Code 071) and Astronomical Station Vidojevica (MPC Code C89). The quadramodal lightcurves reveal a rotation period of 6.172+/-0.003 h and an amplitude of about 0.44 mag. Using the lightcurve inversion method, with the combination of our dense lightcurves and the sparse data from Gaia DR3, we found the sidereal period, an indication of a retrograde rotation of (12499) and its low-convex resolution shape. Nonetheless, the unusual shape of the quadramodal lightcurve and its additional analysis reveals two possible periods, 3.0834+/-0.0085 h and 4.1245+/-0.0151 h, making the suspect that the asteroid might be a non-synchronised wide binary system. Spectral analysis of the asteroid using data from the GAIA DR3 shows that it is either an M- or an L-type object and maybe a piece of the first planetesimals to form in the Solar System protoplanetary disk. On the other hand, (12499)'s dynamical properties indicate a significantly shorter lifetime. The asteroid lies exactly on the chaotic border of the 7:4 mean motion resonance with Mars (7M:4), alternating between being in and out of it for almost 190 Myrs. During 200 Myrs of integration, (12499) visited other resonances in the Flora family, but it never became a Near Earth Object (NEO). Additional integration of fictive objects from the 7M:4 resonance showed a possibility of transportation to the NEO region already at about 20 Myrs.</description>

      <title>Light Echoes of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light echoes offer a means of studying protoplanetary disks, including their geometry and composition, even when they are not spatially resolved. We present a test of this approach applied specifically to optically thick, geometrically flared disks around active stars. Here we adopt stellar parameters of an active M dwarf to calculate light echoes for disks and rings with radii that would produce time delays consistent with TESS short cadence (about 2 minutes) time bins. Our results show successful fits to disk parameters, highlighting the potential effectiveness of this method in the search for protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Clouds and Hazes in the Atmospheres of Triton and Pluto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds and hazes are abundant in the thin and cold atmospheres of Triton and Pluto, where they are thought to be produced by interactions between atmospheric gases and ultraviolet photons from the Sun and those scattered by the local interstellar medium. These interactions lead to a rich network of chemical reactions that produces higher order hydrocarbons and nitriles that condense out to form ice clouds, and ultimately complex haze particles that rain down onto the surface that impact the atmospheric thermal structure, gas chemistry, and surface evolution. In this chapter, we will review the observational evidence for clouds and hazes in the atmospheres of Triton and Pluto and theoretical interpretations thereof, and the emerging set of experiments aiming to produce Triton and Pluto clouds and hazes in the lab to learn about them in detail.</description>

      <title>Analyses of Multiple Balmer Emission Lines from Accreting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planetary growth rate, a.k.a., the mass accretion rate, is a fundamental parameter in planet formation, as it determines a planet's final mass. Planetary mass accretion rates have been estimated using hydrogen lines, based on the models originally developed for accreting stars, known as the accretion flow model. Recently, Aoyama et al. (2018) introduced the accretion shock model as an alternative mechanism for hydrogen line emission. However, it remains unclear which model is more appropriate for accreting planets and substellar objects. To address this, we applied both models to archival data consisting of 96 data points from 76 accreting brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars, with masses ranging from approximately 0.02 to 0.1 $M_\sun$, to test which model best explains their accreting properties. The results showed that the emission mechanisms of 15 data points are best explained by the shock model, while 55 data points are best explained by the flow model. For the 15 data points explained by the planetary shock model, the shock model estimates up to several times higher mass accretion rates than the flow model. As this trend is more pronounced for planetary mass objects, it is crucial to determine which emission mechanism is dominant in individual planets. We also discuss the physical parameters that determine the emission mechanisms and the variability of line ratios.</description>

      <title>Characterising the molecular line emission in the asymmetric Oph-IRS 48 dust trap: Temperatures, timescales, and sub-thermal excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing physical and chemical processes in planet-forming disks set the stage for planet formation. The asymmetric disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 has one of the most well-characterised chemical inventories, showing molecular emission from a wide variety of species at the dust trap. One of the explanations for the asymmetric structure is dust trapping by a perturbation-induced vortex. We aim to constrain the excitation properties of the molecular species SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We further characterise the extent of the molecular emission, through the determination of important physical and chemical timescales at the location of the dust trap. We also investigate whether the potential vortex can influence the observable temperature structure of the gas. Through a pixel-by-pixel rotational diagram analysis, we create rotational temperature and column density maps for SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH, while temperature maps for H$_2$CO are created using line ratios. We find temperatures of $T\sim$55 K and $T\sim$125 K for SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH, respectively, while the line ratios point towards temperatures of T$\sim$150-300 K for H$_2$CO. The rotational diagram of CH$_3$OH is dominated by scatter and subsequent non-LTE RADEX calculations suggest that both CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO must be sub-thermally excited. The temperatures suggest that SO$_2$ comes from a layer deep in the disk, while CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO originate from a higher layer. While a potential radial gradient is seen in the temperature map of SO$_2$, we do not find any hints of a vortex influencing the temperature structure. The determined turbulent mixing timescale is not able to explain the emitting heights of the molecules, but the photodissociation timescales are able to explain the wider azimuthal extents of SO$_2$ and H$_2$CO compared to CH$_3$OH, where a secondary, gas-phase formation reservoir is required for H$_2$CO.</description>

      <title>Developing a Non-Newtonian Fluid Model for Dust, for Application to Astrophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the astrophysics community it is common practice to model collisionless dust, entrained in a gas flow, as a pressureless fluid. However a pressureless fluid is fundamentally different from a collisionless fluid - the latter of which generically possess a non-zero anisotropic pressure or stress tensor. In this paper we derive a fluid model for collisionless dust, entrained in a turbulent gas, starting from the equations describing the motion of individual dust grains. We adopt a covariant formulation of our model to allow for the geometry and coordinate systems prevalent in astrophysics, and provide a closure valid for the accretion disc context. We show that the continuum mechanics properties of a dust fluid corresponds to a higher-dimensional anisotropic Maxwell fluid, after the extra dimensions are averaged out, with a dynamically important rheological stress tensor. This higher-dimensional treatment has the advantage of keeping the dust velocity and velocity of the fluid seen, and their respective moments, on the same footing. This results in a simplification of the constitutive relation describing the evolution of the dust Rheological stress.</description>

      <title>Irradiated Atmospheres I: Heating by Vertical-Mixing Induced Energy Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have revealed unique temperature profiles in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We propose that the energy transport by vertical mixing could lead to such thermal features. In our new scenario, strong absorbers, TiO and VO are not necessary. Vertical mixing could be naturally excited by atmospheric circulation or internal gravity wave breaking. We perform radiative transfer calculations by taking into account the vertical mixing driven energy transport. The radiative equilibrium (RE) is replaced by radiative-mixing equilibrium (RME). We investigate how the mixing strength, $K_{\rm zz}$, affects the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile. Strong mixing can heat the lower atmosphere and cool the upper atmosphere. This effect has important effects on the atmosphere thermal features that would form without mixing. In certain circumstances, it can induce temperature inversions in scenarios where the temperature monotonically increases with increasing pressure under conditions of lower thermal band opacity. Temperature inversions show up as $K_{\rm zz}$ increases with altitude due to shear interaction with the convection layer. The atmospheric thermal structure of HD~209458b can be well fitted with $K_{\rm zz} \propto (P/1\ {\rm bar})^{-1/2}\ {\rm cm}^{2} \ {\rm s}^{-1}$. Our findings suggest vertical mixing promotes temperature inversions and lowers $K_{\rm zz}$ estimates compared to prior studies. Incorporating chemical species into vertical mixing will significantly affect the thermal profile due to their temperature sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Dust Traffic Jams in Polar-Aligning Circumbinary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misaligned circumbinary disks will produce dust traffic jams during alignment or anti-alignment to the binary orbital plane. We conduct a hydrodynamical simulation of an initially misaligned circumbinary disk undergoing polar alignment with multiple dust species. Due to differential precession between the gas and dust components, multiple dust traffic jams are produced within the disk during polar alignment. The radial locations of the dust traffic jams depend on the Stokes number of the grains, which depends on grain size. We compute the dust temperature structure using post-processing radiative transfer to produce continuum images at cm-wavelengths. Multiple distinct rings emerge in the continuum images, corresponding to the dust traffic jams. The angular resolution of upcoming observations from SKA and ngVLA will be sufficient to detect centimeter-sized grains in protoplanetary disks and resolve the widths of dust traffic jams. Therefore, dust traffic jams resulting from the differential precession of gas and dust in misaligned circumbinary disks will be a prime target for more extended wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Planet-planet scattering in systems of multiple planets of unequal mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large sample of planet-planet scattering events for three planet systems with different orbital separations and masses is analyzed with a multiple regression model. The dependence of the time for the onset of instability on the masses of the planets and on their initial orbital separations is modeled with a quadratic function. The same analysis is applied to the timespan of the chaotic evolution dominated by mutual close encounters. The configurations with the less massive planet on an outside orbit are stable over longer timescales. The same configuration leads to shorter chaotic evolution times before the ejection of one planet. In about 70\% of the cases the lighter planet is the one escaping from the system. If a different separation is assumed between the inner and outer planet pairs, then the dominant effect on the instability time is due to the pair with the smaller separation, as a first approximation.</description>

      <title>The pale blue dot: using the Planetary Spectrum Generator to simulate signals from hyper realistic exo-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres and surfaces of planets show tremendous amount of spatial variation, which has a direct effect on the spectrum of the object, even if this may not be spatially resolved. Here, we apply hyper realistic radiative simulations of Earth as an exoplanet comprising thousands of simulations and study the unresolved spectrum. The GlobES module on the Planetary Spectrum Generator was used, and we parameterized the atmosphere as described in the modern earth retrospective analysis for research and applications, MERRA2, database. The simulations were made into high spatial resolution images and compared to space based observations from the DSCOVR EPIC, at L1, and Himawari8, geostationary, satellites, confirming spatial variations and the spectral intensities of the simulations. The DSCOVR EPIC camera only functions in narrow wavelength bands, but strong agreement is demonstrated. It is shown that aerosols and small particles play an important role in defining Earths reflectance spectra, contributing significantly to its characteristic blue color. Subsequently, a comprehensive noise model is employed to constrain the exposure time required to detect O2, O3 and H2O as a function of varying ground and cloud cover for several concept observatories, including the habitable worlds observatory. Cloud coverage enhances the detectability of planets in reflected light, with important consequences for the design of the future HWO. The HWO concept would require between 3 to 10 times longer to observe the studied features than LUVOIR A but performs better than the HabEx without a starshade. The codes, routines, and the noise models are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous planet masses I: Reanalysis of archival HARPS radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical exoplanet mass-radius relations have been used to study the demographics and compositions of small exoplanets for many years. However, the heterogeneous nature of these measurements hinders robust statistical analysis of this population, particularly with regard to the masses of planets. For this reason, we perform a homogeneous and consistent re-analysis of the radial velocity (RV) observations of 85 small exoplanets using publicly available HARPS RV data and the fitting toolkit Pyaneti. For the entire sample, we run 12 different models to investigate the impact of modelling choices, including the use of multi-dimensional Gaussian Processes (GPs) to mitigate stellar activity. We find that the way orbital eccentricity is modelled can significantly impact the RV amplitude found in some cases. We also find that the addition of a GP to mitigate stellar activity does impact the RV amplitude found - though if the GP is modelled on activity indicators as well as the RVs the results are more robust. The RV amplitude found for every planet in our sample using all the models is made available for other groups to perform demographics studies. Finally, we provide a list of recommendations for the RV community moving forward.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the monograph, the authors systematize and generalize the results of studying solar-type activity that is characteristic of a significant part of mid- and low-mass stars of the Galaxy, outline the characteristics of such stars in the quiescent state, during the sporadic flares and variations of magnetic activity over the course of stellar evolution. The observational data taken over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum from decametric radio waves to X-rays are described in detail. The current models of stellar flares and stellar dynamo models are considered in two theoretical chapters. The last part of the book describes the impact of stellar activity of mid- and low-mass stars on exoplanetary environments. The Catalog of Stars with Solar-Type Activity is provided in the supplementary section.
  The book is intended for researchers involved in studying the physics of stars and the Sun, graduate students, and students specialized in heliophysics, astrophysics, and in the field of space physics.
  The cover shows the distribution of 314618 stars with solar-type activity over the celestial sphere.</description>

Abstract: The radiation chemistry and physics of solid N2O have been increasingly studied due to its potential presence on the surfaces of cold, outer Solar System bodies. However, to date, no study has investigated systematically the influence of temperature on this chemistry and physics. In this present study, crystalline N2O ices were irradiated using 2 keV electrons at five different temperatures in the 20-60 K range and the radiolytic dissociation of the molecular solid (as well as the radiolytic formation of seven product molecules) was quantified through the G-value. Our results indicate that temperature does indeed play a role in the radiolytic destruction of crystalline N2O, with higher temperatures being associated with higher destruction G-values. The formation G-values of NO, NO2, N2O2, N2O3, N2O4, N2O5, and O3 were also noted to vary with temperature, with each product molecule exhibiting a distinct trend. The applications of our experimental results to further understanding solid-phase radiation chemistry in the outer Solar System are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cascade adaptive optics with a second stage based on a Zernike wavefront sensor for exoplanet observations</title>

Abstract: For the past decade, the high-contrast observation of disks and gas giant planets around nearby stars has been made possible on ground-based instruments using extreme adaptive optics (XAO). While these facilities produce images with a Strehl ratio larger than 90% in H-band in median observing conditions and high-flux regime, the correction leaves AO residuals which prevent the study of fainter or less massive exoplanets. Cascade AO systems with a fast second stage based on a Pyramid wavefront sensor have recently emerged as an appealing solution to reduce the atmospheric wavefront errors. Since these aberrations are expected to be small, they can also be accurately measured by a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), a well-known concept for its high sensitivity and moderate linear capture range. We propose an alternative second stage relying on the ZWFS to correct for the AO residuals. The cascade AO with a ZWFS-based control loop is implemented on the ESO's GHOST testbed to validate the scheme in monochromatic light. In median wind speed and seeing, our second-stage AO with a ZWFS and a basic integrator reduce the atmospheric residuals by a factor of 6 and increase the wavefront error stability with a gain of 2 from open to closed loop. In the presence of non common path aberrations, we also reach a contrast gain by a factor of 2 in the images with a Lyot coronagraph at short separations from the source, proving the ability of our scheme to work in cascade with an XAO loop and help imaging fainter or lighter close-in companions. In more challenging conditions, contrast improvements are also achieved by adjusting the control loop features. Our study validates the ZWFS-based second-stage AO loop as an effective solution to address small residuals left from a single-stage XAO system for the coronagraphic observations of circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Controlled Partial Gravity Platform for Milligravity in Drop Tower Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail a platform for partial g environment and an experiment for simulated impacts on asteroid surfaces based on it. The partial g environment is created by a two stage approach: First, create microgravity using the ZARM drop tower. Second, convert microgravity to partial gravity by steady acceleration of experiment volume on linear drive inside microgravity environment. The experiment we conducted on this platform simulates low-velocity impacts into a simulated asteroid surface. To recreate the asteroid environment, in addition to the partial gravity, a vacuum chamber is used. We explain requirements, setup and operation of partial gravity platform and experiment and discuss its performance. Finally, we are open for requests for external experiments which might benefit from our platform with $9.3\,$s of controlled partial gravity down to the mm/s$^2$ range with low g-jitter.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey of Moon-Forming Giant Impacts. II. Rotating bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the leading theory of lunar formation, known as the giant impact hypothesis, a collision between two planet-size objects resulted in a young Earth surrounded by a circumplanetary debris disk from which the Moon later accreted. The range of giant impacts that could conceivably explain the Earth-Moon system is limited by the set of known physical and geochemical constraints. However, while several distinct Moon-forming impact scenarios have been proposed -- from small, high-velocity impactors to low-velocity mergers between equal-mass objects -- none of these scenarios have been successful at explaining the full set of known constraints, especially without invoking one or more controversial post-impact processes. Allowing for pre-impact rotation of the colliding bodies has been suggested as an avenue which may produce more promising collision outcomes. However, to date, only limited studies of pre-impact rotation have been conducted. Therefore, in the second paper of this series, we focus on pairwise impacts between rotating bodies. Using non-rotating collisions as a baseline, we systematically study the effects of rotation on collision outcomes. We consider nine distinct rotation configurations and a range of rotation rates up to the rotational stability limit. Notably, we identify a population of collisions that can produce low post-impact angular momentum budgets and massive, iron-poor protolunar disks. Furthermore, even when pre-impact rotation is included, we demonstrate that the canonical Moon-forming impact can only generate sufficiently massive protolunar disks in the presence of excessive post-impact angular momentum budgets; this casts doubt on the canonical impact scenario.</description>

      <title>Reliable Detections of Atmospheres on Rocky Exoplanets with Photometric JWST Phase Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04386</link>

Abstract: The distribution of different types of atmospheres and surfaces on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing the detection of atmospheres. One technique is to measure day-side emission to search for lower thermal emission than expected for a black-body planet due to atmospheric absorption features. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. In this work we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets using these techniques. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that secondary eclipse observations are highly degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres, given the wide range of potential surface albedos. We also show that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black-body planet in these filters. These two results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission, except in a subset of CO$_{2}$-dominated atmospheres. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets, allowing the unambiguous detection of atmospheres by night-side emission.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>
