      <title>Large Language Models for Knowledge-Free Network Management: Feasibility Study and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional network management algorithms have relied on prior knowledge of system models and networking scenarios. In practice, a universal optimization framework is desirable where a sole optimization module can be readily applied to arbitrary network management tasks without any knowledge of the system. To this end, knowledge-free optimization techniques are necessary whose operations are independent of scenario-specific information including objective functions, system parameters, and network setups. The major challenge of this paradigm-shifting approach is the requirement of a hyper-intelligent black-box optimizer that can establish efficient decision-making policies using its internal reasoning capabilities. This article presents a novel knowledge-free network management paradigm with the power of foundation models called large language models (LLMs). Trained on vast amounts of datasets, LLMs can understand important contexts from input prompts containing minimal system information, thereby offering remarkable inference performance even for entirely new tasks. Pretrained LLMs can be potentially leveraged as foundation models for versatile network optimization. By eliminating the dependency on prior knowledge, LLMs can be seamlessly applied for various network management tasks. The viability of this approach is demonstrated for resource management problems using GPT-3.5-Turbo. Numerical results validate that knowledge-free LLM optimizers are able to achieve comparable performance to existing knowledge-based optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven AI for Channel Estimation in Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cellular mobile networks, wireless channel quality (CQ) is a crucial factor in determining communication performance and user's network experience. Accurately predicting CQ based on real environmental characteristics, specific base station configurations and user trajectories can help network operators optimize base station deployment, improving coverage and capacity. The Received Signal Reference Power (RSRP) and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of user equipment (UE) are key indicators of CQ in wireless communication. However, existing researches have limitations in terms of generation accuracy. Regression methods such as statistical inference and random forests fail to effectively capture the unique characteristics of wireless environments; theoretical derivations relying on specific communication protocols lack generalization capability; data-driven machine learning (ML) methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network often suffer from a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose physics-informed diffusion models, which accurately generate RSRP and SINR at UE based on the wireless environment, base station configurations, and user trajectories. The model adopts a modular and end-to-end design, employing a teacher-student framework to achieve knowledge distillation. This method integrates expert knowledge into the training of diffusion models, enhancing both the interpretability and accuracy, while also facilitating faster convergence of the model parameters. Furthermore, it allows for self-adaptation in various scenarios through few-shot learning. This approach provides valuable guidance for optimizing base station deployment, predicting user network experience, and building real-world simulators.</description>

      <title>Ultra-reliable urban air mobility networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted attention as an emerging technology that will bring innovation to urban transportation and aviation systems. Since the UAM systems pursue fully autonomous flight without a pilot, wireless communication is a key function not only for flight control signals, but also for navigation and safety information. The essential information is called a command and control (C2) message, and the UAM networks must be configured so that the UAM can receive the C2 message by securing a continuous link stability without any interruptions. Nevertheless, a lot of prior works have focused only on improving the average performance without solving the low-reliability in the cell edges and coverage holes of urban areas. In this dissertation, we identify the factors that hinder the communication link reliability in considering three-dimensional (3D) urban environments, and propose a antenna configuration, resource utilization, and transmission strategy to enable UAM receiving C2 messages regardless of time and space. First, through stochastic geometry modeling, we analyze the signal blockage effects caused by the urban buildings. The blockage probability is calculated according to the shape, height, and density of the buildings, and the coverage probability of the received signal is derived by reflecting the blockage events. Furthermore, the low-reliability area is identified by analyzing the coverage performance according to the positions of the UAMs. To overcome the low-reliability region, we propose three methods for UAM network operation: i) optimization of antennas elevation tilting, ii) frequency reuse with multi-layered narrow beam, and iii) assistive transmissions by the master UAM.</description>

      <title>V2V Path Loss Modeling at 26 GHz Based on Real-Traffic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate single-slope path loss models complemented with shadowing effects in the context of vehicular communications. We present several models obtained based on extensive measurement campaigns with inter-vehicle transmission conducted at 26.555 GHz in real-traffic experiments, mainly along high-speed roads. Particular attention has been put on the impact of aerial characteristics (omnidirectional versus directional), surrounding environment (e.g., urban versus rural), and their mounting point on cars (at the rooftop, on the bumper, and below the car chassis). Finally, the effect of signal ducting and of the number of blocking cars has been analyzed and the decorrelation time has been discussed</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spectrum Access for Ambient Backscatter Communication-assisted D2D Systems with Quantum Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum access is an essential problem in device-to-device (D2D) communications. However, with the recent growth in the number of mobile devices, the wireless spectrum is becoming scarce, resulting in low spectral efficiency for D2D communications. To address this problem, this paper aims to integrate the ambient backscatter communication technology into D2D devices to allow them to backscatter ambient RF signals to transmit their data when the shared spectrum is occupied by mobile users. To obtain the optimal spectrum access policy, i.e., stay idle or access the shared spectrum and perform active transmissions or backscattering ambient RF signals for transmissions, to maximize the average throughput for D2D users, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be adopted. However, DRL-based solutions may require long training time due to the curse of dimensionality issue as well as complex deep neural network architectures. For that, we develop a novel quantum reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that can achieve a faster convergence rate with fewer training parameters compared to DRL thanks to the quantum superposition and quantum entanglement principles. Specifically, instead of using conventional deep neural networks, the proposed quantum RL algorithm uses a parametrized quantum circuit to approximate an optimal policy. Extensive simulations then demonstrate that the proposed solution not only can significantly improve the average throughput of D2D devices when the shared spectrum is busy but also can achieve much better performance in terms of convergence rate and learning complexity compared to existing DRL-based methods.</description>

      <title>Digital Network Twins for Next-generation Wireless: Creation, Optimization, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Robocalls with Multiple Vantage Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telephone spam has been among the highest network security concerns for users for many years. In response, industry and government have deployed new technologies and regulations to curb the problem, and academic and industry researchers have provided methods and measurements to characterize robocalls. Have these efforts borne fruit? Are the research characterizations reliable, and have the prevention and deterrence mechanisms succeeded?
  In this paper, we address these questions through analysis of data from several independently-operated vantage points, ranging from industry and academic voice honeypots to public enforcement and consumer complaints, some with over 5 years of historic data. We first describe how we address the non-trivial methodological challenges of comparing disparate data sources, including comparing audio and transcripts from about 3 million voice calls. We also detail the substantial coherency of these diverse perspectives, which dramatically strengthens the evidence for the conclusions we draw about robocall characterization and mitigation while highlighting advantages of each approach. Among our many findings, we find that unsolicited calls are in slow decline, though complaints and call volumes remain high. We also find that robocallers have managed to adapt to STIR/SHAKEN, a mandatory call authentication scheme. In total, our findings highlight the most promising directions for future efforts to characterize and stop telephone spam.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperscalers dominate the landscape of large network deployments, yet they rarely share data or insights about the challenges they face. In light of this supremacy, what problems can we find to solve in this space? We take an unconventional approach to find relevant research directions, starting from public plans to build a $100 billion datacenter for machine learning applications. Leveraging the language models scaling laws, we discover what workloads such a datacenter might carry and explore the challenges one may encounter in doing so, with a focus on networking research. We conclude that building the datacenter and training such models is technically possible, but this requires novel wide-area transports for inter-DC communication, a multipath transport and novel datacenter topologies for intra-datacenter communication, high speed scale-up networks and transports, outlining a rich research agenda for the networking community.</description>

      <title>KeySpace: Public Key Infrastructure Considerations in Interplanetary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As satellite networks grow larger and begin to incorporate interplanetary communication, there is an increasing interest in the unsolved problem of how to approach PKI in these conditions. In this paper we explore the goals and requirements for implementing key management systems in satellite networks, focusing on megaconstellations and interplanetary networks. We design a set of standardized experiments which can be used to compare systems against one another for particular network topologies. Using these, we demonstrate that terrestrial PKI techniques are feasible in highly distributed interplanetary networks, showing that it is possible to configure PKI systems to achieve efficient low-latency connection establishment, and minimize the impact of attacks through effective revocations.
  We evaluate this by building the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS), a novel network simulator aimed at efficient simulation of large space networks. We run simulations evaluating connection establishment and key revocation under a wide range of PKI configurations. Finally, we propose and evaluate two additional configuration options: OCSP Hybrid, and the use of relay nodes as a firewall. Together these minimize the extent of the network an attacker can reach with a compromised key, and reduce the attacker's load on interplanetary relay links.</description>
