      <title>On the Detection of Exorings in Reflected Light with JWST NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When directly imaging a cold giant exoplanet hosting a ring system, the reflected light from the rings can outshine the planet's thermal emission and reflected-light in the near-infrared. Consequently, an exoring may be detectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the exoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in near-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of two nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most favorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W + MASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times that of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader simulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around mature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach up to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that NIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in reflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W coronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first empirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the existence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary disks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight into the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based generative model for planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return, be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model, trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used, for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally, as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: Assessing the Ability of Direct Imaging Surveys to Empirically Constrain the Habitable Zone via Trends in Albedo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Will future direct imaging missions such as NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) be able to understand Earth-sized planets as a population? In this study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to uncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and potentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the Bioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the scientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a synthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo and simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical power to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of the injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of roughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker albedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission is designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would be able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable zone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore multiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as reducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables such as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo from full spectral retrievals.</description>

      <title>Reassessment of Kepler's habitable zone Earth-like exoplanets with data-driven null-signal templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\oplus}$, a period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\oplus}$ and a period of 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.</description>

      <title>Simulating RISTRETTO: Proxima b detectability in reflected light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is one of the key topics in modern astrophysics. To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy, and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo. In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about 85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.</description>

      <title>3I/ATLAS: In Search of the Witnesses to Its Voyage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusually high excess velocity and active cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy planetesimals. Understanding its origin requires tracing its past trajectory through the Galaxy and assessing the possible role of stellar encounters, both as a potential origin and a perturber to its orbit. We integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages within 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the $2\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change of $|\Delta v| \simeq 5\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin. We further show that 3I/ATLAS is kinematically consistent with a thin-disk population, despite its large peculiar velocity.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Cometary Anti-tails as Observed in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun. This type of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetospheric Rebound in Breaking Resonant Chains of Super-Earths and Mini-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic fields are thought to truncate the inner regions of protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars, creating a magnetospheric cavity near the star. As the disk evolves and disperses, the truncation radius is expected to move outward as the balance between magnetic and viscous forces shifts. Planets migrating inward can become trapped near the inner edge, but as the edge itself moves outward, the evolving disk torques can drive planets to migrate outward as well. We employ N-body simulations to assess the influence of magnetospheric cavity expansion on the dynamical evolution and orbital architectures of compact resonant chains of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our results show that rebound-driven expansion of the disk's inner edge plays a pivotal role in destabilizing resonant chains by spreading planetary systems outward, thereby triggering early dynamical instabilities and giant impacts. Despite this dynamical evolution, key observable properties of close-in planetary systems -- such as the distribution of orbital period ratio, the intra-system similarity in planet sizes (``radius uniformity''), and the bimodal distribution of planet radii known as the ``radius valley'' -- remain largely consistent with those of systems formed without the rebound effect, in which the inner edge of the disk remains fixed. Thus, the primary consequence of the rebound appears to be the early disruption of resonant chains, rather than any significant alteration to the statistical properties of the resulting super-Earth and mini-Neptune populations.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics in TOI-178 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TOI-178 system hosts six planets with five of them locked in a :4:6:9:12 Laplace resonance chain. We perform N-body simulations to investigate the dynamics of test particles in this system. We observe that co-orbital regions around each planet are approximately 30\% wider than predicted by classical theory for planets in the resonance chain, while TOI-178b, which lies outside the chain, shows a 52\% enhancement. The region between TOI-178e and TOI-178f reveals Kirkwood gap-like structures created by mean-motion resonances with TOI-178f (4:3, 5:4, 6:5) and TOI-178g (5:3), where particle clearing occurs on 500-year timescales. An extended integration of the innermost region (0.015-0.025 au) shows periodic inclination oscillations with period 196 years, coincident with TOI-178b's own oscillation period, with maximum amplitude occurring near the 3:2 resonance location. These structures are consistent with the system's resonant architecture and provide a baseline characterization that enables future comparative studies of similar phenomena in other multi-planet systems with resonant configurations.</description>

      <title>The JADE code. II. Modeling the coupled orbital and atmospheric evolution of GJ 436 b to constrain its migration and companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms. To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar spin-orbit angle that has survived within the "hot Neptune desert" despite ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000 simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80{\deg} - 100{\deg} with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets have maximum radii close to that of Jupiter. Qualitatively, the reason for this maximum size is that, as one adds mass, the force of gravity becomes sufficiently strong to cause the radius to decrease. We show that this effect can be understood quantitatively using a simple variational principle very similar to that used to compute the size of the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Flare Chemistry in Brown Dwarf Companions to Active M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs that are short period ($&lt;10\,$day) companions to actively flaring M dwarfs may provide a context to directly observe flare-driven photochemistry and structural changes in an extrasolar planet-like atmosphere. To assess the viability of directly observing flare impacts in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, we perform self-consistent temperature-chemistry modeling of the atmospheric response to individual energetic superflares. We modified the existing open-source \texttt{VULCAN} chemical-kinetics and \texttt{HELIOS} radiative-transfer codes for this purpose. Similar to previous studies of flare impacts on hydrogen dominated atmospheres, we find flares are capable of orders-of-magnitude changes in the mixing abundances of many chemical species, including important opacity sources like CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. However, due to fast chemical timescales resulting from high temperatures and densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, these changes last for a short-period of time, generally less than a day, and are only plausibly observable via high resolution emission spectroscopy. We find that the most observable, short-term spectral changes in hot (T$_{\text{eff}}\sim2000\,$K), high-gravity ($\log{\text{g}}\sim5$), cloudless brown dwarfs are the photolysis of H$_2$O and enhancement of CO$_2$, which can result in part-per-thousands spectral changes in the hours after a flare.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field and Plasma Asymmetries Between the Martian Quasi-Perpendicular and Quasi-Parallel Magnetosheaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Martian magnetosheath acts as a conduit for mass and energy transfer between the upstream solar wind and its induced magnetosphere. However, our understanding of its global properties remains limited. Using nine years of data from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis to explore the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields, solar wind and planetary ions in the magnetosheath. We discovered significant asymmetries in the magnetic field, solar wind protons, and planetary ions between the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel magnetosheaths. The asymmetries in the Martian magnetosheath exhibit both similarities and differences compared to those in the Earth's and Venus' magnetosheaths. These results indicate that the Martian magnetosheath is distinctly shaped by both shock geometry and planetary ions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Mode Propulsion Mission Design Using Direct Collocation</title>

Abstract: The problem of minimizing the transfer time between periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon elliptic restricted three-body problem using a multi-mode propulsion system is considered. By employing the true anomaly on the primary orbit as the independent variable and introducing normalized time as an additional state, the need to repeatedly solve Kepler's equation at arbitrary epochs is eliminated. Furthermore, a propellant constraint is imposed on the high-thrust mode to activate the multi-mode capabilities of the system and balance efficiency with maneuverability. The minimum-time optimal control problem is formulated as a three-phase trajectory consisting of a coast along the initial periodic orbit, a controlled transfer, and a coast along the terminal periodic orbit. The three-phase optimal control problem is then solved using an adaptive Gaussian quadrature direct collocation method. Case studies are presented for transfers from an L2 southern halo orbit to a near-rectilinear halo orbit, analyzing the impact of different single- and multi-mode propulsion architectures and varying propellant constraint values. Finally, the methodology developed in this paper provides a systematic framework for generating periodic orbit transfers in three-body systems using single- and multi-mode propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.</description>

      <title>Seismic Oscillations Excited by Giant Impacts in Directly-Imaged Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radii and masses of many giant exoplanets imply their interiors each contain more than $\sim$100 $M_\oplus$ of solids. A large metal content may arise when a giant planet grows by colliding and merging with multiple $\sim$10 $M_\oplus$ solid cores. Here we show that a giant impact with a young gas giant excites long-lived seismic oscillations that can be detected photometrically. Mode lifetimes are close to the planet's Kelvin-Helmholtz time, a significant fraction of a young planet's age. Oscillation periods lie between tens of minutes to an hour, and variability amplitudes can exceed a percent for several million years. Beta Pictoris b is a young super-Jupiter known to be highly metal-enriched. If a Neptune-mass (17 $M_\oplus$) body impacted $\beta$ Pictoris b in the past $\sim$9--18 Myr, the planet could still be ringing with a percent-level photometric variability measurable with JWST.</description>

      <title>Why M-dwarf flares have limited impact on the atmospheric evaporation of sub-Neptunes and Earth-sized planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M-type stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches within their habitable zones (HZs). These stars also exhibit significant magnetic flaring activity, particularly during their first billion years, which can potentially accelerate the evaporation of the hydrogen-helium envelopes of close-in planets. We employ the time-dependent photoionization hydrodynamics code ATES to investigate the impact of flares on atmospheric escape, focusing on an Earth-sized and a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an early M-type star at distances of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.18-0.36 AU-the inner and outer edges of the HZ. Stellar flaring is modeled as a 1 Gyr-long high-activity phase followed by a 4 Gyr-long low-activity phase, each characterized by an appropriate flare frequency distribution. We find that flares have a modest impact-less than a factor of two-on the cumulative atmospheric mass loss, with the greatest absolute enhancement occurring when the planets are at their closest separation. However, the relative enhancement in mass loss between flaring and non-flaring cases is greater at larger orbital separations. This trend arises because, as stellar irradiation fluctuates between quiescent levels and peak flares, the proportion of time that a planet spends in the energy-limited versus recombination-limited mass loss regimes depends on its orbital separation. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a characteristic flare energy, intermediate between the minimum and maximum values, that maximizes the fractional contribution to flare-driven mass loss. Our results indicate that the flaring activity of M-dwarfs does not significantly affect the atmospheric retention of close-in planets, including those within the HZ. The potential occurrence of rare super-flares, which current observational campaigns may be biased against, does not alter our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Plane of the Distant Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of any unseen planetary-mass bodies in the outer solar system, the mean plane of the distant Kuiper belt should be the same as the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector of the solar system -- the invariable plane. Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across semimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane that we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our results are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the celestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor axes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not at 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation for this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body simulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the Earth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\gtrsim 10^{\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters outside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both mass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked to explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or deny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that may produce it.</description>

      <title>ATLAS Photometry of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.014 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.2}. We interpret the evolution as a shift from dust lifted from a reddened surface to production of small, optically bright icy grains and changing coma optical depth. We release the aperture photometry with geometry and uncertainties to enable cross-instrument synthesis of 3I/ATLAS activity and color evolution.</description>
