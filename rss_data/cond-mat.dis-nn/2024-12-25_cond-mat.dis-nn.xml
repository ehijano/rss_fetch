      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Kubo-Suzuki Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions as the temperature decreases with the annealing which practically remains (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grows to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 8000) the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E_0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0003 $ (the universal value is $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$.</description>

      <title>Minimalistic and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing Enhanced with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing only a few two-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurements. To achieve high computational expressivity with minimal hardware, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its hardware, while polynomial regression enhances output resolution by nonlinearly extending expressions. We evaluate QRC's memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. Our results demonstrate significant QRC performance with minimal reservoirs containing as few as five atoms, further enhanced by feedback mechanisms and polynomial regression. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological defects and spin liquid in a two-orbital spin-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing exotic quantum phases of matter, e.g. spin liquid, is an attractive topic in condensed matter. Here, by a Monte Carlo study of a two-orbital spin-fermion model on a honeycomb lattice, we show the cooperative effects of the orbital degeneracy of itinerant electrons and the exchange interaction of localized spins can significantly suppress both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders by generating topological defects and give rise to an intermediate spin liquid state via continuous phase transitions. This phase competition can also be achieved by tuning the electron filling. These results shed new light on realizing spin liquids on geometrically non-frustrated lattices.</description>

      <title>Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</description>

      <title>Temperature crossovers in the specific heat of amorphous magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is argued that the specific heat of amorphous solids at low temperatures can be understood to arise from a single branch of collective modes. The idea is illustrated in a model of a correlated spin glass for which magnetic anisotropies are present but they are completely frustrated by disorder. The low-energy spectrum is dominated by soft modes corresponding to propagating Halperin-Saslow spin waves at short wavelengths, evolving into a relaxation and a diffuson mode at the long wavelengths. The latter gives rise to an anomalous temperature behavior of the specific heat at $T\ll T_{*}$: $C\sim T$ in $d=3$ solids, $C\sim T\ln(1/T)$ in $d=2$. The temperature scale $T_{*}$ has a non-trivial dependence on the damping coefficient describing magnetic friction, which can be related to fluctuations of the spin-torque operator via a Green-Kubo formula. Halperin-Saslow modes can also become diffusive due to disclination motion (plastic flow). Extensions of these ideas to other systems (including disordered phases of correlated electrons in cuprate superconductors and of moir\'e superlattices) are discussed</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Generating Hard Ising Instances With Planted Solutions Using Post-Quantum Cryptographic Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel method to generate hard instances with planted solutions based on the public-private McEliece post-quantum cryptographic protocol. Unlike other planting methods rooted in the infinite-size statistical analysis, our cryptographic protocol generates instances which are all hard (in cryptographic terms), with the hardness tuned by the size of the private key, and with a guaranteed unique ground state. More importantly, because of the private-public key protocol, planted solutions cannot be easily recovered by a direct inspection of the planted instances without the knowledge of the private key used to generate them, therefore making our protocol suitable to test and evaluate quantum devices without the risk of "backdoors" being exploited.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition in Diffusion Models Reveals the Hierarchical Nature of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of real data is paramount in advancing modern deep-learning methodologies. Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organized in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying compositional structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time $t$ is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed, but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.</description>
