      <title>Debiasing with Diffusion: Probabilistic reconstruction of Dark Matter fields from galaxies with CAMELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying cosmic web, which is dominated by dark matter components that cannot be directly observed. Galaxy formation simulations can be used to study the relationship between dark matter density fields and galaxy distributions. However, this relationship can be sensitive to assumptions in cosmology and astrophysical processes embedded in the galaxy formation models, that remain uncertain in many aspects. In this work, we develop a diffusion generative model to reconstruct dark matter fields from galaxies. The diffusion model is trained on the CAMELS simulation suite that contains thousands of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations with varying cosmological parameters and sub-grid astrophysics. We demonstrate that the diffusion model can predict the unbiased posterior distribution of the underlying dark matter fields from the given stellar mass fields, while being able to marginalize over uncertainties in cosmological and astrophysical models. Interestingly, the model generalizes to simulation volumes approximately 500 times larger than those it was trained on, and across different galaxy formation models.

      <title>TDCOSMO XVI: Population Analysis of Lines of Sight of 25 Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Extreme Value Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Delay Cosmography is a technique for masuring $H_0$ with strong gravitational lensing. It requires a correction for line of sight perturbations, and it is necessary to build tools to assess populations of these lines of sight efficiently. We aim demonstrate the techniques necessary to analyze line of sight effects at a population level, and investigate whether strong lenses fall in preferably overdense environments. We analyze a set of 25 galaxy-galaxy lens lines of sight in the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey sample using standard techniques, then perform a hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level parameters. We introduce a new statistical model for these posteriors that may provide insight into the underlying physics of the system. We find the median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ in the population model to be $0.033 \pm 0.010$. The median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ for the individual lens posteriors is $0.008 \pm 0.015$. Both approaches demostrate that our systems are drawn from an overdense sample. The difference results form these two approaches show the importance of population models that do not multiply the effect of our priors.</description>

      <title>$H_0$-tension in the classical limit of Big Bang quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM is challenged by observational tensions between late- and early-time cosmology, most dramatically in the Hubble constant $H_0$. $\Lambda$CDM hereby falls short as an effective infra-red (IR) limit of quantum cosmology. Consistency with general relativity in an effective dark energy $\Lambda=\alpha_p\Lambda_0\sim H^2/c^2$ obtains from an IR-coupling $\alpha_p\sim \hbar$ to the bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0\sim 1/\hbar$, where $\hbar$ is the Planck constant. A path integral formulation with gauged total phase identifies $\Lambda$ with the trace of the Schouten tensor $J$. It predicts the scaling $H_0\simeq \sqrt{6/5}H_0^{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}$ inferred from the BAO, while preserving the age of the Universe. With no free parameters, this first principle model predicts a 9\% departure in $H_0$ between the Local Distance Ladder and the $\Lambda$CDM {\em Planck} measurements with no tension between late and early times. In galaxies, the same IR coupling predicts a sharp transition to anomalous rotation curves below the de Sitter acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light. Excluded by galaxy models in $\Lambda$CDM, it points to ultra-light dark matter of mass $m_D\lesssim 3\times 10^{-21}$eV consistent with $m_D\gtrsim 10^{-22}$eV of wave-like $\psi$CDM.</description>

      <title>The redshift evolution of primordial black hole merger rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration can be explained by mergers of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation dominated epoch. However, in early structures induced by the Poisson distribution of PBHs, a significant fraction of binaries are perturbed and avoid mergers. In addition, the internal dynamics of early halos lead to the formation of dense primordial black hole clusters within a few Hubble times from the moment of halo formation. In such clusters PBH binaries are effectively formed and their mergers potentially dominate in the modern era. We obtained that the PBH merger rate changes with redshift as $\mathcal{R} \propto (1 + z)^\beta$, where $\beta = 1.4 - 2.2$ reflects the influence of PBH clustering and depends on both $z$ and $f_{\rm PBH}$. The observed merger rate constraints the fraction of PBHs of tens solar masses in the composition of dark matter $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 0.001 - 0.1$ in dependence of the clustering efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from self-interaction can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a galaxy resembling DF2 in all its observed properties. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of self-interaction. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning LSST 3x2pt analyses -- forecasting the impact of systematics on cosmological constraints using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating modeling choices through simulated analyses and quantifying the impact of different systematic effects will form a major computational bottleneck in the preparation for 3$\times$2 analysis with Stage-IV surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We can significantly reduce the computational requirements by using machine learning based emulators, which allow us to run fast inference while maintaining the full realism of the data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we use such an emulator to run simulated 3$\times$2 (cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering) analyses for mock LSST-Y1/Y3/Y6/Y10 surveys and study the impact of various systematic effects (galaxy bias, intrinsic alignment, baryonic physics, shear calibration and photo-$z$ uncertainties). Closely following the DESC Science Requirement Document (with several updates) our main findings are: {\it a)} The largest contribution to the `systematic error budget' of LSST 3$\times$2 analysis comes from galaxy bias uncertainties, while the contribution of baryonic and shear calibration uncertainties are significantly less important. {\it b)} Tighter constraints on intrinsic alignment and photo-$z$ parameters can improve cosmological constraints noticeably, which illustrates synergies of LSST and spectroscopic surveys. {\it c)} The scale cuts adopted in the DESC SRD may be too conservative and pushing to smaller scales can increase cosmological information significantly. {\it d)} We investigate the impact of photo-$z$ outliers on 3$\times$2 pt analysis and find that we need to determine the outlier fraction to within $5-10\%$ accuracy to ensure robust cosmological analysis. We caution that these findings depend on analysis choices (parameterizations, priors, scale cuts) and can change for different settings.</description>

      <title>Sound Horizon Independent Constraints on Early Dark Energy: The Role of Supernova Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the consistency of cosmological models that alter the size of the sound horizon at last scattering to resolve the Hubble tension with data from ACT + Planck CMB lensing, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and supernova data from Pantheon or Pantheon+. We use early dark energy (EDE) as an example model but conclude that the results apply to other similar models. We constrain $\Lambda$CDM and EDE with these data finding that while they can constrain $\Lambda$CDM very tightly, EDE opens up the parameter space significantly and allows $H_0 &gt; 72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We combine these data with measurements from ACT + Planck TT650TEEE CMB primary anisotropy and galaxy baryon acoustic oscillations, and find that overall, EDE fits these data better than $\Lambda$CDM at $\approx 2\sigma$. However, the fit to specifically the sound-horizon-independent measurements is worse for EDE than $\Lambda$CDM. We assess this increase in $\chi^2$ coming from the sound-horizon-independent measurements and find that the best-fit model is still consistent with a random statistical fluctuation even with $H_0$ values around $72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that these specific sound-horizon-independent data cannot rule out the possibility of a miscalibration of the size of the sound horizon, but leave open the possibility that other current or future sound-horizon-independent data sets could rule out such a miscalibration.</description>

      <title>Displacement Field Analysis via Optimal Transport: Multi-Tracer Approach to Cosmological Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of one of the many multi-tracer analyses enabled by Optimal Transport (OT) reconstruction. Leveraging a semi-discrete OT algorithm, we determine the displacements between initial and observed positions of biased tracers and the remaining matter field. With only redshift-space distorted final positions of biased tracers and a simple premise for the remaining mass distribution as input, OT solves the displacement field. This extracted field, assuming asymptotically uniform density and a gradient flow displacement, enables reconstruction of the initial overdensity fluctuation field. We show that the divergence of the OT displacement field is a good proxy of the linear density field, even though the method never assumes the linear theory growth. Additionally, this divergence field can be combined with the reconstructed protohalos to provide a higher signal-to-noise measurement of the BAO standard ruler than was possible with either measurement individually.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical lens mass model parameters, even though the simplest singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models yield a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom $\simeq 2$. To date, this problem has been alleviated by introducing additional empirical parameters in the extended power law (EPL) models and constraints from high resolution imagery. The EPL parameters are taken to vary from lens to lens, rather than defining universal lens profiles. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW Timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) to simulate large mock catalogues for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the Timescape model. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to any cosmological model. In agreement with previous results we find that in combination with SIS parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\rm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the Timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73$ matches, close to values found to best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for Timescape fits to both Timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with non-FLRW spatial curvature evolution.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB spectrum distortions from dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even after dark matter chemically freezes out in the early universe, electromagnetic cascades from dark matter annihilation can still perturb the background photon spectrum when the universe temperature cools down to 0.5~keV. We revisit the CMB spectrum distortions caused by $s$-wave dark matter annihilation under the updated Planck data and the future CMB sensitivity, concluding that $s$-wave annihilation cannot create observable distortions under forecast sensitivities of the (Super-)PIXIE missions. We further detail the case of $p$-wave dark matter annihilation, demonstrating the observability of the primordial $\mu$-distortion. Taking current constraints from primordial light elements, structure formations, cosmic electron-positron rays, and gamma rays, we find that the $\mu$-distortion reaching the observational limit as large as $\mu\simeq 3\times 10^{-8}$ can only be realized by a dark matter mass at 10--50~MeV and kinetic decoupling at keV temperature. The upper bound of the $p$-wave annihilation cross section can be strengthened by an order of magnitude if the $\mu$-distortion is not detected.</description>

      <title>Zooming by in the CARPoolGP lane: new CAMELS-TNG simulations of zoomed-in massive halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy formation models within cosmological hydrodynamical simulations contain numerous parameters with non-trivial influences over the resulting properties of simulated cosmic structures and galaxy populations. It is computationally challenging to sample these high dimensional parameter spaces with simulations, particularly for halos in the high-mass end of the mass function. In this work, we develop a novel sampling and reduced variance regression method, CARPoolGP, which leverages built-in correlations between samples in different locations of high dimensional parameter spaces to provide an efficient way to explore parameter space and generate low variance emulations of summary statistics. We use this method to extend the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) to include a set of 768 zoom-in simulations of halos in the mass range of $10^{13} - 10^{14.5} M_\odot\,h^{-1}$ that span a 28-dimensional parameter space in the IllustrisTNG model. With these simulations and the CARPoolGP emulation method, we explore parameter trends in the Compton $Y-M$, black hole mass-halo mass, and metallicity-mass relations, as well as thermodynamic profiles and quenched fractions of satellite galaxies. We use these emulations to provide a physical picture of the complex interplay between supernova and active galactic nuclei feedback. We then use emulations of the $Y-M$ relation of massive halos to perform Fisher forecasts on astrophysical parameters for future Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations and find a significant improvement in forecasted constraints. We publicly release both the simulation suite and CARPoolGP software package.</description>

      <title>Testing a Galactic Lensing Hypothesis with the Prompt Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even at modest amplification, the optical depth to gravitational lensing through the Galaxy is $&lt;10^{-5}$. However, the large apparent isotropic-equivalent energy of GRB 221009A coupled with a path through low Galactic latitude suggests that the conditional probability that this particular GRB was lensed is greater than the very low a priori expectation. With the extreme brightness of the prompt emission, this Galactic lensing hypothesis can be constrained by autocorrelation analysis of Fermi photons on 0.1-1000 ms timescales. In relating lensing mass, magnification, and autocorrelation timescale, I show that a lensed-induced autocorrelation signature by stellar lenses falls below the minimal variability timescale (MVT) expected from a black hole central engine. However, lensing by Galactic dark matter MACHOs ($M_l &gt; 10-1000\,M_\odot$) could be confirmed with this approach. Regardless, at a peak $\gamma$-ray photon rate of $&gt;30$ ms$^{-1}$, GRB 221009A represents a prime opportunity to measure the smallest MVTs of GRBs.</description>

      <title>CSST large-scale structure analysis pipeline: I. constructing reference mock galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we set out to construct a set of reference mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs) for the future Chinese Space-station Survey Telescope (CSST) observation, where subsequent survey selection effects can be added and evaluated. This set of MGRSs is generated using the dark matter subhalos extracted from a high-resolution Jiutian $N$-body simulation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony with $\Omega_m=0.3111$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.6889$, and $\sigma_8=0.8102$. The simulation has a boxsize of $1~h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$, and consists of $6144^3$ particles with mass resolution $3.723 \times 10^{8} h^{-1} M_\odot $. In order to take into account the effect of redshift evolution, we first use all 128 snapshots in the Jiutian simulation to generate a light-cone halo/subhalo catalog. Next, galaxy luminosities are assigned to the main and subhalo populations using the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) method with the DESI $z$-band luminosity functions at different redshifts. Multi-band photometries, as well as images, are then assigned to each mock galaxy using a 3-dimensional parameter space nearest neighbor sampling of the DESI LS observational galaxies and groups. Finally, the CSST and DESI LS survey geometry and magnitude limit cuts are applied to generate the required MGRSs. As we have checked, this set of MGRSs can generally reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity/mass functions within 0.1 dex for galaxies with $L &gt; 10^8 L_\odot$ (or $M_* &gt; 10^{8.5} M_\odot$) and within 1-$\sigma$ level for galaxies with $L &lt; 10^8L_\odot$ (or $M_* &lt; 10^{8.5} M_\odot$). Together with the CSST slitless spectra and redshifts for our DESI LS seed galaxies that are under construction, we will set out to test various slitless observational selection effects in subsequent probes.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses.As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity explain dark energy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of \GR~could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an \IDG~model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>

      <title>Impact of local CP-odd domain in hot QCD on axionic domain-wall interpretation for NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the axionic domain-wall with a QCD bias may be incompatible with the NANOGrav 15-year data on a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, when the domain wall network collapses in the hot-QCD induced local CP-odd domain. This is due to the drastic suppression of the QCD bias set by the QCD topological susceptibility in the presence of the CP-odd domain with nonzero $\theta$ parameter of order one which the QCD sphaleron could generate. We quantify the effect on the GW signals by working on a low-energy effective model of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type in the mean field approximation. We find that only at $\theta=\pi$, the QCD bias tends to get significantly large enough due to the criticality of the thermal CP restoration, which would, however, give too big signal strengths to be consistent with the NANOGrav 15-year data and would also be subject to the strength of the phase transition at the criticality.</description>

      <title>Resolving the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with neutrino mass and chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is to allow relic neutrinos to have non-zero degeneracy. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi_3$ as additional parameters, with the \textit{Planck} TT, lowT, plik--lensing, BAO, and DES datasets, and we observe a strong preference (Bayes factor $\log_{10}B=1.9$) for it over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are resolved to within 1$\sigma$ with the same set of neutrino parameters, along with 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M_\nu=0.58^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\ \mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi_3=1.27^{+0.42}_{-0.22}$). Furthermore, our analysis favors the scalar index $n_s$ to be slightly larger than 1, compatible with some hybrid inflation models, as well as a significantly larger optical depth $\tau$ than the standard Planck value, indicating an earlier onset of reionization.</description>

      <title>ARTEMIS emulator: exploring the effect of cosmology and galaxy formation physics on Milky Way-mass haloes and their satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the new ARTEMIS emulator suite of high resolution (baryon mass of $2.23 \times 10^{4}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$) zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass systems. Here, three haloes from the original ARTEMIS sample have been rerun multiple times, systematically varying parameters for the stellar feedback model, the density threshold for star formation, the reionisation redshift and the assumed warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass (assuming a thermal relic). From these simulations emulators are trained for a wide range of statistics that allow for fast predictions at combinations of parameters not originally sampled, running in $\sim 1$ms (a factor of $\sim 10^{11}$ faster than the simulations). In this paper we explore the dependence of the central haloes' stellar mass on the varied parameters, finding the stellar feedback parameters to be the most important. When constraining the parameters to match the present-day stellar mass halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching we find that there is a strong degeneracy in the stellar feedback parameters, corresponding to a freedom in formation time of the stellar component for a fixed halo assembly history. We additionally explore the dependence of the satellite stellar mass function, where it is found that variations in stellar feedback, the reionisation redshift and the WDM mass all have a significant effect. The presented emulators are a powerful tool which allows for fundamentally new ways of analysing and interpreting cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Crucially, allowing their free (subgrid) parameters to be varied and marginalised, leading to more robust constraints and predictions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the effect of local type non-Gaussianity on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBH) based on the peak theory. We provide the PBH formation criterion based on the so-called compaction function and use the peak theory statistics associated with the curvature perturbation with the local type non-Gaussianity. Providing a method to estimate the PBH abundance, we demonstrate the effects of non-Gaussianity. It is explicitly shown that the value of non-linear parameter $|f_{\rm NL}| \sim 1$ induces a similar effect to a few factors of difference in the amplitude of the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Abundance of Primordial Black Holes in Peak Theory for an Arbitrary Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.02425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify the procedure to estimate PBH abundance proposed in arXiv:1805.03946 so that it can be applied to a broad power spectrum such as the scale-invariant flat power spectrum. In the new procedure, we focus on peaks of the Laplacian of the curvature perturbation $\triangle \zeta$ and use the values of $\triangle \zeta$ and $\triangle \triangle \zeta $ at each peak to specify the profile of $\zeta$ as a function of the radial coordinate while the values of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ are used in arXiv:1805.03946. The new procedure decouples the larger-scale environmental effect from the estimate of PBH abundance. Because the redundant variance due to the environmental effect is eliminated, we obtain a narrower shape of the mass spectrum compared to the previous procedure in arXiv:1805.03946. Furthermore, the new procedure allows us to estimate PBH abundance for the scale-invariant flat power spectrum by introducing a window function. Although the final result depends on the choice of the window function, we show that the $k$-space tophat window minimizes the extra reduction of the mass spectrum due to the window function. That is, the $k$-space tophat window has the minimum required property in the theoretical PBH estimation. Our procedure makes it possible to calculate the PBH mass spectrum for an arbitrary power spectrum by using a plausible PBH formation criterion with the nonlinear relation taken into account.</description>

      <title>Putting Flat $\Lambda$CDM In The (Redshift) Bin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is specified by two constant fitting parameters at the background level in the late Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and matter density (today) $\Omega_m$. Mathematically, $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ are either integration constants arising from solving ordinary differential equations or are directly related to integration constants. Seen in this context, if fits of the $\Lambda$CDM model to cosmological probes at different redshifts lead to different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ parameters, this is a mismatch between mathematics and observation. Here, in mock observational Hubble data (OHD) (geometric probes of expansion history) we demonstrate evolution in distributions of best fit parameters with effective redshift. As a result, considerably different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ best fits from Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cannot be precluded in high redshift bins. We explore if OHD, Type Ia supernovae and standardisable quasar samples exhibit redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In all samples, we confirm a decreasing $H_0$ and increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with increasing bin redshift. Through comparison with mocks, we confirm that similar behaviour can arise randomly within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with probabilities as low as $p = 0.0021$ ($3.1 \, \sigma$). We present complementary profile distribution analysis confirming the shifts in cosmological parameters in high redshift bins. In particular, we identify a redshift range where Planck $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values are disfavoured at $99.6 \%$ ($2.9 \sigma$) confidence level in a combination of OHD and supernovae data.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a biased review of primordial black hole (PBH) formation and abundance estimation. We first review the three-zone model for PBH formation to help an intuitive understanding of the PBH formation process. Then, for more accurate analyses, we introduce necessary tools such as cosmological long-wavelength solutions, the definition of the mass and compaction function in a spherically symmetric spacetime and peak theory. Combining all these tools, we calculate the PBH mass spectrum for the case of the monochromatic curvature power spectrum as a demonstration.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies United by Dark Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low mass galaxies in the Local Group are dominated by dark matter and comprise the well studied ``dwarf Spheroidal" (dSph) class, with typical masses of $10^{9-10}M_\odot$ and also the equally numerous ``ultra faint dwarfs" (UFD), discovered recently, that are distinctly smaller and denser with masses of only $10^{7-8}M_\odot$. This bimodality amongst low mass galaxies contrasts with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as in the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model for heavy particles. Within each dwarf class we find the core radius $R_c$ is inversely related to velocity dispersion $\sigma$, quite the opposite of standard expectations, but indicative of dark matter in a Bose-Einstein state, where the Uncertainty Principle requires $R_c \times \sigma$ is fixed by Planks constant, $h$. The corresponding boson mass, $m_b=h/R_c \sigma$, differs by one order of magnitude between the UDF and dSph classes, with $10^{-21.4}$eV and $10^{-20.3}$eV respectively. Two boson species is reinforced by parallel relations seen between the central density and radius of UDF and dSph dwarfs respectively, each matching the steep prediction, $\rho_c \propto R_c^{-4}$, for soliton cores in the ground state. Furthermore, soliton cores accurately fit the stellar profiles of UDF and dSph dwarfs where prominent, dense cores appear surrounded by low density halos, as predicted by our simulations. Multiple bosons may point to a String Theory interpretation for dark matter, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass, offering a unifying "Axiverse" interpretation for the observed "diversity" of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The population of black holes inferred from the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has revealed interesting features in the properties of black holes in the Universe. We analyze the GWTC-3 dataset assuming the detected black holes in each event had an either astrophysical or primordial origin. In particular, we consider astrophysical black holes described by the fiducial \textsc{Power Law + Peak} distribution and primordial black holes whose mass function obeys a broken power law. These primordial black holes can be generated by vacuum bubbles that nucleate during inflation. We find that astrophysical black holes dominate the events with mass less than $\sim 30M_\odot$, whereas primordial black holes are responsible for the massive end, and also for the peak at $\sim 30M_\odot$ in the mass distribution. More than half of the observed events could come from primordial black hole mergers. We also discuss the implications on the primordial black hole formation mechanism and the underlying inflationary model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $S_8$ tension between low-redshift galaxy surveys and the primary CMB signals a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Recently differing results have been obtained using low-redshift galaxy surveys and the higher redshifts probed by CMB lensing, motivating a possible time-dependent modification to the growth of structure. We investigate a simple phenomenological model in which the growth of structure deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM prediction at late times, in particular as a simple function of the dark energy density. Fitting to galaxy lensing, CMB lensing, BAO, and Supernovae datasets, we find significant evidence - 2.5 - 3$\sigma$, depending on analysis choices - for a non-zero value of the parameter quantifying a deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. The preferred model, which has a slower growth of structure below $z\sim 1$, improves the joint fit to the data over $\Lambda$CDM. While the overall fit is improved, there is weak evidence for galaxy and CMB lensing favoring different changes in the growth of structure.</description>

Abstract: The cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) provides a unique testing ground for connecting fundamental physics to astronomical observations. Modeling the LSS requires numerical $N$-body simulations or perturbative techniques that both come with distinct shortcomings. Here we present the first unified numerical approach, enabled by new time integration and discreteness reduction schemes, and demonstrate its convergence at the field level. In particular, we show that our simulations (1) can be initialized directly at time zero, and (2) can be made to agree with high-order Lagrangian perturbation theory in the fluid limit. This enables fast, self-consistent, and UV-complete forward modeling of LSS observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the potential barrier between two interacting nuclei. We addressed this by solving the Boltzmann equation and Maxwell's theory in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in the determination of magnetized permittivity. Additionally, we derived the magnetized Debye potential, which combines the conventional Debye potential with an additional magnetic component. We then compared the Boltzmann approach with the Debye method. Both methods consistently demonstrate that magnetic fields increase permittivity. This enhanced permittivity leads to a reduction in the potential barrier, consequently increasing the reaction rate for nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, the dependence on temperature and electron density in each approach is consistent. Our findings suggest that magnetized plasmas, which have existed since the Big Bang, have played a crucial role in nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work, we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealized DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time-scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density, and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole seed scenarios with gravitational wave measurements</title>

Abstract: The process whereby the supermassive black holes populating the centers of galaxies have been assembled remains to be established, with the relative importance of seeds provided by collapsed Population-III stars, black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via repeated mergers, or direct collapses of protogalactic disks yet to be determined. In this paper we study the prospects for casting light on this issue by future measurements of gravitational waves emitted during the inspirals and mergers of pairs of intermediate-mass black holes, discussing in particular the roles of prospective measurements by LISA and the proposed atom interferometers AION and AEDGE. We find that, the expected number of detectable IMBH binaries is $O(100)$ for LISA and AEDGE and $O(10)$ for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to $O(10)$ for LISA and below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all of these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular if at least a fraction of the SMBHs arise from a low-mass seed population. We also show that the measurement accuracy of the binary parameters is, in general, best for AEDGE that sees very precisely the merger of the binary.</description>

      <title>Toward mapping turbulence in the intracluster medium III. Constraints on the turbulent power spectrum with Athena/X-IFU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Future X-ray observatories with high spectral resolution and imaging capabilities will enable measurements and mappings of emission line shifts in the intracluster medium (ICM). Such direct measurements can serve as unique probes of turbulent motions in the ICM. Determining the level and scales of turbulence will improve our understanding of the galaxy cluster dynamical evolution and assembly, together with a more precise evaluation of the non thermal support pressure budget. This will allow for more accurate constraints to be placed on the masses of galaxy clusters, among other potential benfits. Aims. In this view, we implemented the methods presented in the previous instalments of our work to characterize the turbulence in the ICM in a feasibility study with the X-IFU on board the future European X-ray observatory, Athena. Methods. From idealized mock observations of a toy model cluster, we reconstructed the second-order structure function built with the observed velocity field to constrain the turbulence. We carefully accounted for the various sources of errors to derive the most realistic and comprehensive error budget within the limits of our approach. With prior assumptions on the dissipation scale and power spectrum slope, we constrained the parameters of the turbulent power spectrum model through the use of MCMC sampling. Results. With favourable assumptions, we were able to retrieve the injection scale, velocity dispersion, and power spectrum slope, with 1sigma uncertainties better than ~15% of the input values. We demonstrated the efficiency of our carefully set framework to constrain the turbulence in the ICM from high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations, paving the way for more in-depth investigation of the optimal required observing strategy within a more restrictive observational setup with the future X-IFU instrument.</description>

      <title>General Multipoles and Their Implications for Dark Matter Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux ratios of strongly lensed quasars have previously been used to infer the properties of dark matter. In these analyses it is crucial to separate the effect of the main lensing galaxy and the low-mass dark matter halo population. In this work, we investigate flux-ratio perturbations resulting from general third- and fourth-order multipole perturbations to the main lensing galaxy's mass profile. We simulate four lens systems, each with a different lensing configuration, without multipoles. The simulated flux ratios are perturbed by 10-40 per cent by a population of low-mass haloes consistent with CDM and, in one case, also a satellite galaxy. This level of perturbation is comparable to the magnitude of flux-ratio anomalies in real data that has been previously analyzed. We then attempt to fit the simulated systems using multipoles instead of low-mass haloes. We find that multipoles with amplitudes of 0.01 or less can produce flux-ratio perturbations in excess of 40 per cent. In all cases, third- or fourth-order multipoles can individually reduce the magnitude of, if not eliminate, flux-ratio anomalies. When both multipole orders are jointly included, all simulated flux ratios can be fit to within the observational uncertainty. Our results indicate that low-mass haloes and multipoles are highly degenerate when modelling quadruply-imaged quasars based just on image positions and flux ratios. In the presence of this degeneracy, flux-ratio anomalies in lensed quasars alone cannot be used to place strong constraints on the properties of dark matter without additional information that can inform our priors.</description>

      <title>Post-inflationary production of particle Dark Matter: Hilltop and Coleman-Weinberg inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of non-thermal dark matter (DM), $\chi$, during post-inflationary reheating era. For inflation, we consider two slow roll single field inflationary scenarios - generalized version of Hilltop (GH) inflation, and Coleman-Weinberg (CW) inflation. Using a set of benchmark values that comply with the current constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data for each inflationary model, we explored the parameter space involving mass of dark matter particles, $m_\chi$, and coupling between inflaton and $\chi$, $y_\chi$. For these benchmarks, we find that tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be as small as $2.69\times 10^{-6}$ for GH and $1.91\times 10^{-3}$ for CW inflation, both well inside $1-\sigma$ contour on scalar spectral index versus $r$ plane from Planck2018+BICEP3+KeckArray2018 dataset, and testable by future cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations e.g. Simons Observatory. For the production of $\chi$ from the inflaton decay satisfying CMB and other cosmological bounds and successfully explaining total cold dark matter density of the present universe, we find that $y_\chi$ should be within this range ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right) \gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for both inflationary scenarios. We also show that, even for the same inflationary scenario, the allowed parameter space on reheating temperature versus $m_\chi$ plane alters with inflationary parameters including scalar spectral index, $r$, and energy scale of inflation.</description>

      <title>Quaia, the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog: An All-Sky Spectroscopic Quasar Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, all-sky quasar catalog, Quaia, that samples the largest comoving volume of any existing spectroscopic quasar sample. The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory's low-resolution BP/RP spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18% of even the bright ($G&lt;20.0$) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates ($|\Delta z/(1+z)|&gt;0.2$) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and Gaia and unWISE colors, reducing the number of contaminants by $\sim$4$\times$. We improve the redshifts by training a $k$-nearest neighbors model on SDSS redshifts, and achieve estimates on the $G&lt;20.0$ sample with only 6% (10%) catastrophic errors with $|\Delta z/(1+z)|&gt;0.2$ ($0.1$), a reduction of $\sim$3$\times$ ($\sim$2$\times$) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with $G&lt;20.5$, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner $G&lt;20.0$ sample, with accompanying rigorous selection function models. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses. The catalog is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/10403370.</description>

      <title>EDGE -- Dark matter or astrophysics? Breaking dark matter heating degeneracies with HI rotation in faint dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-mass dwarf galaxies are expected to reside within dark matter haloes that have a pristine, `cuspy' density profile within their stellar half-light radii. This is because they form too few stars to significantly drive dark matter heating through supernova-driven outflows. Here, we study such simulated faint systems ($10^4 \leq M_{\star} \leq 2\times 10^6 \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$) drawn from high-resolution (3 pc) cosmological simulations from the `Engineering Dwarf Galaxies at the Edge of galaxy formation' (EDGE) project. We confirm that these objects have steep and rising inner dark matter density profiles at $z=0$, little affected by galaxy formation effects. But five dwarf galaxies from the suite also showcase a detectable HI reservoir ($M_{\mathrm{HI}}\approx 10^{5}-10^{6} \, M_\mathrm{\odot}$), analogous to the observed population of faint, HI-bearing dwarf galaxies. These reservoirs exhibit episodes of ordered rotation, opening windows for rotation curve analysis. Within actively star-forming dwarfs, stellar feedback easily disrupts the tenuous HI discs ($v_{\phi} \approx 10\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), making rotation short-lived ($\ll 150 \, \mathrm{Myr}$) and more challenging to interpret for dark matter inferences. In contrast, we highlight a long-lived ($\geq 500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$) and easy-to-interpret HI rotation curve extending to $\approx 2\, r_{1/2, \text{3D}}$ in a quiescent dwarf, that has not formed new stars since $z=4$. This stable gas disc is supported by an oblate dark matter halo shape that drives high-angular momentum gas flows. Our results strongly motivate further searches for HI in rotation curves in the observed population of HI-bearing low-mass dwarfs, that provide a key regime to disentangle the respective roles of dark matter microphysics and galaxy formation effects in driving dark matter heating.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.07\pm0.20$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.49^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+2}_{-1}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.52^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$14\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.59 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with non-H$\alpha$ emitter galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

Abstract: At present, there is practically no doubt that general relativity is closely related to gravity. Moreover, after the work of Jacobson, Padmanabhan and others, it became clear that a thermodynamic interpretation of Einstein's relativistic equations is possible. On the other hand, we are witnessing the conceptual problems of the SCM (the problem of the cosmological constant, the problem of coincidences) and many years of futile attempts to directly fix the main components of the model (dark energy and dark matter). The combination of these two factors gave rise to a natural desire, at least at the phenomenological level, to build a cosmological model that represents the synthesis of gravity and thermodynamics and does not include components of an unknown nature. It is this model\`uentropic cosmology\`uthat is considered in this review. We have set as our goal, omitting the details that can be found in the references given, to present the conceptual foundations of the model.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves have become an irreplaceable tool for exploring the post-inflationary universe. Their cosmological and astrophysical origins have been attracting numerous attention. In this Letter, we point out a novel source of ultra-high frequency gravitational waves: the decay of particles produced during the reheating era. We highlight the decay of the Higgs boson as a representative case, showing how it yields a testable gravitational wave spectrum by future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars can be tidally disrupted when passing near a black hole, and the debris can induce a flux of high-energy neutrinos. It has been discussed that there are hints in IceCube data of high-energy neutrinos produced in Tidal Disruption Events. The emitting region of neutrinos and photons in these astrophysical events is likely to be located in the vicinity of the central black hole, where the dark matter density might be significantly larger than in the outer regions of the galaxy. We explore the potential attenuation of the emitted neutrino and photon fluxes due to interactions with dark matter particles around the supermassive black hole of the host galaxies of AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr and AT2019aalc, and study the implications for some well-motivated models of dark matter-neutrino and dark matter-photon interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the complementarity of our constraints with values of the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section proven to alleviate some cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Imprints of light dark matter on the evolution of cosmic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are often considered as a portal to new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and might possess phenomenologically interesting interactions with dark matter (DM). This paper examines the cosmological imprints of DM that interacts with and is produced from SM neutrinos at temperatures below the MeV scale. We take a model-independent approach to compute the evolution of DM in this framework and present analytic results which agree well with numerical ones. Both freeze-in and freeze-out regimes are included in our analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thermal evolution of neutrinos might be substantially affected by their interaction with DM. We highlight two distinctive imprints of such DM on neutrinos: (i) a large, negative contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$, which is close to the current experimental limits and will readily be probed by future experiments; (ii) spectral distortion of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) due to DM annihilating into neutrinos, a potentially important effect for the ongoing experimental efforts to detect C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Hungry or Not: How Stellar-Mass Black Holes Grow (or Don't) in Dark Matter Mini-Haloes at High-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the performance of the popular Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme with a simple mass-flux scheme applied to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) across six levels of increasing spatial resolution. Simulating the formation of black holes within cosmological mini-haloes at $z \sim 20$, we investigate scenarios both with and without supernova events, which result in BHs of initial mass $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ respectively. Our explicit focus on the stellar-mass range pushes the maximum resolution down to sub-$10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$ regimes, where more complicated gas dynamics are resolved. We observe efficient growth and rotationally supported, $\sim$$10^{-1} \, \text{pc}$-scale discs around all $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs independent of resolution and accretion scheme, though clumps, bars, and spiral arm structures impact stability at high resolution. We analyse the effect of these instabilities on the accretion cycle. In contrast, all bar one of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs fail to attract a disc and experience modest growth, even when characteristic scales of accretion and dynamical friction are reasonably resolved. While the two accretion schemes somewhat converge in mass growth for the $270 \, \text{M}_\odot$ case over $1 \, \text{Myr}$, the greater degree of gas fragmentation induces more randomness in the evolution of the $10.8 \, \text{M}_\odot$ BHs. We conclude that early universe black holes of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^1 \, \text{M}_\odot$ struggle to grow even in gas-rich environments without feedback in comparison to seeds of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^2 \, \text{M}_\odot$, and the latter exhibit convergent growth histories across accretion schemes below a spatial resolution of $1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{pc}$.</description>

Abstract: The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker (1999) derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front-back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with the Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way reducing the dynamical friction compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Bubble Misalignment Mechanism for Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of axions at first-order phase transitions in non-Abelian gauge theories. When the duration of the phase transition is short compared to the timescale of the axion oscillations, the axion dynamics is similar to the trapped misalignment mechanism. On the other hand, if this is not the case, the axions are initially expelled from the inside of the bubbles, generating axion waves on the outside. Analogous to the Fermi acceleration, these axions gain energy by repeatedly scattering off the bubble walls. Once they acquire enough energy, they can enter the bubbles. The novel ``bubble misalignment mechanism'' can significantly enhance the axion abundance, compared to models where the axion mass is either constant or varies continuously as a function of temperature. The increase in axion abundance depends on the axion mass, the duration of the phase transition, and the bubble wall velocity. This mechanism results in a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of axions, which could lead to the formation of axion miniclusters. It has potential implications for the formation of oscillons/I-balls, axion warm dark matter, cosmic birefringence, and the production of dark photons.</description>
