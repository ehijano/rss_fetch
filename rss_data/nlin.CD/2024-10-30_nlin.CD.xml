      <title>Overcoming stretching and shortening assumptions in Euler-Bernoulli theory using nonlinear Hencky beam models: applicable to partly-shortened and partly-stretched beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory regarding shortening and stretching assumptions. Certain boundary conditions, such as a cantilever with a horizontal spring attached to its end, result in beams that partly shorten or stretch, depending on the spring stiffness. The traditional Euler-Bernoulli beam model may not accurately capture the geometrical nonlinearity in these cases. To address this, nonlinear Hencky's beam models are proposed to describe such conditions. The validity of these models is assessed against the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli model using the Galerkin method, with examples including cantilever and clamped-clamped configurations representing shortened and stretched beams. An analysis of a cantilever with a horizontal spring, where stiffness varies, using the nonlinear Hencky's model, indicates that increasing horizontal stiffness stiffens the system. This analysis reveals a transition from softening to linear behavior to hardening near the second resonance frequency, suggesting a bifurcation point. Despite the computational demands of nonlinear Hencky's models, this study highlights their effectiveness in overcoming the inherent assumptions of stretching and shortening in Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. These models enable a comprehensive nonlinear analysis of partly shortened or stretched beams.</description>

      <title>Cleaning the beam halo using nonlinear AC magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21895</link>

Abstract: Recently, nonlinear effects have been utilized to cool a special beam represented by an annular distribution in a 2D phase space. This outcome was accomplished using an AC dipole combined with amplitude detuning generated by static nonlinear magnets. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic scenario in which a beam distribution in a 4D phase space includes the presence of a beam halo and demonstrate how the latter can be removed using nonlinear effects. The proposed approach employs high-order nonlinear AC magnets to trap into nonlinear resonances and to perform an adiabatic transport of the beam halo in phase space. Theoretical models will be formulated and examined through numerical simulations to evaluate their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic cycles in fractional generalizations of multidimensional maps</title>

Abstract: In regular dynamics, discrete maps are model presentations of discrete dynamical systems, and they may approximate continuous dynamical systems. Maps are used to investigate general properties of dynamical systems and to model various natural and socioeconomic systems. They are also used in engineering. Many natural and almost all socioeconomic systems possess memory which, in many cases, is power-law-like memory. Generalized fractional maps, in which memory is not exactly the power-law memory but the asymptotically power-law-like memory, are used to model and investigate general properties of these systems. In this paper we extend the definition of the notion of generalized fractional maps of arbitrary positive orders that previously was defined only for maps which, in the case of integer orders, converge to area/volume-preserving maps. Fractional generalizations of H'enon and Lozi maps belong to the newly defined class of generalized fractional maps. We derive the equations which define periodic points in generalized fractional maps. We consider applications of our results to the fractional and fractional difference H'enon and Lozi maps.</description>
