      <title>R\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the Darboux III quantum nonlinear oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the entropic moments and of the R\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.</description>

      <title>Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using Quorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Toward Uncertainty-Aware and Generalizable Neural Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>

      <title>Extended validations on photon number resolving detector based Gaussian boson sampling with low noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a variety of boson sampling overcoming the stable single-photon preparation difficulty of the later. However, like those in the original version, noises in GBS will also result in the deviation of output patterns and the reduction of classical simulation complexity. We extend the pattern recognition validation, together with the correlation approach as a comparison, on GBS using photon number resolving detectors with noises of both photon loss and distinguishability, to quantificationally evaluate noise levels. As for the classical simulation with noises to be used during validations, it is actually a simulation of mixed states where we employ an existing photon-pair strategy to realize polynomial speedup locally. Furthermore, we use an output-binning strategy to realize validation speedup. Our simulation indicates that the pattern recognition protocol is robust on noise evaluations of GBS even when noises are sufficiently low.</description>

      <title>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional detection-loophole-free measurement-device-independent quantum random number generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying random number generators is challenging, especially in security-critical fields like cryptography. Here, we demonstrate a measurement-device-independent quantum random number generator (MDI-QRNG) using high-dimensional photonic path states. Our setup extends the standard qubit beam-splitter QRNG to a three-output version with tunable fiber-optic interferometers acting as tunable beam splitters and superconducting detectors. This setup generates over 1.2 bits per round and 1.77 Mbits per second of certifiably secure private randomness without requiring \emph{any} trust in the measurement apparatus, a critical requirement for the security of real-world cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate certifiably secure high-dimensional quantum random-number generation, paving the way for practical, scalable QRNGs without the need for complex devices.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm to compute entanglement in states with low magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bottleneck for analyzing the interplay between magic and entanglement is the computation of these quantities in highly entangled quantum many-body magic states. Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from random geometrically-two-local Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical hardness-of-sampling results are largely established for random quantum circuits, whereas analog simulators natively realize time evolutions under geometrically local Hamiltonians. Does a typical such Hamiltonian already yield classically-intractable dynamics? We answer this question in the affirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with Gaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a quantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization, necessitating only course-grained control.
  We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We develop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output probabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian evolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage polynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an evaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are trying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from various perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional constraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation distance, under control. We dispense with this step.
  Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation, reduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of the Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding symmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic version of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open problem from the RCS literature. We expect the machinery we develop to find use in average-case Hamiltonian complexity, filling in a gap in this literature which has thus far focussed on worst-case hardness results.</description>

      <title>Blind quantum computing with different qudit resource state architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how blind quantum computing generalizes to multi-level quantum systems (qudits), which offers advantages compared to the qubit approach. Here, a quantum computing task is delegated to an untrusted server while simultaneously preventing the server from retrieving information about the computation it performs, the input, and the output, enabling secure cloud-based quantum computing. In the standard approach with qubits, measurement-based quantum computing is used: single-qubit measurements on cluster or brickwork states implement the computation, while random rotations of the resource qubits hide the computation from the server. We generalize finite-sized approximately universal gate sets to prime-power-dimensional qudits and show that qudit versions of the cluster and brickwork states enable a similar server-blind execution of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we compare the overheads of different resource state architectures and discuss which hiding strategies apply to alternative qudit resource states beyond graph states.</description>

      <title>Classically Sampling Noisy Quantum Circuits in Quasi-Polynomial Time under Approximate Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Composable privacy of networked quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of sensors are a promising scheme to deliver the benefits of quantum technologies in coming years, offering enhanced precision and accuracy for distributed metrology through the use of large entangled states. Recent work has additionally explored the privacy of these schemes, meaning that local parameters can be kept secret while a joint function of these is estimated by the network. In this work, we use the abstract cryptography framework to relate the two proposed definitions of quasi-privacy, showing that both are composable, which enables the protocol to be securely included as a sub-routine to other schemes. We give an explicit example that estimating the mean of a set of parameters using GHZ states is composably fully secure.</description>

      <title>Classical simulation of noisy random circuits from exponential decay of correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems with kinetically constrained dynamics, the Hilbert space can split into exponentially many disconnected subsectors, a phenomenon known as Hilbert-space fragmentation. We study the interplay of such fragmentation with symmetries, focusing on charge conserving systems with charge conjugation and translation symmetries as a concrete example. The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</description>

      <title>Recent quantum runtime (dis)advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We (re)evaluate recent claims of quantum advantage in annealing- and gate-based algorithms, testing whether reported speedups survive rigorous end-to-end runtime definitions and comparison against strong classicalbaselines. Conventional analyses often omit substantial overhead (readout, transpilation, thermalization, etc.) yielding biased assessments. While excluding seemingly not important parts of the simulation may seem reasonable, on most current quantum hardware a clean separation between "pure compute" and "overhead" cannot be experimentally justified. This may distort "supremacy" results. In contrast, for most classical hardware total time $\approx$ compute $+$ a weakly varying constant leading to robust claims.
  We scrutinize two important milestones: (1) quantum annealing for approximate QUBO [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.160601], which uses a sensible time-to-$\epsilon$ metric but proxies runtime by the annealing time (non-measurable); (2) a restricted Simon's problem [https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.021082] , whose advantageous scaling in oracle calls is undisputed; yet, as we demonstrate, estimated runtime of the quantum experiment is $\sim 100 \times$ slower than a tuned classical baseline. Finally, we show that recently claimed "runtime advantage" of the BF-DCQO hybrid algorithm (arXiv:2505.08663) does not withstand rigorous benchmarking. Therefore, we conclude that runtime-based supremacy remains elusive on NISQ hardware, and credible claims require a careful time accounting with a proper reference selections, and an adequate metric.</description>

      <title>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Noisy Geometrically Local Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for almost 30 years that quantum circuits with interspersed depolarizing noise converge to the uniform distribution at $\omega(\log n)$ depth, where $n$ is the number of qubits, making them classically simulable. We show that under the realistic constraint of geometric locality, this bound is loose: these circuits become classically simulable at even shallower depths. Unlike prior work in this regime, we consider sampling from worst-case circuits and noise of any constant strength. First, we prove that the output distribution of any noisy geometrically local quantum circuit can be approximately sampled from in quasipolynomial time, when its depth exceeds a fixed $\Theta(\log n)$ critical threshold which depends on the noise strength. This scaling in $n$ was previously only obtained for noisy random quantum circuits (Aharonov et. al, STOC 2023). We further conjecture that our bound is still loose and that a $\Theta(1)$-depth threshold suffices for simulability due to a percolation effect. To support this, we provide analytical evidence together with a candidate efficient algorithm. Our results rely on new information-theoretic properties of the output states of noisy shallow quantum circuits, which may be of broad interest. On a fundamental level, we demonstrate that unitary quantum processes in constant dimensions are more fragile to noise than previously understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating extensive combinations of local parameters in distributed quantum systems is a central problem in quantum sensing, with applications ranging from magnetometry to timekeeping. While optimal strategies are known for sensing non-interacting Hamiltonians in quantum sensor networks, fundamental limits in the presence of uncontrolled interactions remain unclear. Here, we establish optimal bounds and protocols for estimating a linear combination of local parameters of Hamiltonians with arbitrary, unknown interactions. In the process, we more generally establish bounds for learning any linear combination of Hamiltonian coefficients for arbitrary, commuting terms. Our results unify and extend existing bounds for non-interacting qubits and multimode interferometers, providing a general framework for distributed sensing and Hamiltonian learning in realistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Environmental Noise for Quantum Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hardware increasingly relies on energy reserves that can later be converted into useful work; yet, most battery-like proposals demand coherent drives or engineered non-equilibrium resources, limiting practicality in noisy settings. We develop an autonomous charging paradigm in which an ensemble of identical two-level units, collectively coupled to a thermal environment, acquires work capacity without any external control. The common bath mediates interference between emission and absorption pathways, steering the many-body state away from passivity and into a steady regime with nonzero extractable work. The full charging dynamics and closed-form expressions are obtained for the steady-state, showing favorable scaling with the number of cells that approach the many-body optimum. We show that the mechanism is robust to local noise: under a convex mixture of collective and local dissipation, non-zero steady-state ergotropy persists, exhibits counterintuitive finite-temperature optima, and remains operative when the collective channel is comparable to or stronger than the local one. We show that environmental fluctuations can be harnessed to realize drive-free, scalable quantum batteries compatible with circuit- and cavity-QED platforms. Used as local work buffers, such batteries could potentially enable rapid ancilla reset, bias dissipative stabilizer pumps, and reduce syndrome-extraction overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise.
  Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Mereological Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the novel concept of mereological quantum phase transition (m-QPTs). Our framework is based on a variational family of operator algebras defining generalized tensor product structures (g-TPS), a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian, and a quantum scrambling functional. By minimizing the scrambling functional, one selects a g-TPS, enabling a pullback of the natural information-geometric metric on the g-TPS manifold to the parameter space. The singularities of this induced metric -- so-called algebra susceptibility -- in the thermodynamic limit characterize the m-QPTs. We illustrate this framework through analytical examples involving quantum coherence and operator entanglement. Moreover, spin-chains numerical simulations show susceptibility sharp responses at an integrability point and strong growth across disorder-induced localization, suggesting critical reorganizations of emergent subsystem structure aligned with those transitions.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits offer significant advantages over qubit-based architectures, including more efficient gate compilation, reduced resource requirements, improved error-correction primitives, and enhanced capabilities for quantum communication and cryptography. Yet, one of the most promising family of quantum error correction codes, namely quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, have been so far mostly restricted to qubits. Here, we generalize recent advancements in LDPC codes from qubits to qudits. We introduce a general framework for finding qudit LDPC codes and apply our formalism to several promising types of LDPC codes. We generalize bivariate bicycle codes, including their coprime variant; hypergraph product codes, including the recently proposed La-cross codes; subsystem hypergraph product (SHYPS) codes; high-dimensional expander codes, which make use of Ramanujan complexes; and fiber bundle codes. Using the qudit generalization formalism, we then numerically search for and decode several novel qudit codes compatible with near-term hardware. Our results highlight the potential of qudit LDPC codes as a versatile and hardware-compatible pathway toward scalable quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian states via pump-depleted SPDC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model for non-Gaussian state generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in InGaP microring resonators. The nonlinear Hamiltonian is written in terms of the asymptotic fields for the system, which includes a phantom channel to handle scattering loss. The full ket for the system is written as a Gaussian unitary acting on a residual non-Gaussian ket, which is vacuum initially and evolves according to a non-Gaussian Hamiltonian. We show that for realistic parameters we can access the pump depletion regime, where the Wigner function for the residual non-Gaussian ket has negativity. But we find that the non-Gaussian features for the full ket could be unobservable due to the large amount of squeezing required to lead to pump depletion. We show that a potential solution in the low-loss regime is to implement an inverse Gaussian unitary on the accessible modes to remove most of the squeezing and reveal the non-Gaussian features. This work provides a foundation for modeling pump-depleted SPDC in integrated lossy microring resonators, opening a path toward a scalable on-chip non-Gaussian source.</description>

      <title>On the Pure Quantum Polynomial Hierarchy and Quantified Hamiltonian Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several new results concerning the pure quantum polynomial hierarchy (pureQPH). First, we show that QMA(2) is contained in pureQSigma2, that is, two unentangled existential provers can be simulated by competing existential and universal provers. We further prove that pureQSigma2 is contained in QSigma3, which in turn is contained in NEXP.
  Second, we give an error reduction result for pureQPH, and, as a consequence, prove that pureQPH = QPH. A key ingredient in this result is an improved dimension-independent disentangler.
  Finally, we initiate the study of quantified Hamiltonian complexity, the quantum analogue of quantified Boolean formulae. We prove that the quantified pure sparse Hamiltonian problem is pureQSigma-complete. By contrast, other natural variants (pure/local, mixed/local, and mixed/sparse) admit nontrivial containments but fail to be complete under known techniques. For example, we show that the exists-forall mixed local Hamiltonian problem lies in NP^QMA \cap coNP^QMA.</description>

      <title>Approximate maximum likelihood decoding with $K$ minimum weight matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.</description>

      <title>CLAQS: Compact Learnable All-Quantum Token Mixer with Shared-ansatz for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum compute is scaling fast, from cloud QPUs to high throughput GPU simulators, making it timely to prototype quantum NLP beyond toy tasks. However, devices remain qubit limited and depth limited, training can be unstable, and classical attention is compute and memory heavy. This motivates compact, phase aware quantum token mixers that stabilize amplitudes and scale to long sequences. We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Optimal filtering and generation of entangled photons for quantum applications in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtering is commonly used in quantum optics to reject noise photons, and also to enable interference between independent photons. However, filtering the joint spectrum of photon pairs can reduce the inherent coincidence probability or loss-independent heralding efficiency. Here, we investigate filtering for multiphoton applications based on entanglement and interference (e.g., quantum teleportation). We multiplex C-band entangled photons and C-band classical communications into the same long-distance fibers, which enables scalable low-loss quantum networking but requires filtering of spontaneous Raman scattering noise from classical light. Using tunable-bandwidth filters, low-jitter detectors, and polarization filters, we co-propagate time-bin-entangled photons at wavelengths compatible with erbium-ion quantum memories (1536.5 nm) and 10-Gbps C-band classical data over 25 km/25 km of standard fiber. Narrow filtering enables mW-level C-band power, which exceeds comparable studies by roughly an order of magnitude and could feasibly support Tbps classical rates. We evaluate how performance depends on pump and filter bandwidths, multipair emission, filter shapes, loss, phase matching, and how quantum information is measured. We find a trade-off between improving noise impact and single-mode purity and discuss mitigation methods toward optimal multiphoton applications. Importantly, these results apply to noise in free space and in quantum devices (sources, frequency converters, switches, detectors, etc.) and provide insight on filter-induced degradation of single-photon purity and rates even in noise-free environments.</description>

      <title>Adapting Quantum Machine Learning for Energy Dissociation of Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) underpins mechanistic insight and the rational design of molecules and materials. We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Insulator and Possible Superfluid Based on Two-Dimensional Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on excitonic insulator has progressed mainly based on narrow bandgap semiconductor or semimetal. Herein, we realize excitonic insulator based on two-dimensional (2D) wide band gap diamond with transition temperature as high as 220K. The resistance rises dramatically by more than three orders, which can be explained by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. While cooling down below transition temperature, the wavelength of the bound excitons caused by boron and nitrogen centers becomes highly overlapped, leading to BEC process. Furthermore, the variable range hopping mechanism is used to simulate the resistance as a function of temperature, which reveals the formation of excitonic insulator. When temperature drops down further, a sudden drop of resistance over three orders was observed around 60K, possibly due to the formation of non-equilibrium excitonic superfluid resulting from highly overlap of wavelength of the large density bound excitons at lower temperature. This study provides evidences for excitonic insulator and possible superfluid phase based on wide bandgap semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Hyperinvariant Spin Network States -- An AdS/CFT Model from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry Codes and Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) defines a duality that pairs decoding problems with optimization problems. The original work on DQI considered Reed-Solomon decoding, whose dual optimization problem, called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a finite field. Here, we consider a class of algebraic geometry codes called Hermitian codes, which achieve block length $q^3$ using alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ compared to Reed-Solomon's limitation to block length $q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, requiring approximately one-third fewer qubits per field element for quantum implementations. We show that the dual optimization problem, which we call Hermitian Optimal Polynomial Intersection (HOPI), is a polynomial regression problem over a Hermitian curve, and because the dual to a Hermitian code is another Hermitian code, the HOPI problem can also be viewed as approximate list recovery for Hermitian codes. By comparing to Prange's algorithm, simulated annealing, and algebraic list recovery algorithms, we find a large parameter regime in which DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation than these classical algorithms, suggesting that the apparent quantum speedup offered by DQI extends beyond Reed-Solomon codes to a broader class of polynomial regression problems on algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Postselected amplification and photon recycling applied to optical sensing of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the combined technique of postselected amplification and photon-recycling to an optical setup of magnetic field precision measurement. We propose two recycling schemes and carry out analytic expressions for the amplified signal and measurement sensitivity. The results show significant improvement of performance over conventional measurement. The underlying reason is twofold. On one aspect, introducing the technique of recycling eliminates the shortcoming of data discarding in postselection, thus maintains similar noise level of conventional measurement (without postselection). On the other aspect, performing intentional postselection within the recycling framework, which was originally proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection, can amplify the signal. Thus, the measurement signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced.</description>

      <title>Layer codes as partially self-correcting quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate layer codes, a family of three-dimensional stabilizer codes that can achieve optimal scaling of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier, as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. First, we introduce two decoding algorithms for layer codes with provable guarantees for local stochastic and adversarial noise, respectively. We then prove that layer codes constitute partially self-correcting quantum memories which outperform previously analyzed models such as the cubic code and the welded solid code. Notably, we argue that partial self-correction without the requirement of efficient decoding is more common than expected, as it arises solely from a diverging energy barrier. This draws a sharp distinction between partially self-correcting systems and partially self-correcting memories. Another novel aspect of our work is an analysis of layer codes constructed from random Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We show that these random layer codes have optimal scaling (up to logarithmic corrections) of code parameters and a polynomial energy barrier. Finally, we present numerical studies of their memory times and report behavior consistent with partial self-correction.</description>

      <title>State preparation and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of symmetries in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to prepare the ground or specific low-lying states of quantum Hamiltonians. We examine two spin problems, one with random all-to-all couplings inspired by neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae, and the standard Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian on a $4 \times 3$ lattice. The neutrino Hamiltonian has the total spin $J$ and third component $J_{\rm{z}}$ as its only symmetries. The Heisenberg model has these symmetries plus translational invariance and reflection symmetry.
  We demonstrate that the convergence of variational methods is dramatically improved by keeping all symmetries. In both cases a nearly exact solution can be obtained in cases where standard unconstrained variational algorithms fail. Since variational algorithms can use standard Trotter steps as part of the optimization, allowing additional correlations that obey all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian will speed convergence of variational algorithms. This will lead to faster convergence than standard projection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Continuous measurement-based holonomic quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate holonomies using the Quantum Zeno effect, enabling logical unitary operations on quantum stabilizer codes purely through measurements. The quantum error-correcting code space is adiabatically rotated by measuring a succession of rotated stabilizer generators. When the rotation is sufficiently slow, the state remains confined to the instantaneous code space by the Zeno effect; otherwise, measurement-induced jumps can occur into a rotated orthogonal subspace. If the rotation completes a closed loop, the code state is transformed by a holonomy: a logical unitary transformation. We analytically derive the sequence of rotated stabilizer generators that produce a desired holonomy, and find the total time required to implement this procedure with a given success probability. If a measurement moves the state to the orthogonal subspace, we present a method to alter the path of the rotated observables to return the state either to the original code or the original error space with the desired holonomy; in the latter case, the holonomy is emulated. Finally, we establish conditions on the code and the measured observables that preserve the correctability of a given error set. When a code fails to meet the error-correcting conditions, our protocol remains applicable by augmenting the code with at most two ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large repeater chains ($N&gt;512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.</description>

      <title>Fast-forwardable Lindbladians imply quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Lindbladian dynamics are both foundational in quantum information science and central to quantum algorithm design. In this work, we bridge these two concepts: certain simple Lindbladian processes can be adapted to perform QPE-type tasks. However, unlike QPE, which achieves Heisenberg-limit scaling, these Lindbladian evolutions are restricted to standard quantum limit complexity. This indicates that, different from Hamiltonian dynamics, the natural dissipative evolution speed of such Lindbladians does not saturate the fundamental quantum limit, thereby suggesting the potential for quadratic fast-forwarding. We confirm this by presenting a quantum algorithm that simulates these Lindbladians for time $t$ within an error $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{t\log(\varepsilon^{-1})}\right)$ cost, whose mechanism is fundamentally different from the fast-forwarding examples of Hamiltonian dynamics. As a bonus, this fast-forwarded simulation naturally serves as a new Heisenberg-limit QPE algorithm. Therefore, our work explicitly bridges the standard quantum limit-Heisenberg limit transition to the fast-forwarding of dissipative dynamics. We also adopt our fast-forwarding algorithm for efficient Gibbs state preparation and demonstrate the counter-intuitive implication: the allowance of a quadratically accelerated decoherence effect under arbitrary Pauli noise.</description>

      <title>Constant-Overhead Addressable Gates via Single-Shot Code Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many quantum fault-tolerance schemes.
  We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation. Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions.
  Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of 2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Guarantees of Variational Quantum Algorithm with Guiding States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are prominent candidates for near-term quantum advantage but lack rigorous guarantees of convergence and generalization. By contrast, quantum phase estimation (QPE) provides provable performance under the guiding state assumption, where access to a state with non-trivial overlap with the ground state enables efficient energy estimation. In this work, we ask whether similar guarantees can be obtained for VQAs. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm with guiding states aiming towards predicting ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. We then develop a proof technique-the linearization trick-that maps the training dynamics of the algorithm to those of a kernel model. This connection yields the first theoretical guarantees on both convergence and generalization for the VQA under the guiding state assumption. Our analysis shows that guiding states accelerate convergence, suppress finite-size error terms, and ensure stability across system dimensions. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on 2D random Heisenberg models.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Treewidth Barrier in Quantum Circuit Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a critical tool for validating quantum hardware and probing the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</description>

      <title>Near-Asymptotically-Good Quantum Codes with Transversal CCZ Gates and Sublinear-Weight Parity-Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance.
  We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements.
  As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi &amp; Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Methods for Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computing in enhancing malware detection through the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Our main objective is to investigate the performance of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm compared to SVM. A publicly available dataset containing raw binaries of Portable Executable (PE) files was used for the classification. The QSVM algorithm, incorporating quantum kernels through different feature maps, was implemented and evaluated on a local simulator within the Qiskit SDK and IBM quantum computers. Experimental results from simulators and quantum hardware provide insights into the behavior and performance of quantum computers, especially in handling large-scale computations for malware detection tasks. The work summarizes the practical experience with using quantum hardware via the Qiskit interfaces. We describe in detail the critical issues encountered, as well as the fixes that had to be developed and applied to the base code of the Qiskit Machine Learning library. These issues include missing transpilation of the circuits submitted to IBM Quantum systems and exceeding the maximum job size limit due to the submission of all the circuits in one job.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Linear Systems Pathway for Solving Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Reconquering Bell sampling on qudits: stabilizer learning and testing, quantum pseudorandomness bounds, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d &gt; 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms. Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Mirrored Entanglement Witnesses for Multipartite and High-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are a versatile tool to detect entangled states and characterize related properties of entanglement in quantum information theory. A witness $W$ corresponds to an observable satisfying $\mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0$ for all separable states $\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}$; entangled states are detected once the inequality is violated. Recently, mirrored EWs have been introduced by showing that there exist non-trivial upper bounds to EWs, \begin{eqnarray} u_W\geq \mathrm{tr}[W\sigma_{\mathrm{sep}}]\geq 0. \nonumber \end{eqnarray} An upper bound to a witness $W$ signifies the existence of the other one $M$, called a mirrored EW, such that $W+M = u_W I \otimes I$. The framework of mirrored EWs shows that a single EW can be even more useful, as it can detect a larger set of entangled states by lower and upper bounds.
  In this work, we develop and investigate mirrored EWs for multipartite qubit states and also for high-dimensional systems, to find the efficiency and effectiveness of mirrored EWs in detecting entangled states. We provide mirrored EWs for $n$-partite GHZ states, graph states such as two-colorable states, and tripartite bound entangled states. We also show that optimal EWs can be reflected with each other. For bipartite systems, we present mirrored EWs for existing optimal EWs and also construct a mirrored pair of optimal EWs in dimension three. Finally, we generalize mirrored EWs such that a pair of EWs can be connected by another EW, i.e., $W+M =K$ is also an EW. Our results enhance the capability of EWs to detect a larger set of entangled states in multipartite and high-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of quantum Darwinism and pointer states for non-commuting evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems achieve objectivity by redundantly encoding information about themselves into the surrounding environment, through a mechanism known as quantum Darwinism. When this happens, observes measure the environment and infer the system to be in one of its pointer states. We study the emergence of objectivity whenever the Hamiltonian of the system and the interaction Hamiltonian between system and environment do not commute, a condition which is thought to be incompatible with the presence of pointer states. We show that, not only non-commuting evolutions allow for the emergence of objective states, but it is possible to give a more relaxed definition of pointer states, that is always well defined whenever there is redundancy of information, and coincides with the usual one for commuting evolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing that incorporates strong single-photon nonlinearities into a photonic GHZ-measurement-based architecture. The nonlinearities substantially reduce resource overheads compared to conventional linear-optics-based architectures, which require significant redundancy to accommodate probabilistic photon generation and probabilistic entangling operations. By removing linear-optical failure modes, our nonlinear architecture can also tolerate much higher optical losses than linear approaches, with a baseline loss tolerance of $\sim$12\% using a 32-photon resource state and a foliated surface code. Our results show how introducing a nonlinear primitive enables dramatic improvements in practical implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LOCC Protocols on Product Stiefel Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local operations and classical communication (LOCC) is a foundational framework in quantum information from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. However, designing and optimizing LOCC protocols is intractable due to their complex structure. Determining achievable bounds and designing practically implementable LOCC protocols remain crucial challenges when the number of communication rounds is finite. In this work, we develop a framework to optimize fixed-round LOCC via Riemannian optimization on the product Stiefel manifold, which not only yields near-optimal objective function values but also produces fully implementable protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through key tasks in quantum information processing, such as entanglement distillation and state merging. Our results provide new insights into the achievable bounds for entanglement distillation and block entanglement state merging. We obtain improved distillation and state merging protocols, some of which match the upper bounds derived via positive partial transpose relaxations. These results demonstrate that optimizing LOCC via manifold optimization can serve as a powerful tool to advance research on distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational results in theoretical computer science have established that everything provable, is provable in zero knowledge. However, this assertion fundamentally assumes a classical interpretation of computation and many interesting physical statements that one can hope to prove are not characterized. In this work, we consider decision problems, where the problem instance itself is specified by a (pure) quantum state. We discuss several motivating examples for this notion and, as our main technical result, we show that every quantum problem that is provable with an interactive protocol, is also provable in zero-knowledge. Our protocol achieves unconditional soundness and computational zero-knowledge, under standard assumptions in cryptography. In addition, we show how our techniques yield a protocol for the Uhlmann transformation problem that achieves a meaningful notion of zero-knowledge, also in the presence of a malicious verifier.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sparse Recovery and Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how to assign internal energy, heat, and work in quantum systems beyond weak coupling remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics, particularly as the difference between competing definitions becomes increasingly relevant. We identify two common sets of definitions for first-law quantities that are used to describe the thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to thermal environments. Both are conceptually non-symmetric, treating one part of the bipartition (the "system") differently from the other (the "bath"). We analyze these in a setting where such roles are not easily assigned - two large (but finite) sets of thermal harmonic oscillators interacting with each other. We further compare them with a third set of definitions based on a local, conceptually symmetric open-system approach ("minimal dissipation") and discuss their quantitative and structural differences. In particular, we observe that all three sets of definitions differ substantially even when the two subsystems are weakly coupled and far detuned, and that the minimal dissipation approach features distinct work peaks that increase with the coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Expressive and Scalable Quantum Fusion for Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential. The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing in spin-based architectures necessitates the a bility to reliably shuttle quantum states across extended device regions with minimal decoherence. In this work, we present a physics-informed algorithm for optimizing electrostatic bias equences that enable conveyor-mode electron transport in silicon-based quantum dot devices. Our approach combines self-consistent Poisson and Schrodinger solvers to maintain a constant ground state energy and enable near-constant velocity shuttling, with potential applicability to both single-electron and hole transport. We validate the algorithm across three representative technologies: Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI), Silicon Metal-Oxide-Seminconductor (SiMOS) and Silicon-Germanium Heterostracture (Si/SiGe), highlighting key limitations and material-specific effects that influence transport fidelity. Our findings underscore the impact of gate geometry, dielectric interfaces, and quantum dot size on the stability of shuttling operations, and offer pathways toward improving coherence preservation in large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unitary Quantum Cellular Automata for Density Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the density classification task (DCT) -- determining the majority bit in a one-dimensional binary lattice -- within a quantum cellular automaton (CA) framework. While there is no one-dimensional two-state, radius $r \geq 1$, deterministic CA with periodic boundary conditions that solves the DCT perfectly, we explore whether a unitary quantum model can succeed. We employ the Partitioned Unitary Quantum Cellular Automaton (PUQCA), a number-conserving model, and, via evolutionary search, find solutions to the DCT where the success condition is stipulated in terms of measurement probabilities rather than convergence to fixed-point configurations. Finally, we identify a classically simulable regime of the PUQCA in which we find rules that solve the DCT at fixed system sizes and analyze their performance.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of the homology problem with orientable filtration: MA-completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of an MA-complete homology problem for a certain subclass of simplicial complexes. The problem is defined through a new concept of orientability of simplicial complexes that we call a "uniform orientable filtration", which is related to sign-problem freeness in homology. The containment in MA is achieved through the design of new, higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes associated with the filtration. For the MA-hardness, we design a new gadget with which we can reduce from an MA-hard stoquastic satisfiability problem. Therefore, our result provides the first natural MA-complete problem for higher-order random walks on simplicial complexes, combining the concepts of topology, persistent homology, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Modular interface for efficient optical readout of diamond quantum memory at cryogenic temperatures via single-mode optical fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum devices across various physical systems have been rapidly developed for entanglement-based quantum repeaters and spin-photon conversion; however, far less attention has been paid to standardizing platforms through quantum memory optical interfaces. We present a modular interface for color centers in diamond that is structurally isolated from device-and temperature-related variation. Despite a more than 100-fold reduction in confocal volume, we achieve highly efficient photon collection through single-mode optical fibers, including zero-phonon line spectroscopy, at both room and cryogenic temperatures. These results establish a standardized minimal NV-center-based platform and pave the way for construction of scalable quantum infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Software Framework for Optically Accessible Quantum Memory Using Group-IV Color Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum technology, the precise and detailed description of quantum components is not just a necessity but the foundation for advancing research, development, and applications. Optically accessible quantum memories are key building blocks for devices such as quantum repeaters and two-factor authentication. The memory we describe here is based on a tin-vacancy color center coupled to a highly efficient cavity. It leverages state-dependent reflection from the cavity and implements high-fidelity fractional single qubit gates via a train of optical $\pi/8$ pulses. We also describe its operation under microwave control, further extending our analysis. Our primary contribution in this work is the integration of this device model into a standardized software framework for quantum memory architectures.</description>

      <title>A Duality Theorem for Classical-Quantum States with Applications to Complete Relational Program Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</description>

      <title>High-Performance Imaging in a Dilution Refrigerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic light-matter interfaces hold great promise for quantum technologies. Enhancing local electromagnetic fields, they enable highly efficient detectors, can help realize optically connected processors, or serve as quantum repeaters. In-situ fiber-coupling at sub-Kelvin temperatures, as required for test and development of new devices, proves challenging as suitable cryogenic microscopes are not readily available. Here, we report on a robust and versatile confocal imaging system integrated in a dilution refrigerator, enabling high-resolution visualization of nanophotonic structures on a transparent diamond substrate. Our imaging system achieves a resolution of 1.1 {\mu}m and a field-of-view of 2.5 mm. The system requires no movable parts at cryogenic temperatures and features a large working distance, thereby allowing optical and microwave probe access, as well as direct anchoring of temperature sensitive samples to a cold finger, needed for applications with high thermal load. This system will facilitate the development of scalable, integrated quantum optics technology, as required for research on large scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Potential of multi-anomalies detection using quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintenance of production equipment is critical in manufacturing. Typically, machine learning models are trained on sensor data closely attached to equipment. However, as the number of machines increases, computational cost grows rapidly. In practice, anomalies are often identified by human operators through auditory perception, relying heavily on experience and intuition. In vibration analysis, especially, AR model coefficients combined with one-class SVMs are used for detecting anomalies. In this work, we explore the effect of substituting the classical kernel in the one-class SVM with a quantum kernel. Two experimental setups were used. The first involved a miniature racing car track, where the car passes over a patch of hook-and-loop fastener to generate abnormal sounds, which are recorded using a microphone. The second involved an open-belt drive, where chopsticks are inserted at specific times to produce crushing sounds, simulating sudden anomalies. Our results show a clear advantage of quantum kernels over classical Gaussian (RBF) kernels. On the miniature car track dataset, the quantum kernel achieved an accuracy and F1-score of 0.82, compared to 0.64 and 0.39 respectively for the RBF kernel. For the crushing device, the quantum kernel achieved perfect accuracy and F1-score (1.00), while the RBF kernel reached only 0.64 accuracy and 0.43 F1-score. These findings suggest that quantum kernels enhance the classification accuracy for diverse types of abnormal sound patterns, including both periodic and impulsive anomalies.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced two-axis spin squeezing with decoherence reduction in hybrid spin-optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to implement Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing in a hybrid cavity optomechanical-spin system. In our system, $N$ two-level systems are coupled via Tavis-Cummings interactions to a mechanical resonator (MR) in a standard optomechanical setup. Within the dispersive coupling regime, adiabatic elimination of the optical mode induces a squeezing effect on the MR, which, in the squeezed representation, effectively transforms the collective spin operators into a Bogoliubov form. Under large detuning conditions, the phonon mode mediates interactions among the Bogoliubov collective spins, thereby enabling a two-axis twisting squeezing protocol through appropriate parameter tuning. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that in the presence of dephasing and phonon dissipation, the maximum squeezing degree asymptotically converges to a constant as $N$ increases, which implies the metrological precision asymptotically approaches the standard quantum limit without parameter optimization. Nevertheless, in parameter optimization we extract a scaling relation of the optimal squeezing which surpasses existing schemes in the literature. Moreover, the optimization also leads to a considerable reduction of the preparation time for the optimal squeezing. Our work may provide insights into dissipation effects in spin squeezing and offer a potential route for high-precision quantum metrology in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of quantum protocols. This result shows a canonical circuit decomposition of a $(G \times H)$-invariant quantum comb for compact groups $G$ and $H$ using the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan transforms, which naturally extends to the $G$-covariant quantum comb. By using this circuit decomposition, we propose a parametrized quantum comb with group symmetry, and derive the optimal quantum comb which transforms an unknown unitary operation $U \in \mathrm{SU}(d)$ to its inverse $U^\dagger$ or transpose $U^\top$. From numerics, we find a deterministic and exact unitary transposition protocol for $d=3$ with $7$ queries to $U$. This protocol improves upon the protocol shown in the previous work, which requires $13$ queries to $U$.</description>

      <title>HPQEA: A Scalable and High-Performance Quantum Emulator with High-Bandwidth Memory for Diverse Algorithms Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of quantum emulation. However, existing studies often struggle to achieve broad applicability, high performance, and efficient resource and memory utilization. To address these challenges, we provide HPQEA, a quantum emulator based on the state-vector emulation approach. HPQEA includes three main features: a high-performance computing core, an optimized controlled-NOT gate computation strategy, and effective utilization of high-bandwidth memory. Verification and evaluation on the Alveo U280 board show that HPQEA can emulate quantum circuits with up to 30 qubits while maintaining high fidelity and low mean square error. It outperforms comparable FPGA-based systems by producing faster execution, supporting a wider range of algorithms, and requiring low hardware resources. Furthermore, it exceeds the Nvidia A100 in normalized gate speed for systems with up to 20 qubits. These results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of HPQEA as a platform for emulating quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: A user, Alice, wants to get server Bob to implement a quantum computation for her. However, she wants to leave him blind to what she's doing. What are the minimal communication resources Alice must use in order to achieve information-theoretic security? In this paper, we consider a single step of the protocol, where Alice conveys to Bob whether or not he should implement a specific gate. We use an entropy-bounding technique to quantify the minimum number of qubits that Alice must send so that Bob cannot learn anything about the gate being implemented. We provide a protocol that saturates this bound. In this optimal protocol, the states that Alice sends may be entangled. For Clifford gates, we prove that it is sufficient for Alice to send separable states.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Quality Bound on Optical Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sending quantum information reliably over long distances is a central challenge in quantum technology in general, and in quantum optics in particular, since most quantum communication relies on optical fibres or free-space links. Here, we address this problem by shifting the focus from the quantity of information sent to the quality of the transmission, i.e. the rate of decay of the transmission error with respect to the number of channel uses. For the general class of teleportation-simulable channels, which includes all channels arising in quantum optical communication, we prove that the single-letter reverse relative entropy of entanglement of the Choi state upper bounds the error exponent of two-way assisted quantum communication - paralleling the celebrated capacity bound of [Pirandola et al., Nat. Comm. (2017)] in terms of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Remarkably, for Gaussian channels our bound can be computed efficiently through a convex program with simple constraints involving only finite-dimensional covariance matrices. As a prototypical application, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for several one-mode Gaussian channels that are fundamental to optical communication. Extending recent work [Lami et al., arXiv:2408.07067 (2024)] to infinite-dimensional systems, we further endow the reverse relative entropy of entanglement with an exact operational interpretation in entanglement testing, and show that it characterises the rate of entanglement distillation under non-entangling operations. These findings offer a new perspective on entanglement as a resource and sharpen the theoretical benchmarks for future quantum optical networks.</description>

      <title>Preparation of initial states with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices using matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of genuine quantum information transmission through completely depolarizing channels in a superposition of cyclic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum communication is addressing the negative effects of noise on channel capacity, especially for completely depolarizing channels, where information transmission is inherently impossible. The concept of indefinite causal order provides a promising solution by allowing control over the sequence in which channels are applied. We experimentally demonstrate the activation of quantum communication through completely depolarizing channels using a programmable silicon photonic quantum chip. By implementing configurations based on the superposition of cyclic orders, a form of indefinite causal order, we report the first experimental realization of genuine quantum information transmission across multiple concatenated completely depolarizing channels. Our results show that when four completely depolarizing channels are combined using the superposition of cyclic orders, the fidelity of the output state is $0.712 \pm 0.013$, significantly exceeding the classical threshold of 2/3. Our work establishes indefinite causal order as a powerful tool for overcoming noise-induced limitations in quantum communication, demonstrating its potential in high-noise environments and opening new possibilities for building robust quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Entangling remote qubits through a two-mode squeezed reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated superconducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Haar random codes attain the quantum Hamming bound, approximately</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the error correcting properties of Haar random codes, in which a $K$-dimensional code space $\boldsymbol{C} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N$ is chosen at random from the Haar distribution. Our main result is that Haar random codes can approximately correct errors up to the quantum Hamming bound, meaning that a set of $m$ Pauli errors can be approximately corrected so long as $mK \ll N$. This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24]. Our proof relies on a recent matrix concentration result of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and van Handel.</description>

      <title>MIPco=coRE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, a landmark result by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen showed that MIP*, the class of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple computationally unbounded provers sharing entanglement in the tensor product model, is equal to RE. We show that the class MIPco, a complexity class defined similarly to MIP* except with provers sharing the commuting operator model of entanglement, is equal to the class coRE. This shows that giving the provers two different models of entanglement leads to two completely different computational powers for interactive proof systems. Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of MIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that the same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property in the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the compression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous framework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli basis test introduced by de la Salle [ArXiv:2204.07084].
  We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which we call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco satisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish that the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified framework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this approach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not rely on the preservation of the entanglement bound. In addition to non-local games, this new condition could also potentially be applicable to other decision problems.</description>

      <title>Clifford testing: algorithms and lower bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Clifford testing, which asks whether a black-box $n$-qubit unitary is a Clifford unitary or at least $\varepsilon$-far from every Clifford unitary. We give the first 4-query Clifford tester, which decides this problem with probability $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$. This contrasts with the minimum of 6 copies required for the closely-related task of stabilizer testing. We show that our tester is tolerant, by adapting techniques from tolerant stabilizer testing to our setting. In doing so, we settle in the positive a conjecture of Bu, Gu and Jaffe, by proving a polynomial inverse theorem for a non-commutative Gowers 3-uniformity norm. We also consider the restricted setting of single-copy access, where we give an $O(n)$-query Clifford tester that requires no auxiliary memory qubits or adaptivity. We complement this with a lower bound, proving that any such, potentially adaptive, single-copy algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ queries. To obtain our results, we leverage the structure of the commutant of the Clifford group, obtaining several technical statements that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Costs of Noise-Robust Quantum Control: Speed Limits and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is ubiquitous in quantum systems and is a major obstacle for the advancement of quantum information science. Noise-robust quantum control achieves high-fidelity operations by engineering the evolution path so that first-order noise contributions cancel at the final time. Such dynamical error correction typically incurs a time overhead beyond standard quantum speed limits. We derive general lower bounds on control complexity that quantify this overhead for quasi-static coherent noise under bounded control amplitude. For a single noise source, we prove a universal time lower bound for first-order robustness and give a constructive scheme that implements any target gate robustly in time 4T plus a constant time. For robustness against an entire noise space, we show dimension lower bounds on the number M of segments in any mixed-unitary schedule from two mechanism: (i) a coherent dimension bound when the error subspace contains an irreducible block isomorphic to su(q), and (ii) a projection dimension bound when the noise space contains the trace-zero span of orthogonal projectors. Under bounded speed, these bounds on number of segments imply time lower bounds. With only local controls robust against noise space defined on a graph, we obtain a graph-orthogonality time bound scales linear with graph chromatic number. We illustrate the bounds through examples. Collectively, these results establish quantitative limitations on the feasibility of first-order noise-resilient operations.</description>

      <title>Covert Quantum Learning: Privately and Verifiably Learning from Quantum Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii) target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d. ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Inference for Multilayer Neural Networks with Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) promise to deliver exponential speed-ups in select computational tasks, yet their integration into modern deep learning pipelines remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this gap by presenting the first fully-coherent quantum implementation of a multilayer neural network with non-linear activation functions. Our constructions mirror widely used deep learning architectures based on ResNet, and consist of residual blocks with multi-filter 2D convolutions, sigmoid activations, skip-connections, and layer normalizations. We analyse the complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes. Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers, and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of $\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over two decades ago, Bruce Kane proposed that spin-half phosphorus nuclei embedded in a spin-zero silicon substrate could serve as a viable platform for spin-based quantum computing. These nuclear spins exhibit remarkably long coherence times, making them ideal candidates for qubits. Despite this advantage, practical realisation of spin quantum computing remains a challenge. More recently, physicist Matthew Fisher proposed a hypothesis linking nuclear spin dynamics, specifically those of phosphorus nuclei within the spin-zero matrix of calcium phosphate molecules, to neural activation and, potentially, cognition. The theory has generated both interest and scepticism, with some fundamental questions remaining. We review this intersection of quantum computing and quantum biology by outlining the similarities between these models of quantum computing and quantum cognition. We then address some of the open questions and the lessons that might be learned in each context. In doing so, we highlight a promising bidirectional exchange: not only might quantum computing offer tools for understanding quantum biology, but biological models may also inspire novel strategies for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work of Beverland et al. has shown that any exact Clifford+$T$ implementation of the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate must use at least $n$ $T$ gates. Here we show how to get away with exponentially fewer $T$ gates, at the cost of incurring a tiny $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error that can be neglected in most practical situations. More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be implemented to within error $\epsilon$ in the diamond distance by a randomly chosen Clifford+$T$ circuit with at most $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ $T$ gates. We also give a matching $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon))$ lower bound that establishes optimality, and we show that any purely unitary implementation achieving even constant error must use $\Omega(n)$ $T$ gates. We also extend our sampling technique to implement other Boolean functions. Finally, we describe upper and lower bounds on the $T$-count of Boolean functions in terms of non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity and its randomized analogue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient learning of quantum state properties is both a fundamental and practical problem in quantum information theory. Classical shadows have emerged as an efficient method for estimating properties of unknown quantum states, with rigorous statistical guarantees, by performing randomized measurement on a few number of copies. With the advent of photonic technologies, formulating efficient learning algorithms for such platforms comes out as a natural problem. Here, we introduce a classical shadow protocol for learning photonic quantum states via randomized passive linear optical transformations and photon-number measurement. We show that this scheme is efficient for a large class of observables of interest. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a twelve-mode photonic integrated quantum processing unit. Our protocol allows for scalable learning of a wide range of photonic state properties and paves the way to applying the already rich variety of applications of classical shadows to photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Kaniadakis entropy as a measure of quantum correlations through implicit bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</description>

      <title>Magic and communication complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost.
  Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ with any quantum advice state. If we allow mid-circuit measurements and adaptive circuits, we obtain an upper bound on the two-way communication complexity of $f$ in terms of the magic + measurement cost of the circuit for $f$. As an application, we obtain magic-count lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ for the $n$-qubit generalized Toffoli gate as well as the $n$-qubit quantum multiplexer.
  Our second result gives a general method to transform $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous quantum messages with shared entanglement) into $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols (simultaneous classical messages with shared entanglement) which incurs only a polynomial blowup in the communication and entanglement complexity, provided the referee's action in the $\mathsf{Q}\|^*$ protocol is implementable in constant $T$-depth. The resulting $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ protocols satisfy strong privacy constraints and are $\mathsf{PSM}^*$ protocols (private simultaneous message passing with shared entanglement), where the referee learns almost nothing about the inputs other than the function value. As an application, we demonstrate $n$-bit partial Boolean functions whose $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ complexity is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and whose $\mathsf{R}$ (interactive randomized) complexity is $n^{\Omega(1)}$, establishing the first exponential separations between $\mathsf{R}\|^*$ and $\mathsf{R}$ for Boolean functions.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Circuits with Ultraslow Dynamics to Classical Plaquette Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of hybrid quantum circuits involving unitary gates and projective measurements that display a measurement-induced phase transition. Remarkably, the volume-law phase featuring logarithmic entanglement growth for certain initial states. We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior, offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.</description>

      <title>When quantum resources backfire: Non-gaussianity and symplectic coherence in noisy bosonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</description>

      <title>On quantum to classical comparison for Davies generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting.
  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</description>

      <title>Transversal dimension jump for product qLDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce transversal dimension jump, a code-switching protocol for lifted product (LP) quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes across different chain-complex dimensions, enabling universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead. The construction leverages the product structure of LP codes to implement one-way transversal CNOTs between a 3D code and its 2D component codes, enabling teleportation-based switching. Combined with constant-depth CCZ gates in 3D LP codes and low-overhead transversal Clifford gates in 2D LP codes, this yields universal, high-rate quantum logical computation with high thresholds and low space-time costs. Beyond asymptotic schemes, we identify explicit 3D-2D LP code pairs supporting cup-product CCZ gates, including bivariate tricycle-bicycle families such as the $[[81,3,5]]$-$[[54,2,6]]$ pair, where the 3D tricycle codes admit depth-2 CCZ, weight-6 stabilizers, and pseudo-thresholds $\gtrsim 0.4\%$. As a byproduct, we show that the 3D codes enable highly efficient magic-state preparation: a single round of stabilizer measurements followed by depth-2 CCZ and postselection produces states with error $&lt;10^{-9}$ and success probability $\sim 35\%$. Our results establish a native integration of qLDPC codes with complementary transversal gates-covering nearly all practically relevant families known so far-and open a broad design space for scalable, low-overhead universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>End-to-end quantum algorithms for tensor problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end quantum algorithm for tensor problems, including tensor PCA and planted kXOR, that achieves potential superquadratic quantum speedups over classical methods. We build upon prior works by Hastings~(\textit{Quantum}, 2020) and Schmidhuber~\textit{et al.}~(\textit{Phys.~Rev.~X.}, 2025), we address key limitations by introducing a native qubit-based encoding for the Kikuchi method, enabling explicit quantum circuit constructions and non-asymptotic resource estimation. Our approach substantially reduces constant overheads through a novel guiding state preparation technique as well as circuit optimizations, reducing the threshold for a quantum advantage. We further extend the algorithmic framework to support recovery in sparse tensor PCA and tensor completion, and generalize detection to asymmetric tensors, demonstrating that the quantum advantage persists in these broader settings. Detailed resource estimates show that 900 logical qubits, $\sim 10^{15}$ gates and $\sim 10^{12}$ gate depth suffice for a problem that classically requires $\sim 10^{23}$ FLOPs. The gate count and depth for the same problem without the improvements presented in this paper would be at least $10^{19}$ and $10^{18}$ respectively. These advances position tensor problems as a candidate for quantum advantage whose resource requirements benefit significantly from algorithmic and compilation improvements; the magnitude of the improvements suggest that further enhancements are possible, which would make the algorithm viable for upcoming fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Universal initial state preparation for first quantized quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism, which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines; statistics-aware or faster quantum Schur transforms promise further reductions.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Quantum Algorithm for Topology Optimization in Structural Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a key methodology in engineering design for finding efficient and robust structures. Due to the enormous size of the design space, evaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work, we present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology optimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the design space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Replica Exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature. Our work provides a rigorous acceleration mechanism for quantum Gibbs preparation.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Unambiguous Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is the S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for code problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to analyze this approach has been lacking.
  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous measurements. Given a family of states $\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about $x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the Quantum Decoding Problem.</description>

      <title>Is it Gaussian? Testing bosonic quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory, characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amortization systems are used widely in economy to generate payment schedules to repaid an initial debt with its interest. We present a generalization of these amortization systems by introducing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics based on vector spaces. Operators are defined for debt, amortization, interest and periodic payment and their mean values are computed in different orthonormal basis. The vector space of the amortization system will have dimension M, where M is the loan maturity and the vectors will have a SO(M) symmetry, yielding the possibility of rotating the basis of the vector space while preserving the distance among vectors. The results obtained are useful to add degrees of freedom to the usual amortization systems without affecting the interest profits of the lender while also benefitting the borrower who is able to alter the payment schedules. Furthermore, using the tensor product of algebras, we introduce loans entanglement in which two borrowers can correlate the payment schedules without altering the total repaid.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator.
  We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</description>

      <title>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</description>

      <title>Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Fisher Information, Training and Bias in Fourier Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</description>

      <title>Noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</description>

      <title>Towards Nonperturbative Solution of Quantum Dynamics : A Hamiltonian Mean Field Approximation Scheme with Perturbation Theory for Arbitray Strength of Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) that can handle interactions of any strength in quantum theory. This approach starts with an input Hamiltonian that can be solved exactly. The interaction effects are then built into this Hamiltonian through nonlinear feedback enforced by self consistency conditions. While the method itself is nonperturbative it can be systematically improved using a new perturbation method called 'mean field perturbation theory' which does not involve power series expansion in any small parameter. We put this scheme to the test on one dimensional anharmonic interactions using the harmonic approximation. The results are consistently accurate across various cases including quartic, sextic, and octic anharmonic oscillators, as well as the quartic double well oscillator (QDWO) even when the coupling strength varies widely. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated when we swap the input Hamiltonian for that of an infinite square well and still achieve comparable accuracy. When applied to the {\lambda}{\phi}4 quantum field theory this approach aligns with the Gaussian effective potential method under the harmonic approximation. Beyond that it reveals the condensate structure of the effective vacuum and highlights the instability of the perturbative ground state. Notably, our ground-state energy results for the QDWO stand in stark contrast to those from standard perturbation theory where Borel summation fails regardless of coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</description>

Abstract: We improve the Solovay--Kitaev theorem and algorithm for a general finite, inverse-closed generating set acting on a qudit. Prior versions of the algorithm efficiently find a word of length $O(n^{3+\delta})$ to approximate an arbitrary target gate to $n$ bits of precision. Using two new ideas, each of which reduces the exponent separately, our new bound on the word length is $O(n^{1.44042\ldots+\delta})$. Our result holds more generally for any finite set that densely generates any connected, semisimple real Lie group, with an extra length term in the noncompact case to reach group elements far away from the identity.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Parameterized Quantum Circuits and the Barren Plateau Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the relationship between the Fourier coefficients and the barren plateau problem emerging in parameterized quantum circuits. In particular, the sum of squares of the Fourier coefficients is exponentially restricted concerning the qubits under the barren plateau condition. Throughout theory and numerical experiments, we introduce that this property leads to the vanishing of a probability and an expectation formed by parameterized quantum circuits. The traditional barren plateau problem requires the variance of gradient, whereas our idea does not explicitly need a statistic. Therefore, it is not required to specify the kind of initial probability distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the family of extended tilted-CHSH inequalities in the single-prover cryptographic compiled setting. In particular, we show that a quantum polynomial-time prover can violate these Bell inequalities by at most negligibly more than the violation achieved by two non-communicating quantum provers. To obtain this result, we extend a sum-of-squares technique to monomials with arbitrarily high degree in the Bob operators and degree at most one in the Alice operators. We also introduce a notion of partial self-testing for the compiled setting, which resembles a weaker form of self-testing in the bipartite setting. As opposed to certifying the full model, partial self-testing attempts to certify the reduced states and measurements on separate subsystems. In the compiled setting, this is akin to the states after the first round of interaction and measurements made on that state. Lastly, we show that the extended tilted-CHSH inequalities satisfy this notion of a compiled self-test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>

Abstract: Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</description>

Abstract: The fading memory property is a key requirement for reservoir computers -- a specific type of recurrent neural network with fixed internal weights. While mostly undesired in gate-based quantum computing, dissipation due to material imperfections or coupling to the environment acts as a natural mechanism intrinsically providing fading memory to reservoir computers based on dynamical open quantum systems. In this work, we unravel a connection between the physical metric of optical absorption and the performance of quantum reservoir computers in terms of their short-term memory capacity. We establish this link by considering a coherent input encoding in conjunction with tunable qubit decay, giving precise control over the fading memory in the quantum reservoir computer. Our analysis enables us to identify a sweet-spot regime for the dissipation strength at which memory performance is maximized.</description>

      <title>Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum solver for partial differential equations based on a flexible matrix product operator representation. Utilizing mid-circuit measurements and a state-dependent norm correction, this scheme overcomes the restriction of unitary operators. Hence, it allows for the direct implementation of a broad class of differential equations governing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated for linear and non-linear partial differential equations using the example of the linearized Euler equations with absorbing boundaries and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. For a turbulence data set, we demonstrate potential advantages of the quantum tensor scheme over its classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergodicity in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasiconserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing crossover to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the crossover.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Monitoring of Multimode Squeezing</title>

Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum technologies, enhancing metrological sensitivity, boosting communication security, and enabling parallel processing in computation. Its practical potential, however, remains constrained by the inherent single-mode operation of homodyne detection, necessitating post-processing for multimode characterization. Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by employing multimode optical parametric amplification (MOPA), enabling loss-tolerant direct detection of squeezing in each mode, which in turn permits mode sorting after amplification. As a result, we demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the real-time monitoring of multimode squeezing. With a spatial light modulator sorting the modes, we simultaneously measure squeezing in nine spatial modes co-propagating within one beam. Although mode sorting and filtering reduce the detection efficiency to less than $0.3\%$, we observe high-purity squeezing of up to $-7.9 \pm 0.6$ dB -- to the best of our knowledge, the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed light. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time, loss-tolerant characterization of continuous-variable entanglement and extend it to the detection of cluster states. Similar methods can be applied in the frequency domain, facilitating a crucial capability for scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Finite Size and Large Depth and Equivalence to Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing are two of the most popular quantum optimization heuristics. While QAOA is known to be able to approximate quantum annealing, the approximation requires QAOA angles to vanish with the problem size $n$, whereas optimized QAOA angles are observed to be size-independent for small $n$ and constant in the infinite-size limit. This fact led to a folklore belief that QAOA has a mechanism that is fundamentally different from quantum annealing. In this work, we provide evidence against this by analytically showing that QAOA energy approximates that of quantum annealing under two conditions, namely that angles vary smoothly from one layer to the next and that the sum is bounded by a constant. These conditions are known to hold for near-optimal QAOA angles empirically. Our proof relies on a series expansion of QAOA energy in sum of angles, which we show converges to quantum annealing limit as QAOA depth grows for constant sum of angles even if angles do not vanish with problem size $n$. A corollary of our results is a quadratic improvement for the bound on depth required to compile Trotterized quantum annealing of the SK model in the average case.</description>

      <title>From Quantum-Mechanical Acceleration Limits to Upper Bounds on Fluctuation Growth of Observables in Unitary Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Speed Limits (QSLs) are fundamentally linked to the tenets of quantum mechanics, particularly the energy-time uncertainty principle. Notably, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) bound and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound are prominent examples of QSLs. Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been proposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by arbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of change over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian operator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective Hilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass any observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This relationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any observable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like observable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of our inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables related to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a harmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</description>

      <title>Isoprobability Models of Qubit Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering, use pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as control tools. Often, these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile (albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner, we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit control. Selection of hardware-aware temporal pulse shapes has the potential to decrease gate duration, overcome platform constraints and increase robustness to noise. We demonstrate this approach with two classes of isoprobability models, which derive from the established Landau-Majorana-St\"uckelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe (AEH) classes. We experimentally validate the isoprobability equivalence on an IBM Quantum processor, quantifying agreement with numerical simulations via the mean squared error (MSE). Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby avoiding the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum operations, bringing us one step closer to scalable quantum control in various quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations; coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption, demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.</description>

Abstract: A quantum memory for light is expected to play a crucial role in quantum communication protocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems that interact with their environments at arbitrary coupling strengths and are subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained not only by entropy production but also by this asymmetry. For general observables, we further prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term that characterizes environmental changes. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental limits of precision in a broad class of open quantum systems, beyond the traditional Markovian setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of local reminiscence in the PXP model, a constrained spin system realized in Rydberg atom arrays. The spectrum of this model is characterized by a majority of eigenstates that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, alongside a set of nonthermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, that violate it. While generic initial states lead to thermalization consistent with eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, special configurations generate non-ergodic dynamics and preserve memory of the initial state. In this work, we explore local memory retention using local fidelity and the dynamics of local observables. We find that two specific states, $\theta$-symmetric and blockaded states, exhibit robust local reminiscence, with fidelities near unity and suppressed fluctuations as the system size increases. Our results show that non-ergodic regimes can sustain stable local memory while still allowing for complex global dynamics, providing new insights into quantum many-body scars and constrained dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limits based on Jensen-Shannon and Jeffreys divergences for general physical processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional quantum systems undergoing general physical processes. These QSLs were obtained using two families of entropic measures, namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which in turn defines a faithful distance of quantum states, and the square root of the quantum Jeffreys divergence. The results apply to both closed and open quantum systems, and are evaluated in terms of the Schatten speed of the evolved state, as well as cost functions that depend on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of both initial and instantaneous states of the quantum system. To illustrate our findings, we focus on the unitary and nonunitary dynamics of mixed single-qubit states. In the first case, we obtain speed limits $\textit{\`{a} la}$ Mandelstam-Tamm that are inversely proportional to the variance of the Hamiltonian driving the evolution. In the second case, we set the nonunitary dynamics to be described by the noisy operations: depolarizing channel, phase damping channel, and generalized amplitude damping channel. We provide analytical results for the two entropic measures, present numerical simulations to support our results on the speed limits, comment on the tightness of the bounds, and provide a comparison with previous QSLs. Our results may find applications in the study of quantum thermodynamics, entropic uncertainty relations, and also complexity of many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, and error mitigation methods to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</description>

      <title>SQuaD: Smart Quantum Detection for Photon Recognition and Dark Count Elimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>PhotonIDs: ML-Powered Photon Identification System for Dark Count Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The quantum smooth label cover problem is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. This contrasts with the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). Our result aligns with the RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen (ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is also RE-hard. This aligns with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, a central result in quantum information theory that characterizes the resources needed to simulate quantum channels when entanglement is freely available. We derive a universal additive upper bound on the smoothed max-information in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi mutual information. This bound yields tighter single-shot results, eliminates the need for the post-selection technique, and leads to a conceptually simpler proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. By consolidating and streamlining earlier approaches, our result provides a clearer and more direct understanding of the resource costs of simulating quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Embedding-Aware Noise Modeling of Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the continuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals, and high-harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Electrical readout of spins in the absence of spin blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</description>

Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Markov Gaps and Entanglement Wedge Multiway Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov gap, defined as the difference between reflected entropy and mutual information, serves as a diagnostic for quantum recoverability and multipartite entanglement. In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>A Calibration-Free Fixed Point of Curved Boolean Logic Matching the Fine-Structure Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) admits a calibration-free fixed point at which the per-face holonomy $\theta_0$ is the same across independent minimal faces (CHSH, KCBS, SAT_6). Equality is enforced by solving the two-component system $F(\delta, \gamma_4, \gamma_5, \gamma_6) = (\theta_0^{(4)} - \theta_0^{(5)}, \theta_0^{(5)} - \theta_0^{(6))} = 0$ with a Gauss-Newton method (no external scale). A finite-difference Jacobian is full rank at the solution, implying local uniqueness. Working at the coupling level $g = |\theta_0|/(2\pi n)$ removes hidden length factors; at the equality point our normalization audit shows $g = \alpha$ (Thomson limit) within numerical tolerance. The SU(1,1) corner words and overlap placements used to compute $\theta_0$ are specified exactly; we also report a variational minimax analysis on g and a pilot non-backtracking spectral density that coincides numerically with the per-edge coupling, suggesting a purely topological formulation. Scope: the match is to the low-energy (Thomson) limit; a full spectral equality on the contextual complex is left as a short conjecture. These results promote the CBL-$\alpha$ connection from a calibrated identification to a calibration-free derivation candidate.</description>
