      <title>Visualizing the Evolution of Twitter (X.com) Conversations: A Comprehensive Methodology Applied to AI Training Discussions on ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media platforms, especially X.com (formerly Twitter), there is a growing interest in understanding digital social networks and human digital interactions. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for extracting, processing, and visually analyzing data from X.com, using a combination of Python and R packages, enhanced by our publicly accessible, customizable code. Our approach compiles a dynamic dataset that captures various interactions: replies, retweets, and mentions. To explore deeper insights, the data is subjected to sentiment analysis and keyword coding, indicating shifts in discourse over time. Our method is structured in three primary phases. Initially, R is employed for pulling data and the formation of social network datasets. Following this, the combination of Python and R is utilized for sentiment analysis and keyword coding, aiming to uncover the underlying emotional shifts and language transitions within topics of discussion. The final phase employs R to visualize the dynamic shifts within these social networks. These visualization tools highlight changes in user interactions and patterns of influence. For a practical demonstration, we analyzed conversations on X.com regarding the controversial proposal to halt AI development, focusing specifically on discussions about ChatGPT. By using keyword searches, leading voices in the debate were identified. Our analysis of sentiment and keywords revealed patterns in emotions and language, while visual tools illustrated the development of network connections and their influence. This study emphasizes the vital role of visual tools in understanding online social dynamics in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Feelings about Bodies: Emotions on Diet and Fitness Forums Reveal Gendered Stereotypes and Body Image Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gendered expectations about ideal body types can lead to body image concerns, dissatisfaction, and in extreme cases, disordered eating and other psychopathologies across the gender spectrum. While research has focused on pro-anorexia online communities that glorify the 'thin ideal', less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ('bigorexia') present in online discussions. To address these gaps, we analyze 46 Reddit discussion forums related to diet, fitness, and associated mental health challenges. Using membership structure analysis and transformer-based language models, we project these communities along gender and body ideal axes, revealing complex interactions between gender, body ideals, and emotional expression. Our findings show that feminine-oriented communities generally express more negative emotions, particularly in thinness-promoting forums. Conversely, communities focused on the muscular ideal exhibit less negativity, regardless of gender orientation. We also uncover a gendered pattern in emotional indicators of mental health challenges, with communities discussing serious issues aligning more closely with thinness-oriented, predominantly feminine-leaning communities. By revealing the gendered emotional dynamics of online communities, our findings can inform the development of more effective content moderation approaches that facilitate supportive interactions, while minimizing exposure to potentially harmful content.</description>

      <title>When LLM Meets Hypergraph: A Sociological Analysis on Personality via Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual personalities significantly influence our perceptions, decisions, and social interactions, which is particularly crucial for gaining insights into human behavior patterns in online social network analysis. Many psychological studies have observed that personalities are strongly reflected in their social behaviors and social environments. In light of these problems, this paper proposes a sociological analysis framework for one's personality in an environment-based view instead of individual-level data mining. Specifically, to comprehensively understand an individual's behavior from low-quality records, we leverage the powerful associative ability of LLMs by designing an effective prompt. In this way, LLMs can integrate various scattered information with their external knowledge to generate higher-quality profiles, which can significantly improve the personality analysis performance. To explore the interactive mechanism behind the users and their online environments, we design an effective hypergraph neural network where the hypergraph nodes are users and the hyperedges in the hypergraph are social environments. We offer a useful dataset with user profile data, personality traits, and several detected environments from the real-world social platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network-based dataset containing both hypergraph structure and social information, which could push forward future research in this area further. By employing the framework on this dataset, we can effectively capture the nuances of individual personalities and their online behaviors, leading to a deeper understanding of human interactions in the digital world.</description>

      <title>Decoding Political Polarization in Social Media Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms significantly influence ideological divisions by enabling users to select information that aligns with their beliefs and avoid opposing viewpoints. Analyzing approximately 47 million Facebook posts, this study investigates the interactions of around 170 million users with news pages, revealing distinct patterns based on political orientations. While users generally prefer content that reflects their political biases, the extent of engagement varies even among individuals with similar ideological leanings. Specifically, political biases heavily influence commenting behaviors, particularly among users leaning towards the center-left and the right. Conversely, the 'likes' from center-left and centrist users are more indicative of their political affiliations. This research illuminates the complex relationship between social media behavior and political polarization, offering new insights into the manifestation of ideological divisions online.</description>

      <title>Academic Freedom and International Research Collaboration: A Longitudinal Analysis of Global Network Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of academic freedom has come to the fore as nations around the world experience a wave of democratic backsliding. Institutions of higher education are often targets of autocrats who seek to suppress intellectual sources of social and political resistance. At the same time, international collaboration in scientific research has reached an all-time high, and the network of global science grows larger and denser every year. This research analyzes the effects of academic freedom on international research collaboration (IRC) among a sample of 166 countries. Global international collaboration data are drawn from articles in Web of Science across a 33-year time frame (1993-2022) and used to construct three separate IRC networks in science and technology (S&amp;T), social sciences (SocSci), and arts and humanities (A&amp;H). The Academic Freedom Index, covering the same time frame, is drawn from the Varieties of Democracy Project. Stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) are used to analyze the networks, implemented using the R package RSiena. Since IRC networks are naturally weighted by frequency of international co-authorship instances for each year, the R package backbone is used to binarize and trim the ties. Numerous endogenous network control variables are included in the model, as are exogenous country level factors, including geographic distance, number of authors, and GDP. The results show positive significant estimates for direct effects, non-linear direct effects, and homophily effects of academic freedom on tie creation and maintenance over time. These estimates increase in strength moving from the S&amp;T network, to the SocSci network, and is strongest in the A\&amp;H network. This research provides support for the theory that academic research flourishes within environments of intellectual openness and freedom.</description>

      <title>Towards Asimov's Psychohistory: Harnessing Topological Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence and Social Media data to Forecast Societal Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of big data and advanced computational methods, the prediction of large-scale social behaviors, reminiscent of Isaac Asimov's fictional science of Psychohistory, is becoming increasingly feasible. This paper consists of a theoretical exploration of the integration of computational power and mathematical frameworks, particularly through Topological Data Analysis (TDA) (Carlsson, Vejdemo-Johansson, 2022) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to forecast societal trends through social media data analysis. By examining social media as a reflective surface of collective human behavior through the systematic behaviorist approach (Glenn, et al., 2016), I argue that these tools provide unprecedented clarity into the dynamics of large communities. This study dialogues with Asimov's work, drawing parallels between his visionary concepts and contemporary methodologies, illustrating how modern computational techniques can uncover patterns and predict shifts in social behavior, contributing to the emerging field of digital sociology -- or even, Psychohistory itself.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage their auxiliary information. The core idea of KG-enhanced recommenders is to incorporate rich semantic information for more accurate recommendations. However, two main challenges persist: i) Neglecting complex higher-order interactions in the KG-based user-item network, potentially leading to sub-optimal recommendations, and ii) Dealing with the heterogeneous modalities of input sources, such as user-item bipartite graphs and KGs, which may introduce noise and inaccuracies. To address these issues, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Heterogeneous Hypergraph Recommender System (KHGRec). KHGRec captures group-wise characteristics of both the interaction network and the KG, modeling complex connections in the KG. Using a collaborative knowledge heterogeneous hypergraph (CKHG), it employs two hypergraph encoders to model group-wise interdependencies and ensure explainability. Additionally, it fuses signals from the input graphs with cross-view self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our model's superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines, with an average 5.18\% relative improvement. Additional tests on noise resilience, missing data, and cold-start problems demonstrate the robustness of our KHGRec framework. Our model and evaluation datasets are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/viethungvu1998/KHGRec}.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Graph Transformers Across Diverse Graphs and Tasks via Pre-Training on Industrial-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Patterns from Biological Networks: A Compounded Burr Probability Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex biological networks, comprising metabolic reactions, gene interactions, and protein interactions, often exhibit scale-free characteristics with power-law degree distributions. However, empirical studies have revealed discrepancies between observed biological network data and ideal power-law fits, highlighting the need for improved modeling approaches. To address this challenge, we propose a novel family of distributions, building upon the baseline Burr distribution. Specifically, we introduce the compounded Burr (CBurr) distribution, derived from a continuous probability distribution family, enabling flexible and efficient modeling of node degree distributions in biological networks. This study comprehensively investigates the general properties of the CBurr distribution, focusing on parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood method. Subsequently, we apply the CBurr distribution model to large-scale biological network data, aiming to evaluate its efficacy in fitting the entire range of node degree distributions, surpassing conventional power-law distributions and other benchmarks. Through extensive data analysis and graphical illustrations, we demonstrate that the CBurr distribution exhibits superior modeling capabilities compared to traditional power-law distributions. This novel distribution model holds great promise for accurately capturing the complex nature of biological networks and advancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Elected Politicians and Their Constituents? Quantitative Evidence From Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How similar are politicians to those who vote for them? This is a critical question at the heart of democratic representation and particularly relevant at times when political dissatisfaction and populism are on the rise. To answer this question we compare the online discourse of elected politicians and their constituents. We collect a two and a half years (September 2020 - February 2023) constituency-level dataset for USA and UK that includes: (i) the Twitter timelines (5.6 Million tweets) of elected political representatives (595 UK Members of Parliament and 433 USA Representatives), (ii) the Nextdoor posts (21.8 Million posts) of the constituency (98.4% USA and 91.5% UK constituencies). We find that elected politicians tend to be equally similar to their constituents in terms of content and style regardless of whether a constituency elects a right or left-wing politician. The size of the electoral victory and the level of income of a constituency shows a nuanced picture. The narrower the electoral victory, the more similar the style and the more dissimilar the content is. The lower the income of a constituency, the more similar the content is. In terms of style, poorer constituencies tend to have a more similar sentiment and more dissimilar psychological text traits (i.e. measured with LIWC categories).</description>

      <title>Characteristics and prevalence of fake social media profiles with AI-generated faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have raised concerns about their potential to create convincing fake social media accounts, but empirical evidence is lacking. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of Twitter (X) accounts using human faces generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for their profile pictures. We present a dataset of 1,420 such accounts and show that they are used to spread scams, spam, and amplify coordinated messages, among other inauthentic activities. Leveraging a feature of GAN-generated faces -- consistent eye placement -- and supplementing it with human annotation, we devise an effective method for identifying GAN-generated profiles in the wild. Applying this method to a random sample of active Twitter users, we estimate a lower bound for the prevalence of profiles using GAN-generated faces between 0.021% and 0.044% -- around 10K daily active accounts. These findings underscore the emerging threats posed by multimodal generative AI. We release the source code of our detection method and the data we collect to facilitate further investigation. Additionally, we provide practical heuristics to assist social media users in recognizing such accounts.</description>

      <title>Edge Importance in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are made up of vertices and edges. The latter connect the vertices. There are several ways to measure the importance of the vertices, e.g., by counting the number of edges that start or end at each vertex, or by using the subgraph centrality of the vertices. It is more difficult to assess the importance of the edges. One approach is to consider the line graph associated with the given network and determine the importance of the vertices of the line graph, but this is fairly complicated except for small networks. This paper compares two approaches to estimate the importance of edges of medium-sized to large networks. One approach computes partial derivatives of the total communicability of the weights of the edges, where a partial derivative of large magnitude indicates that the corresponding edge may be important. Our second approach computes the Perron sensitivity of the edges. A high sensitivity signals that the edge may be important. The performance of these methods and some computational aspects are discussed. Applications of interest include to determine whether a network can be replaced by a network with fewer edges with about the same communicability.</description>
