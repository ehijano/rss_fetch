      <title>Different Inhomogeneous Evolutionary Histories for Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous evolution models for Uranus and Neptune, employing an interior composition of methane, ammonia, water, and rocks. Following formation trends of the gas giants, Uranus and Neptune formation models are applied, where both planets begin with layers stable to convection. Both planets are subject to convective mixing throughout their evolution. Uranus undergoes modest convective mixing, preserving much of its primordial internal heat. In contrast, Neptune's interior undergoes extensive mixing, homogenization, and adiabatic cooling of the outer 40\% of its envelope. The subsequent release of internal energy in Neptune, driven by the convective instability of its primordial outer compositional gradient, accounts for its higher luminosity relative to Uranus. Thus, the observed luminosity differences between Uranus and Neptune could be primarily dictated by the convective stability of their outer envelopes. The extensive convective mixing in Neptune leads to a higher metallicity in its outer region compared to Uranus, a feature seen in atmospheric measurements and shown in past interior models of Neptune. Due to Neptune's more pronounced cooling, our models predict favorable conditions for hydrogen-water immiscibility in its envelope.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Optical Characterization of Near-Earth Objects: Science Commissioning of the Recently Upgraded Mid-Infrared Camera MIRSI on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) have historically been a valuable tool for understanding their physical properties. However, the current state of mid-IR instruments on ground-based telescopes places several limitations on performing thermal characterization of NEOs. The complexity of maintaining these instruments in operational conditions on telescopes has led to their decommissioning. Here, we present the first science commissioning observations out to 12.5 microns from the upgraded Mid-Infrared Spectrograph and Imager (MIRSI) at the NASA-IRTF. We obtained 42 observations of 31 NEOs and derived their diameters and albedos. Since MIRSI allows simultaneous optical observations with its MIRSI Optical Camera (MOC), we were able to determine the absolute magnitude for most of the targets at the time of the thermal acquisition. We present ejecta characterization for the Didymos system from observations made 11 hours and 9 days after the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact. We present albedo and size measurements for (98943) Torifune 2001 CC21, the fly-by target of the Japanese Extended Hayabusa2 Mission. We also highlight several applications that the MIRSI system will provide for future airless body characterization, such as constraining thermal inertia from simultaneous optical and thermal lightcurves. This work also demonstrates the importance of having MIRSI as an available rapid-response instrument for planetary defense purposes.</description>

      <title>The Mineralogical Connection Between M- and K-type Asteroids as Indicated by Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetry has the capacity to provide a unique probe of the surface properties of asteroids. Trends in polarization behavior as a function of wavelength trace asteroid regolith mineral properties that are difficult to probe without measurements in situ or on returned samples. We present recent results from our ongoing survey of near-infrared polarimetric properties of asteroids. Our data reveal a mineralogical link between asteroids in the broader M- and K- spectral classes. In particular, M-type objects (16) Psyche, (55) Pandora, (135) Hertha, and (216) Kleopatra show the same polarimetric-phase behavior as K-type objects (89) Julia, (221) Eos, and (233) Asterope from visible through near-infrared light. The near-infrared behavior for these objects is distinct from other classes observed to date, and shows a good match to the polarimetric properties of M-type asteroid (21) Lutetia from the visible to the near-infrared. The best link for these objects from laboratory polarimetric phase curve measurements is to a troilite-rich fine-grained regolith. Our observations indicate that the M- and K-type spectral classes are most likely part of a continuum, with the observed spectral differences due to heterogeneity from partial differentiation, shock darkening of the surface material, or other later evolution of the original parent population. We also provide incidental J- and H-band polarimetric observations of other Main Belt asteroids obtained during our survey.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VII. SOPHIE discovery of BEBOP-3b, a circumbinary giant planet on an eccentric orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary systems orbiting close binaries are valuable testing grounds for planet formation and migration models. More detections with good mass measurements are needed. We present a new planet discovered during the BEBOP survey for circumbinary exoplanets using radial velocities. We use data taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, and perform a spectroscopic analysis to obtain high precision radial velocities. This planet is the first radial velocity detection of a previously unknown circumbinary system. The planet has a mass of $0.56$ $M_{Jup}$ and orbits its host binary in 550 days with an eccentricity of 0.25. Compared to most of the previously known circumbinary planets, BEBOP-3b has a long period (relative to the binary) and a high eccentricity. There also is a candidate outer planet with a $\sim1400$ day orbital period. We test the stability of potential further candidate signals inside the orbit of BEBOP-3b, and demonstrate that there are stable orbital solutions for planets near the instability region which is where the Kepler circumbinary planets are located. We also use our data to obtain independent dynamical masses for the two stellar components of the eclipsing binary using High Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS), and compare those results to a more traditional approach, finding them compatible with one another.</description>

      <title>Application of a modified commercial laser mass spectrometer as a science analog of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ESA/NASA Rosalind Franklin rover, planned for launch in 2028, will carry the first laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer (LDI-MS) to Mars as part of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument. MOMA will contribute to the astrobiology goals of the mission through the analysis of potential organic biosignatures. Due to the minimal availability of comparable equipment, laboratory analyses using similar techniques and instrumentation have been limited. In this study, we present a modified commercial benchtop LDI-MS designed to replicate MOMA functionality and to enable rapid testing of samples for MOMA validation experiments. We demonstrate that our instrument can detect organic standards in mineral matrices, with MS/MS enabling structural identification even in complex mixtures. Performance was additionally validated against an existing LDI-MS prototype through the comparison of spectra derived from natural samples from a Mars analog site in the Atacama Desert. Lastly, analysis of Mars analog synthetic mineral mixes highlights the capacity of the instrument to characterize both the mineralogical and organic signals in mission-relevant samples. This modified benchtop instrument will serve as a platform for collaborative research to prepare for MOMA operations, test LDI parameters, and generate pre-flight reference data in support of the mission science and astrobiology specific goals.</description>

      <title>On the Size of the Mission Suite Enabled by NASA's Deep Space Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is the primary means of commanding, tracking, and receiving data from all of NASA's deep space missions, as well as a number of deep space missions operated by other international space agencies. The current number of missions enabled by the DSN is approximately 40 missions, but there has been concern about the level of "over-subscription" of the DSN, namely that the number of missions currently using the DSN is larger than can be enabled reasonably. This manuscript assesses the maximum number of missions that could be enabled, based on recent performance and with the constraint that the total number of hours used per week does not exceed the available number of DSN antenna-hours. Three different models are considered, and the maximal number of missions that could be enabled ranges between approximately 40 missions and 70 missions, assuming that there continues to be approximately six Mars missions and that those Mars missions continue to make use of the DSN's multiple spacecraft per antenna (MSPA) capability. Crucially, the conclusion that an approximately 50% growth in the DSN mission suite rests on the assumption that the DSN antennas are "interchangeable," but they are not, with some spacecraft able to use only certain antennas. Efforts to make the DSN antennas more "interchangeable," primarily in their transmitter and receiver suites, would be an effective means of ensuring expanded capability. Additional findings from this work are that, while additional use of the MSPA capability might appear to be a promising means for increasing the mission suite, there appear to be no locations in the Solar System, other than Mars, for which it would be effective.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of young isolated planetary mass objects in Taurus and Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary mass objects-worlds that roam interstellar space untethered to a parent star-challenge conventional notions of planetary formation and migration, but also of star and brown dwarf formation. We focus on the multiplicity among free-floating planets. By virtue of their low binding energy (compared to other objects formed in these environments), these low-mass substellar binaries represent a most sensitive probe of the mechanisms at play during the star formation process. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and its Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope and its ERIS adaptive optics facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the Upper Scorpius and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 5-33 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4 mas, or $\sim$18 au assuming a distance of 160pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3-6 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and a secondary mass between 2.6-5.2 M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the assumed age. This corresponds to an overall binary fraction of 1.8$^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$% among free-floating planetary mass objects over the separation range $\ge$7 au. Despite the limitations of small-number statistics and variations in spatial resolution and sensitivity, our results, combined with previous high-spatial-resolution surveys, suggest a notable difference in the multiplicity properties of objects below $\sim$25 M$_{\rm Jup}$ between Upper Sco and Taurus. In Taurus, five companions were identified among 78 observed objects (4.9$^{+2.8}_{-2.0}$%), whereas none were found among 97 objects in Upper Sco ($\le$1.2%).}</description>

      <title>An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043. However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image pipeline for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract 1-year light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_{\rm E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>Multi-band, Multi-epoch Photometry of the Spot-crossing System TOI-3884: Refined System Geometry and Spot Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spot-crossing transits offer a unique opportunity to probe spot properties such as temperature, size, and surface distribution. TOI-3884 is a rare system in which spot-crossing features are persistently observed during every transit. This is due to its unusual configuration: a nearly poler orbit super-Neptune transits a pole-on mid-M dwarf, repeatedly crossing a polar spot. However, previous studies have reported discrepant values in key system parameters, such as stellar inclination and obliquity. To address this, we conducted multi-band, multi-epoch transit observations of TOI-3884b using the MuSCAT instrument series, along with photometric monitoring with the LCO 1m telescopes/Sinistro. We detected time-dependent variations in the spot-crossing signals, indicating that the spot is not exactly on the pole. From the monitoring data, we measured a stellar rotation period of $11.043~_{-0.053}^{+0.054}$ days with a modulation amplitude of $\sim$5% in the r-band, consistent with the time variability in the spot-crossing features. Our analysis reconciles previous discrepancies and improves the constraints on the parameters of the system geometry ($i_\star = 139.9~^{+1.2}_{-2.0}$ deg and $\lambda =41.0~^{+3.7}_{-9.0}$ deg) and those of the spot properties (spot radius of $0.425~_{-0.011}^{+0.018}~R_\star$ and spot-photosphere temperature difference of $200~_{-9}^{+11}$ K). These results provide a critical context for interpreting upcoming transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3884b, as well as yielding new insights into the magnetic activity and spin-orbit geometry of M dwarfs.</description>
