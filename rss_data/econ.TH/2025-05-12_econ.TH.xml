      <title>Utility Maximization Under Endogenous Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a general existence result for optimal decision-making when choices affect the probabilities of uncertain outcomes. We introduce a continuity condition - a version of upper semi-continuity for choice-dependent probability measures - which ensures upper semi-continuity of expected utility. Our topological proof does not require standard assumptions such as concavity of preferences or monotonicity of outcome distributions. Additionally, we identify sufficient conditions, including continuity of densities and stochastic dominance, which allow the main assumption to be verified in relevant economic contexts. These findings expand the applicability of expected utility theory in settings with endogenous uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Price Equilibria in a Spatial Competition with Captive Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores price competition with exogenous product differentiation in a spatial model similar to that of Nakagawa (2023). Nakagawa examines product differentiation within the framework of Varian (1980). Nakagawa integrates Varian's concept of uninformed consumers, who lack complete price information, into a spatial model based on Hotelling (1929). While Nakagawa placed informed consumers at the center of the Hotelling line and used quadratic transportation costs, our study employs a uniform distribution of informed consumers and linear transportation costs. This approach enables a more direct comparison with established spatial competition literature, particularly Osborne and Pitchik (1987). We classify equilibrium candidates and characterize the parameter regions corresponding to each equilibrium. There is no pure equilibrium in the region where we construct mixed strategy equilibria. Furthermore, we compare the expected profit in the equilibrium of our model with the findings of Osborne and Pitchik (1987). Finally, we discuss the impact of captive buyers on the nature of spatial competition.</description>

      <title>More Than Opinions: The Role of Values in Shaping Fairness and Status in the Ultimatum Game within Structured Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric evolutionary games, such as the Ultimatum Game, provide keys to understanding the emergence of fairness in social species. Building on this framework, we explore the evolution of social value systems and the operational role that social status plays in hierarchically organised societies. Within the asymmetric Ultimatum Game paradigm, where "proposers" suggest terms for resource distribution, and "responders" accept or reject these terms, we examine the assignment of roles between players under a subjective social order. This order is grounded in an emergent status hierarchy based on observable player attributes (such as age and wealth). The underlying rules for constructing such a hierarchy stabilise over time by inheritance and family ties. Despite their subjective nature these (often sub-conscious) value systems have operative meaning in controlling access of individuals to resources and decision making. We demonstrate these effects using a simple but sufficiently complex model with dynamical population size and network structure, where division of resources (prey) is carried out according to the principles of the Ultimatum Game. We focus on the emerging proposer and responder thresholds under distinct social hierarchies and interaction networks and discuss them in relation to the extensive body of Ultimatum Game experiments conducted across a wide range of cultural contexts. We observe the emergence of diverse sharing norms, ranging from unfair to highly generous, alongside the development of various social norms.</description>

      <title>Group knowledge and individual introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributed knowledge, which is what privately informed agents come to know by communicating freely with one another and sharing everything they know. Knowledge is not necessarily partitional: agents may be boundedly rational and differ in the ability to form higher-order knowledge. We model the inference making process that leads to distributed knowledge, and we do that by introducing revision operators and revision types. Due to the heterogeneity of reasoning abilities, inference making turns out to be order dependent. We show that there are two qualitatively different cases of how distributed knowledge is attained. In the first, distributed knowledge is determined by any group member who can replicate all the inferences that anyone else in the group makes. This finding is in line with the extant literature. In the second case, no member can replicate all the inferences made within the group. As a result, distributed knowledge is determined by any two group members who can jointly replicate what anyone else infers. This case can be interpreted as a form of wisdom of crowd effect and shows that, contrary to what is generally believed, distributed knowledge cannot always be reduced to the reasoning abilities of a single group member.</description>

      <title>Undominated monopoly regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study undominated mechanisms with transfers for regulating a monopolist who privately observes the marginal cost of production. We show that in any undominated mechanism, there is a quantity floor, which depends only on the primitives, and the regulator's operation decision is stochastic only if the monopolist produces at the quantity floor. We provide a near-complete characterization of the set of undominated mechanisms and use it to (a) provide a foundation for deterministic mechanisms, (b) show that the efficient mechanism is dominated, and (c) derive a max-min optimal regulatory mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the existence of pure epsilon-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as the number of agents gets large, the share of games that admit a pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium converges to 1. Our result holds even for pure $\epsilon$-equilibria in which all agents, except for at most one, play a best response. In contrast, it is known that the share of games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, that is for $\epsilon=0$, is asymptotically $1-1/e\approx 0.63$. This suggests that very small deviations from perfect rationality, captured by positive values of $\epsilon$, suffice to ensure the general existence of stable outcomes. We also study the existence of pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium when the number of actions gets large. Our proofs rely on the probabilistic method and the Chen-Stein method.</description>
