      <title>Precise Mass, Orbital motion and Stellar properties of the M-dwarf binary LP 349-25AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LP~349$-$25 is a well studied close stellar binary system comprised of two late M dwarf stars, both stars close to the limit between star and brown dwarf. This system was previously identified as a source of GHz radio emission. We observed LP~349$-$25AB in 11 epochs in 2020$-$2022, detecting both components in this nearby binary system using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We fit simultaneously the VLBA absolute astrometric positions together with existing relative astrometric observations derived from optical/infrared observations with a set of algorithms that use non-linear least-square, Genetic Algorithm and Markov Chain Montecarlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We find the masses of the primary and secondary components to be 0.08188 $\pm$ 0.00061 $M\odot$, and 0.06411 $\pm$ 0.00049 $M_\odot$, respectively, representing one of the most precise mass estimates of any UCDs to date. The primary is an UCD of 85.71$\pm$0.64 M$_{Jup}$, while the secondary has a mass consistent with being a Brown Dwarf of 67.11 $\pm$ 0.51 $M_{Jup}$. This is one of the very few direct detections of a Brown Dwarf with VLBA observations. We also find a distance to the binary system of 14.122 $\pm$ 0.057 pc. Using Stellar Evolutionary Models, we find the model-derived stellar parameters of both stars. In particular, we obtain a model-derived age of 262 Myr for the system, which indicates that LP~349$-$25AB is composed of two pre-main-sequence stars. In addition, we find that the secondary star is significantly less evolved that the primary star.</description>

      <title>Chandra HETG X-ray Spectra and Variability of $\pi$ Aqr, a $\gamma$ Cas-type Be star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectra of $\pi\,$Aqr, a $\gamma\,$Cas-type star, obtained with the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer, revealed emission lines of H-like ions of Mg, Si, S, and Fe, a strong, hard continuum, and a lack of He-like ions, indicating the presence of very hot thermal plasma. The X-ray light curve showed significant fluctuations, with coherent variability at period of about 3400 seconds in one observation. The hardness ratio was relatively constant except for one observation in which the spectrum was much harder and more absorbed. We interpret the X-ray emission as arising from accretion onto the secondary, which is likely a magnetic white dwarf, an intermediate polar system.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of "Maia variables"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are different classes of pulsating stars in the H-R diagram. While many of those classes are undisputed, some remain a mystery such as the objects historically called "Maia variables." Whereas the presence of such a class was suggested seven decades ago, no pulsational driving mechanism is known that could excite short-period oscillations in these late B to early A-type stars. Alternative hypotheses that would render the reports of variability of those stars erroneous have been proposed, such as incorrect effective temperatures, binarity or rapid rotation, but no certain conclusions have been reached yet. Therefore, the existence of these variables as a homogeneous class of pulsating star is still under discussion. Meanwhile, many new candidates of these variables have been claimed especially by using photometric observations from space telescopes. In this study, we examined 31 objects that are alleged members of this hypothetical group and carried out detailed spectroscopic and photometric analyses to test the proposed hypotheses for their cause of variability. The $T_{eff}$, log$(g)$, $v$ sin $i$, and chemical abundances of the targets were determined and the $TESS$ photometric data were examined. As a result, we found that most of these targets are located inside the $\delta$ Scuti, $\beta$ Cephei, or SPB star instability strips, a few show evidence for binarity, and others exhibit rapid rotation. We give arguments that none of the apparently rapid pulsations in our targets is caused by a star outside any known instability strip. By extrapolation, we argue that most stars proposed as pulsators outside well-established instability domains are misclassified. Hence there is no sufficient evidence justifying the existence of a class of pulsating stars formerly known as the "Maia variables."</description>

      <title>Observations of Non-thermal Velocity and Comparison with Alfv\'en Wave Turbulence Model in Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of spectral line width measurements from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on {\it Hinode}. We used spectral line profiles of Fe {\sc xvi} 262.984 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 264.787 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 270.519 {\AA}, Fe {\sc xiv} 274.203 {\AA}, and Fe {\sc xv} 284.160 {\AA}, and studied 11 active regions. Previous studies of spectral line widths have shown that in hot loops in the cores of active regions, the observed non-thermal velocities are smaller than predicted from models of reconnection jets in the corona or shock heating associated with Alfv\'{e}n waves. The observed line widths are also inconsistent with models of chromospheric evaporation due to coronal nanoflares. We show that recent advances in higher resolution Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence modeling enables us to obtain non-thermal velocities similar to those measured in
  active regions. The observed non-thermal velocities for the 11 active regions in our study are in the range of 17$-$30 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$, consistent with the spectral line non-thermal widths predicted from our model of 16 interacting flux tubes, which are in the range of ~15$-$37 $\rm km ~ s^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A JWST Medium Resolution MIRI Spectrum and Models of the Type Ia supernova 2021aefx at +415 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum (5-27 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021aefx at $+415$ days past $B$-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx, to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find the temporal evolution of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mathrm{\mu}$m feature directly traces the decay of $^{56}$Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with White Dwarf (WD) central densities of $\rho_c=0.9-1.1\times 10^9$g cm$^{-3}$, a WD mass of M$_{\mathrm{WD}}$=1.33-1.35M$_\odot$, a WD magnetic field of $\approx10^6$G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at $\approx$ 0.5 $M_\odot$ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer. The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from $\gamma$-rays whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 d in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly `flat-tilted' profile at 9 $\mathrm{\mu}$m now has significant contribution from [Ni IV], [Fe II], and [Fe III] and less from [Ar III], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons excite mostly the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multi-dimensional models, our analysis strongly supports a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication for a pre-existing turbulent velocity field, and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.</description>

      <title>Frozen-field Modeling of Coronal Condensations with MPI-AMRVAC I: Demonstration in two-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale coronal plasma evolutions can be adequately described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. However, full multi-dimensional MHD simulations require substantial computational resources. Given the low plasma $\beta$ in the solar corona, in many coronal studies, it suffices to approximate the magnetic field to remain topologically fixed and effectively conduct one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic (HD) simulations instead. This approach is often employed in studies of coronal loops and their liability to form condensations related to thermal instability. While 1D HD simulations along given and fixed field line shapes are convenient and fast, they are difficult to directly compare with multi-dimensional phenomena. Therefore, it is more convenient to solve volume-filling, multi-dimensional versions of the MHD equations where we freeze the magnetic field, transforming it into frozen-field HD (ffHD) equations for simulation. We have incorporated this ffHD module into our open-source MPI-AMRVAC code and tested it using a two-dimensional (2D) evaporation--condensation model to study prominence formation due to radiative losses. The 2D ffHD results are compared with those from actual 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD simulations, analyzing the differences and their causes. Pseudo-2D studies account for the known {flux tube} expansion effects. Overall, the performance of 2D ffHD is close to that of 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD. The 2D tests conducted in this paper will be extended in follow-up studies to 3D simulations based on analytical or observational approaches.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Bridging theory and observations in stellar pulsations: The impact of convection and metallicity on the instability strips of Classical and Type-II Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of metallicity on the theoretical and empirical period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheid variables is not well understood and remains a highly debated issue. Here, we examine empirical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Classical and Type-II Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and compare those with the theoretically predicted instability strip (IS) edges. We explore the effects of incorporating turbulent flux, turbulent pressure, and radiative cooling into the convection theory on the predicted IS at various metallicities using MESA-RSP. We find that the edges become redder with the increasing complexity of convection physics incorporated in the fiducial convection sets, and are similarly shifted to the red with increasing metallicity. The inclusion of turbulent flux and pressure improves the agreement of the red edge of the IS, while their exclusion leads to better agreement with observations of the blue edge. About 90% of observed stars are found to fall within the predicted bluest and reddest edges across the considered variations of turbulent convection parameters. Furthermore, we identify and discuss discrepancies between theoretical and observed CMDs in the low effective temperature and high luminosity regions for stars with periods greater than ~ 20 days. These findings highlight the potential for calibrating the turbulent convection parameters in stellar pulsation models or the prediction of a new class of rare, long-period, 'red Cepheids', thereby improving our understanding of Cepheids and their role in cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Detectability of axisymmetric magnetic fields from the core to the surface of oscillating post-main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in the stellar interiors are key candidates to explain observed core rotation rates inside solar-like stars along their evolution. Recently, asteroseismic estimates of radial magnetic field amplitudes near the hydrogen-burning shell (H-shell) inside about 24 red-giants (RGs) have been obtained by measuring frequency splittings from their power spectra. Using general Lorentz-stress (magnetic) kernels, we investigated the potential for detectability of near-surface magnetism in a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ star of super-solar metallicity as it evolves from a mid sub-giant to a late sub-giant into an RG. Based on these sensitivity kernels, we decompose an RG into three zones - deep core, H-shell, and near-surface. The sub-giants instead required decomposition into an inner core, an outer core, and a near-surface layer. Additionally, we find that for a low-frequency g-dominated dipolar mode in the presence of a typical stable magnetic field, ~25% of the frequency shift comes from the H-shell and the remaining from deeper layers. The ratio of the subsurface tangential field to the radial field in H-burning shell decides if subsurface fields may be potentially detectable. For p-dominated dipole modes close to $\nu_\rm{max}$, this ratio is around two orders of magnitude smaller in subgiant phases than the corresponding RG. Further, with the availability of magnetic kernels, we propose lower limits of field strengths in crucial layers in our stellar model during its evolutionary phases. The theoretical prescription outlined here provides the first formal way to devise inverse problems for stellar magnetism and can be seamlessly employed for slow rotators.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Fully-formed Forward--Reverse Shock Pair Due to the Interaction Between Two Coronal Mass Ejections at 0.5 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report direct observations of a fast magnetosonic forward--reverse shock pair observed by Solar Orbiter on March 8, 2022 at the short heliocentric distance of 0.5 au. The structure, sharing some features with fully-formed stream interaction regions (SIRs), is due to the interaction between two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), never previously observed to give rise to a forward--reverse shock pair. The scenario is supported by remote observations from the STEREO-A coronographs, where two candidate eruptions compatible with the in-situ signatures have been found. In the interaction region, we find enhanced energetic particle activity, strong non-radial flow deflections and evidence of magnetic reconnection. At 1~au, well radially-aligned \textit{Wind} observations reveal a complex event, with characteristic observational signatures of both SIR and CME--CME interaction, thus demonstrating the importance of investigating the complex dynamics governing solar eruptive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Kinetics Reduction for Astrophysical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology is developed to extract accurate skeletal reaction models for nuclear combustion. Local sensitivities of isotope mass fractions with respect to reaction rates are modeled based on the forced optimally time-dependent (f-OTD) scheme. These sensitivities are then analyzed temporally to generate skeletal models. The methodology is demonstrated by conducting skeletal reduction of constant density and temperature burning of carbon and oxygen relevant to SNe Ia. The 495-isotopes Torch model is chosen as the detailed reaction network. A map of maximum production of $^{56}\text{Ni}$ in SNe Ia is produced for different temperatures, densities, and proton to neutron ratios. The f-OTD simulations and the sensitivity analyses are then performed with initial conditions from this map. A series of skeletal models are derived and their performances are assessed by comparison against currently existing skeletal models. Previous models have been constructed intuitively by assuming the dominance of $\alpha$-chain reactions. The comparison of the newly generated skeletal models against previous models is based on the predicted energy release and $^{44}\text{Ti}$ and $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundances by each model. The consequences of $\mathtt{y}_e \neq 0.5$ in the initial composition are also explored where $\mathtt{y}_e$ is the electron fraction. The simulated results show that $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production decreases by decreasing $\mathtt{y}_e$ as expected, and that the $^{43}\text{Sc}$ is a key isotope in proton and neutron channels toward $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production. It is shown that an f-OTD skeletal model with 150 isotopes can accurately predict the $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundance in SNe Ia for $\mathtt{y}_e \lesssim 0.5$ initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Statistical relations between spectropolarimetric observables and the polar strength of the stellar dipolar magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global magnetic fields of early-type stars are commonly characterised by the mean longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_{\rm z} \rangle$ and the mean field modulus $\langle B \rangle$, derived from the circular polarisation and intensity spectra, respectively. Observational studies often report a root mean square (rms) of $\langle B_{\rm z} \rangle$ and an average value of $\langle B \rangle$. In this work, I used numerical simulations to establish statistical relationships between these cumulative magnetic observables and the polar strength, $B_{\rm d}$, of a dipolar magnetic field. I show that in the limit of many measurements randomly distributed in rotational phase, $\langle B_{\rm z} \rangle_{\rm rms}$=$0.179^{+0.031}_{-0.043}$$B_{\rm d}$ and $\langle B \rangle_{\rm avg}$=$0.691^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$$B_{\rm d}$. The same values can be recovered with only three measurements, provided that the observations are distributed uniformly in the rotational phase. These conversion factors are suitable for ensemble analyses of large stellar samples, where each target is covered by a small number of magnetic measurements.</description>

Abstract: We present in this paper a compilation of solar atlases from $\lambda$ 3000 {\AA} to $\lambda$ 8800 {\AA} with spectral lines identified by the Moore table and with the corresponding equivalent Lande factors g*. We used two spectra at disk centre ($\mu$ = 1.0), from Delbouille and Kurucz, and two spectra at the limb from Stenflo and Gandorfer, respectively at $\mu$ = 0.145 and $\mu$ = 0.10.</description>

      <title>Fine structure in the Sigma Orionis cluster revealed by Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sigma Orionis is an open cluster in the nearest giant star formation site - Orion. Its youth (3-5 Myr), low reddening, and relative vicinity make it an important benchmark cluster to study stellar and substellar formation and evolution. Young star-forming sites are complex and hierarchical. Precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 enables the exploration of their fine structure. We used the modified convergent point technique to kinematically re-evaluate the members in the Sigma Orionis cluster and its vicinity. We present clear evidence for three kinematically distinct groups in the Sigma Orionis region. The second group, the RV Orionis association, is adjacent to the Sigma Orionis cluster and is composed only of low-mass stars. The third group, the Flame association, whose age is comparable to that of Sigma Orionis, overlaps with the younger NGC 2024 in the Flame Nebula. In total, we have discovered 105 members of this complex not previously found in the literature (82 in Sigma Orionis, 19 in the Flame association, and 4 in the RV Orionis association).</description>

      <title>A Volume-Limited Radio Search for Magnetic Activity in 140 Exoplanets with the Very Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a search for radio emission in 77 stellar systems hosting 140 exoplanets, predominantly within 17.5 pc using the Very Large Array (VLA) at $4-8$ GHz. This is the largest and most sensitive search to date for radio emission in exoplanetary systems in the GHz frequency range. We obtained new observations of 58 systems, and analyzed archival observations of an additional 19 systems. Our choice of frequency and volume limit are motivated by radio detections of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), including T dwarfs with masses at the exoplanet threshold of $\sim\!13\,M_J$. Our surveyed exoplanets span a mass range of $\approx\,10^{-3}-10\,M_J$ and semi-major axes of $\approx\,10^{-2}-10\,$AU. We detect a single target - GJ 3323 (M4) hosting two exoplanets with minimum masses of 2 and 2.3$\,M_\oplus$ - with a circular polarization fraction of $\approx\,40\%$; the radio luminosity agrees with its known X-ray luminosity and the G\"udel-Benz relation for stellar activity suggesting a likely stellar origin, but the high circular polarization fraction may also be indicative of star-planet interaction. For the remaining sources our $3\sigma$ upper limits are generally $L_\nu\lesssim\,10^{12.5}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$, comparable to the lowest radio luminosities in UCDs. Our results are consistent with previous targeted searches of individual systems at GHz frequencies while greatly expanding the sample size. Our sensitivity is comparable to predicted fluxes for some systems considered candidates for detectable star-planet interaction. Observations with future instruments such as the Square Kilometer Array and Next Generation Very Large Array will be necessary to further constrain emission mechanisms from exoplanet systems at GHz frequencies.</description>

Abstract: A Bayesian method is used in this extensive work to generate a large set of minimally constrained equations of state (EOSs) for matters in neutron stars (NS). These EOSs are analyzed for their correlations with key NS properties, such as the tidal deformability, radius, and maximum mass, within the mass range of $1.2-2M_\odot$. The observed connections between the pressure of $\beta$-equilibrated matter and the properties of neutron stars at different densities offer significant insights into the behavior of NS matter in a nearly model-independent manner. The study also examines the influence of various factors on the correlation of symmetry energy parameters, such as slope and curvature parameters at saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 ~\text{fm}^{-3}$) with the tidal deformability and radius of neutron stars. This study investigates the robustness of the observed correlations by considering the distributions and interdependence of symmetry energy parameters. Furthermore, the utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to unveil the complicated relationship between various nuclear matter parameters and properties of neutron stars. This analysis highlights the importance of employing multivariate analysis techniques in order to comprehend the variety in tidal deformability and radius observed across distinct masses of NS. This comprehensive study aims to establish a connection between the parameters of nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars, providing significant insights into the behavior of NS matter across different circumstances.</description>

      <title>An improved correction of radial-velocity systematic for the SOPHIE spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision spectrographs might exhibit temporal variations of their reference velocity or nightly zero point (NZP). One way to monitor the NZP is to measure bright stars, which are assumed to have an intrinsic radial velocity variation much smaller than the instrument's precision. While this method is effective in most cases, it does not fully propagate the uncertainty arising from NZP variations. We present a new method to correct for NZP variations in radial-velocity time series. This method uses Gaussian Processes based on ancillary information to model these systematic effects. It enables us to propagate the uncertainties of this correction into the overall error budget. Another advantage of this approach is that it relies on ancillary data collected simultaneously with the spectra rather than solely on dedicated observations of constant stars. We applied this method to the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory using a few instrument's housekeeping data, such as the internal pressure and temperature variations. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively models the red noise of constant stars, even with a limited amount of housekeeping data, while preserving the signals of exoplanets. Using both simulations with mock planets and real data, we found that this method improves the false-alarm probability of detections by several orders of magnitude. By simulating numerous planetary signals, we were able to detect up to 10 percent more planets with small amplitude radial velocity signals. We used this new correction to reanalysed the planetary system around HD158259 and improved the detection of the outermost planets. We also suggest decreasing the observing cadence of the constant stars to optimise telescope time for scientific targets.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

      <title>Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE) Digitisation of astronomical plates and their integration into the International Virtual Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE) project is aimed at digitising astronomical photographic plates from three major German plate collections, making them accessible through integration into the International Virtual Observatory (IVO). Photographic plates and related materials (logbooks, envelopes, etc.) were scanned with commercial flatbed scanners. Astrometric and photometric calibrations were carried out with the developed PyPlate software, using Gaia EDR3 data as a reference. The APPLAUSE data publication complies with IVO standards. The latest data release contains images and metadata from 27 plate collections from the partner institutes in Hamburg, Bamberg, and Potsdam, along with digitised archives provided by Tautenburg, Tartu, and Vatican observatories. Altogether, over two billion calibrated measurements extracted from about 70,000 direct photographic plates can readily be used to create long-term light curves. For instance, we constructed the historic light curve of the enigmatic dipping star KIC 8462852. We found no evidence of previously assumed variations on timescales of decades in our light curve. Potential uses of APPLAUSE images for transient sources can be appreciated by following the development of the nova shell of GK Per (1901) over time and the change in brightness of two extragalactic supernovae. The database holds about 10,000 spectral plates. We made use of objective prism plates to follow the temporal changes of Nova DN Gem through 1912 and 1913, highlighting an outburst in early 1913.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments I. The turbulent support analytical model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR), the number of stars formed per unit of time, is a fundamental quantity in the evolution of the Universe. While turbulence is believed to play a crucial role in setting the SFR, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Turbulence promotes star formation by compressing the gas, but also slows it down by stabilizing the gas against gravity. Most widely-used analytical models rely on questionable assumptions, including: $i)$ integrating over the density PDF, a one-point statistical description that ignores spatial correlation, $ii)$ selecting self-gravitating gas based on a density threshold that often ignores turbulent dispersion, $iii)$ assuming the freefall time as the timescale for estimating SFR without considering the need to rejuvenate the density PDF, $iv)$ assuming the density PDF to be lognormal. Improving upon the only existing model that incorporates the spatial correlation of the density field, we present a new analytical model. We calculate the time needed to rejuvenate density fluctuations of a given density and spatial scale, revealing that it is generally much longer than the freefall time, rendering the latter inappropriate for use. We make specific predictions regarding the role of the Mach number, $ M $, and the driving scale of turbulence divided by the mean Jeans length. At low to moderate Mach numbers, turbulence does not reduce and may even slightly promote star formation by broadening the PDF. However, at higher Mach numbers, most density fluctuations are stabilized by turbulent dispersion, leading to a steep drop in the SFR as the Mach number increases.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments. II. Numerical simulations and comparison with analytical models</title>

Abstract: Predicting the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies is crucial to understand their evolution and morphology. To do so requires a fine understanding of how dense structures of gas are created and collapse. In that, turbulence and gravity play a major role. Within the gravo-turbulent framework, we assume that turbulence shapes the ISM, creating density fluctuations that, if gravitationally unstable, will collapse and form stars. The goal of this work is to quantify how different regimes of turbulence, characterized by the strength and compressibility of the driving, shape the density field. We are interested in the outcome in terms of SFR and how it compares with existing analytical models for the SFR. We run a series of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent gas. The simulations are first conducted without gravity, so that the density and velocity are shaped by the turbulence driving. Gravity is then switched on, and the SFR is measured and compared with analytical models. The physics included in these simulations is very close to the one assumed in the classical gravo-turbulent SFR analytical models, which makes the comparison straightforward. We found that the existing analytical models convincingly agree with simulations at low Mach number, but we measure a much lower SFR in the simulation with a high Mach number. We develop, in a companion paper, an updated physically-motivated SFR model that reproduces well the inefficient high Mach regime of the simulations. Our work demonstrates that accurate estimations of the turbulent-driven replenishment time of dense structures and the dense gas spatial distribution are necessary to correctly predict the SFR in the high Mach regime. The inefficient high-Mach regime is a possible explanation for the low SFR found in dense and turbulent environments such as the centers of our Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Most Common Habitable Planets III -- Modeling Temperature Forcing and Surface Conditions on Rocky Exoplanets and Exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small rocky planets, as well as larger planets that suffered extensive volatile loss, tend to be drier and have thinner atmospheres as compared to Earth. Such planets probably outnumber worlds better endowed with volatiles, being the most common habitable planets. For the subgroup of fast rotators following eccentric orbits, atmospheres suffer radiative forcing and their heat capacity provides a method for gauging atmospheric thickness and surface conditions. We further explore the model presented in a previous paper and apply it to real and hypothetical exoplanets in the habitable zone of various classes of stars, simulating atmospheric and orbital characteristics. For planetary eccentricities e ~0.3, the forcing-induced hypothetical temperature variation would reach ~80 K for airless planets and ~10 K for planets with substantial atmospheres. For Kepler-186 f and Kepler-442 b, assuming e ~0.1, temperature variations can reach ~24 K. We also consider habitable exomoons in circular orbits around gas giants within the habitable zone, which suffer radiative forcing due to their epicyclic motion. We study several combinations of parameters for the characterization of planets (mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis) and exomoons (mass, orbital radius, albedo and atmospheric characteristics) for different stellar types. For e ~0.3, exomoon temperature varies up to ~90 K, while for ~0.6 variations can reach ~200 K. Such exomoons may plausibly retain their volatiles by continued volcanic activity fueled by tidal dissipation. Although currently undetectable, such effects might be within reach of future ELT-class telescopes and space missions with mid-infrared and coronagraphic capabilities.</description>

      <title>The death of Vulcan: NEID reveals the planet candidate orbiting HD 26965 is stellar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the long-studied radial velocity (RV) target HD26965 using recent observations from the NASA-NSF 'NEID' precision Doppler facility. Leveraging a suite of classical activity indicators, combined with line-by-line RV analyses, we demonstrate that the claimed 45-day signal previously identified as a planet candidate is most likely an activity-induced signal. Correlating the bulk (spectrally-averaged) RV with canonical line activity indicators confirms a multi-day 'lag' between the observed activity indicator time series and the measured RV. When accounting for this lag, we show that much of the observed RV signal can be removed by a linear detrending of the data. Investigating activity at the line-by-line level, we find a depth-dependent correlation between individual line RVs and the bulk RVs, further indicative of periodic suppression of convective blueshift causing the observed RV variability, rather than an orbiting planet. We conclude that the combined evidence of the activity correlations and depth dependence is consistent with a radial velocity signature dominated by a rotationally-modulated activity signal at a period of $\sim$42 days. We hypothesize that this activity signature is due to a combination of spots and convective blueshift suppression. The tools applied in our analysis are broadly applicable to other stars, and could help paint a more comprehensive picture of the manifestations of stellar activity in future Doppler RV surveys.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $3.2 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 16 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitors do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are essentially determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\approx$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, representing $\approx 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\sim 3000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\sim 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3 alike. Gaia BH3-like systems represent a common product of isolated binary evolution at low metallicity ($Z&lt;0.01$), but given the steep density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one in the halo at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Considering the estimated formation efficiency for both the isolated and dynamical formation channel, we conclude that they are almost equally likely to explain the origin of Gaia BH3.</description>

Abstract: We present the analysis of archival Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE and multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band observations of the remnant associated with the ejecta of the mid-nineteenth century outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyx. These data sets are used to investigate its true 3D physical structure and the nebular expansion patterns along the line of sight and on the plane of the sky. The VLT MUSE emission line maps and 3D visualisations based on position-position-velocity diagrams reveal T Pyx as a bipolar nebula, with a knotty toroidal structure at its waist best seen in H$\beta$ and two open bowl-shaped bipolar lobes (a diabolo) best revealed by the [OIII] emission lines. The comparison of multi-epoch HST WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band images and VLT MUSE emission line maps of T Pyx reveals the angular expansion of the remnant through the proper motion of individual knots and nebular features. The angular expansion is confirmed to be homologous in the period from 1994.2 to 2007.4 before the recent 2011 outburst, but there is suggestive evidence that the inner knots have experienced a higher expansion rate since then.</description>

Abstract: The high-energy environment of the host stars could be deleterious for their planets. It is crucial to ascertain this contextual information to fully characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. We aim to fully characterize a unique triple system, LTT1445, with three known rocky exoplanets around LTT 1445A. The X-ray irradiation and flaring of this system are studied through a new 50 ks Chandra observation, which is divided into 10 ks, 10 ks, and 30 ks segments conducted two days apart, and two months apart, respectively. This is complemented by an archival Chandra observation approximately one year earlier and repeated observations with eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, enabling the investigation of X-ray flux behavior across multiple time scales. With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star A, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of each exoplanet. With the planet modeling package, VPLanet, we predict the evolution and anticipated current atmospheric conditions. Our Chandra observations indicate LTT 1445C as the dominant X-ray source, with additional contribution from LTT 1445B. LTT 1445A, a slowly-rotating star, exhibits no significant flare activity in the new Chandra dataset. Comparing the flux incident on the exoplanets, LTT 1445BC components do not pose a greater threat to the planets orbiting LTT 1445A than the emission from A itself. According to the results from the simulation, LTT 1445Ad might have the capacity to retain its water surface.</description>
