      <title>Parental Imprints On Birth Weight: A Data-Driven Model For Neonatal Prediction In Low Resource Prenatal Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight prediction is a cornerstone of prenatal care, yet traditional methods often rely on imaging technologies that remain inaccessible in resource-limited settings. This study presents a novel machine learning-based framework that circumvents these conventional dependencies, using a diverse set of physiological, environmental, and parental factors to refine birth weight estimation. A multi-stage feature selection pipeline filters the dataset into an optimized subset, demonstrating previously underexplored yet clinically relevant predictors of fetal growth. By integrating advanced regression architectures and ensemble learning strategies, the model captures non-linear relationships often overlooked by traditional approaches, offering a predictive solution that is both interpretable and scalable. Beyond predictive accuracy, this study addresses a question: whether birth weight can be reliably estimated without conventional diagnostic tools. The findings challenge entrenched methodologies by introducing an alternative pathway that enhances accessibility without compromising clinical utility. While limitations exist, the study lays the foundation for a new era in prenatal analytics, one where data-driven inference competes with, and potentially redefines, established medical assessments. By bridging computational intelligence with obstetric science, this research establishes a framework for equitable, technology-driven advancements in maternal-fetal healthcare.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Assessment of Aircraft Noise Exposure Using Mobile Phone-Derived Population Estimates and High-Resolution Noise Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aircraft noise exposure has traditionally been assessed using static residential population data and long-term average noise metrics, often overlooking the dynamic nature of human mobility and temporal variations in operational conditions. This study proposes a data-driven framework that integrates high-resolution noise measurements from airport monitoring terminals with mobile phone-derived de facto population estimates to evaluate noise exposure with fine spatio-temporal resolution. We develop hourly noise exposure profiles and quantify the number of individuals affected across regions and time windows, using both absolute counts and inequality metrics such as Gini coefficients. This enables a nuanced examination of not only who is exposed, but when and where the burden is concentrated. At our case study airport, operational runway patterns resulted in recurring spatial shifts in noise exposure. By incorporating de facto population data, we demonstrate that identical noise operations can yield unequal impacts depending on the time and location of population presence, highlighting the importance of accounting for population dynamics in exposure assessment. Our approach offers a scalable basis for designing population-sensitive noise abatement strategies, contributing to more equitable and transparent aviation noise management.</description>

      <title>A conceptual synthesis of causal assumptions for causal discovery and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual synthesis of causal discovery and inference frameworks, with a focus on how foundational assumptions -- causal sufficiency, causal faithfulness, and the causal Markov condition -- are formalized and operationalized across methodological traditions. Through structured tables and comparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices from multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and differences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers designing causal studies, especially in settings where observational or experimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all phases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of background knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study design or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support rigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.</description>
