      <title>Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fifteenth International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (NCMA 2025) was held in Loughborough, UK, on July 21 and 22, 2025, organized by the Department of Computer Science at Loughborough University and co-located with the 26th International Conference on Descriptional Complexity of Formal Systems (DCFS 2025, 22-24 July).
  The NCMA workshop series was established in 2009 as an annual event for researchers working on non-classical and classical models of automata, grammars or related devices. Such models are investigated both as theoretical models and as formal models for applications from various points of view. The goal of the NCMA workshop series is to exchange and develop novel ideas in order to gain deeper and interdisciplinary coverage of this particular area that may foster new insights and substantial progress.</description>

      <title>On finite extensions of lamplighter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>
