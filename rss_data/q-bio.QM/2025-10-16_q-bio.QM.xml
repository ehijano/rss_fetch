      <title>ST2HE: A Cross-Platform Framework for Virtual Histology and Annotation of High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (HR-ST) technologies offer unprecedented insights into tissue architecture but lack standardized frameworks for histological annotation. We present ST2HE, a cross-platform generative framework that synthesizes virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images directly from HR-ST data. ST2HE integrates nuclei morphology and spatial transcript coordinates using a one-step diffusion model, enabling histologically faithful image generation across diverse tissue types and HR-ST platforms. Conditional and tissue-independent variants support both known and novel tissue contexts. Evaluations on breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrate ST2HE's ability to preserve morphological features and support downstream annotations of tissue histology and phenotype classification. Ablation studies reveal that larger context windows, balanced loss functions, and multi-colored transcript visualization enhance image fidelity. ST2HE bridges molecular and histological domains, enabling interpretable, scalable annotation of HR-ST data and advancing computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Protenix-Mini+: efficient structure prediction model with scalable pairformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12842v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g., Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1) compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2) removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and (3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Omni-QALAS: Optimized Multiparametric Imaging for Simultaneous T1, T2 and Myelin Water Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13118v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To improve the accuracy of multiparametric estimation, including myelin water fraction (MWF) quantification, and reduce scan time in 3D-QALAS by optimizing sequence parameters, using a self-supervised multilayer perceptron network. Methods: We jointly optimize flip angles, T2 preparation durations, and sequence gaps for T1 recovery using a self-supervised MLP trained to minimize a Cramer-Rao bound-based loss function, with explicit constraints on total scan time. The optimization targets white matter, gray matter, and myelin water tissues, and its performance was validated through simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: Building on our previously proposed MWF-QALAS method for simultaneous MWF, T1, and T2 mapping, the optimized sequence reduces the number of readouts from six to five and achieves a scan time nearly one minute shorter, while also yielding higher T1 and T2 accuracy and improved MWF maps. This sequence enables simultaneous multiparametric quantification, including MWF, at 1 mm isotropic resolution within 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that optimizing sequence parameters using a self-supervised MLP network improved T1, T2 and MWF estimation accuracy, while reducing scan time.</description>

      <title>qLOOK: A Minimal Information System for Digital Storage and Reproducible Analysis of qPCR experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Quantitative real-time PCR is widely used for gene expression analysis, yet inconsistencies in data storage and reporting limit reproducibility. While MIQE guidelines define the minimal information required for publication, they do not specify structured digital storage formats compatible with long-term reanalysis. This work presents qLOOK (qPCR-LOg-boOK), a tool for standardized digital storage and reproducible analysis of qPCR experiments. Results: qLOOK is a modular R-based system that extracts data from Thermo Fisher/ABI .EDS files, formats it into a structured table (qLOOK_Data.xlsx), performs normalization and statistical analysis, and generates a log file (qLOOK_Summary.txt) recording reference genes, calibrators, and analytical parameters. All required R libraries are automatically installed and loaded, allowing researchers without coding experience to use the scripts. By preserving the qLOOK_Data table and the qLOOK_Summary log, users can reproduce or extend analyses without reprocessing raw files. While currently limited to .EDS files, the modular design allows adaptation to additional qPCR formats in the future. Besides providing an easy and transparent approach to analyze qPCR experiments, qLOOK also provides a minimal, standardized, and transparent solution for digital documentation, enhancing reproducibility, supporting long-term data stewardship, and facilitating integration into electronic laboratory notebooks or publication supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central task in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present Phyloformer 2, the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. Phyloformer 2 exploits a novel encoding for pairs of sequences that makes it more scalable than previous approaches, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution, and outperforms both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under realistic models of sequence evolution.</description>

      <title>Escaping Local Optima in the Waddington Landscape: A Multi-Stage TRPO-PPO Approach for Single-Cell Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However, these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet, an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Holographic Agglutination Assay for Immunoglobulin A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Holographic Agglutination Assay for quantifying levels of the immunoglobulin protein IgA in biological samples. This is the first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective agglutination.
  By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 {\mu}M) to high (320 mg/dL, 20 {\mu}M) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing IgA from samples containing IgG.
  More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.</description>

      <title>Spherical Radiomics - A Novel Approach to Glioblastoma Radiogenomic Analysis of Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Dengue in Recife, Brazil (2015-2024): The Role of Spatial Granularity and Data Quality for Epidemiological Risk Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models for Replication Origin Spacings in Eukaryotic DNA Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replication of genetic material is an important process for all living organisms. Origins of replication initiate the copying of DNA at many points on a chromosome, and it is the distribution of these points that is relevant here, as it presents us with an interesting stochastic process. It was observed by Newman et al. that for various types of yeast cells, there were fewer very small inter-origin spacings, and fewer very large inter-origin spacings in the replication origin data than would be expected if the origins were uncorrelated, random points. We propose a very simple stochastic model for DNA replication and determine that this probabilistic process produces replication origins that display repulsion between origins and relative scarcity of large spacings. We detail some connections between this model and existing polynuclear or polymer growth models.</description>

      <title>Software System for Low-Cost, GUI-Based Microscopy Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>Enabling Few-Shot Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Biomarker Data with Tabular LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</description>

Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.</description>
