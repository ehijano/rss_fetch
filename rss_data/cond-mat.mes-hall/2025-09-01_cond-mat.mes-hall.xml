      <title>Phonon-scattering-induced quantum linear magnetoresistance up to room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring Co, Fe, and Ni Reference Layers for Single-Pulse All-Optical Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an essential condition for triggering its reversal.</description>

      <title>Remote spin control in Haldane spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the remote manipulation of the quantum state of the edge fractional spins of Haldane spin chains using a weak local perturbation on the other edge. We derive an effective four-level model that correctly captures the response of the local magnetization to local perturbations and we use it to show that applying a small local field on one edge of the chain induces a strong variation of the magnetization on the opposite edge. Using a Landau-Zener protocol, we show how local control of the field on one edge of the chain, implemented for instance with a spin-polarized scanning tunnel microscope tip, can adiabatically switch the magnetization direction on the other side of the chain.</description>

      <title>Tapping-mode SQUID-on-tip Microscopy with Proximity Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying nanoscale dynamics is essential for understanding quantum materials and advancing quantum chip manufacturing. Still, it remains a major challenge to measure non-equilibrium properties such as current and dissipation, and their relation to structure. Scanning nanoprobes utilizing superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are uniquely suited here, due to their unparalleled magnetic and thermal sensitivity. Here, we introduce tapping-mode SQUID-on-tip, which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanoSQUID sensing. Our probes minimize nanoSQUID-sample distance, provide in-plane magnetic sensitivity, and operate without lasers. Frequency multiplexing enables simultaneous imaging of currents, magnetism, dissipation and topography. The large voltage output of our proximity-junction nanoSQUIDs allows us to resolve nanoscale currents as small as 100 nA using a simple four-probe electronic readout without cryogenic amplification. By capturing local magnetic, thermal, and electronic response without external radiation, our technique offers a powerful non-invasive route to study dynamic phenomena in exotic materials and delicate quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>High fidelity flopping-mode single spin operation with tuning inter-dot orbital levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast spin manipulation and long spin coherence time in quantum dots are essential features for high fidelity semiconductor spin qubits. However, generally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties simultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from each other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous tuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the material-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field gradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we demonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning inter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the third dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an electrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper tuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine learning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency using past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low frequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally, we demonstrate a $\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\% with a gate time of 4 ns through randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where electron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity spin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific parameters rather than relying on material properties or external field gradients.</description>

      <title>Topological Magnon Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the synergy between topological physics and nonlinear dynamics unveils profound insights into emergent states of matter. Inspired by recent experimental demonstrations of topological frequency combs in photonics, we theoretically introduce topological magnon frequency combs (MFCs) in a two-dimensional triangular skyrmion lattice. Computing the Chern numbers of magnon bands reveals robust chiral edge states. Strikingly, these topological MFCs originate from nonlinear four-magnon scattering among the chiral edge modes, activated by dual-frequency driving without an amplitude threshold. Comb spacings are readily tunable through excitation frequency detuning. Micromagnetic simulations validate our predictions with good concordance. This work paves the way for defect-immune magnonic devices exploiting MFCs and sparks investigations into topological-nonlinear phenomena in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave induced gapped nodal line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and topological nodal-line states in square-net materials. Our Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases, eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at $\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but finite $\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent explanation for recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Jetting with gels: Soft microgel networks stabilize and extend nozzle-free water jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging from precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally limited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to use surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause conventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to stabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of PNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this limitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial networks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery, delay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up to 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain, leading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in soft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced effective surface tension. Finally, a simple scaling analysis, balancing the SAW-driven kinetic energy imparted to the droplet against the surface energy required to form a jet, quantitatively predicts the observed length enhancement. This surfactant-free, biocompatible approach lays the foundation for long-lived jets, enabling precision needle-free drug delivery, high-speed printing, and other high-strain interfacial flow applications.</description>

      <title>LREI: A fast numerical solver for quantum Landau-Lifshitz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop LREI (Low-Rank Eigenmode Integration), a memory- and time-efficient scheme for solving quantum Landau-Lifshitz (q-LL) and quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (q-LLG) equations, which govern spin dynamics in open quantum systems. Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.</description>

      <title>Bright yet dark: how strong coupling quenches exciton-polariton radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and quantum polaritonic applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations in magnetized helical edge states coupled to s-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Two-Dimensional Electron Gas at the Interfaces of Ferroelectric Potassium Tantalate Niobates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterointerfaces at complex oxides have emerged as a promising platform for discovering novel physical phenomena and advancing integrated sensing, storage, and computing technologies. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a ferroelectric oxide-based field-effect transistor (FET) configuration remains challenging. Here, we firstly demonstrate a tunable 2DEG system fabricated by depositing an amorphous LaAlO3(LAO) film onto a (001)-oriented ferroelectric potassium tantalate niobate substrate. Interfaces grown under high-temperature and high-oxygen-pressure conditions exhibit a good metallic conduction. Notably, well-defined metallic 2DEGs displaying pronounced hysteresis and persistent electric-field-modulated resistance are observed below 108 K, achieving a resistance modulation of 11.6% at 7 K. These results underscore the potential for extending such behavior to other oxide-based 2DEG systems and facilitate further exploration of ferroelectric metals in complex oxide heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: We study a mean-field model for a system of 2D abelian anyons, given by the dynamics of a Schr{\"o}dinger matter field coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. We derive an effective 1D equation by adding a strongly anisotropic trapping potential (wave-guide) acting on the Schr{\"o}dinger field, and tracing out the tight confinement direction. The effective dynamics in the loose direction of the wave-guide turns out to be governed by the classical 1D quintic NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode (whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance. To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...</description>

      <title>Chemical Control of Mechanical Anisotropy and Band Alignment in Perylene-based Two-dimensional MoS$_2$-Organic Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of hybrid interfaces formed by monolayer MoS$_2$ coupled with the organic molecules perylene (P), perylene diimide (PDI), and perylene orange (PO). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate the extent to which the mechanical and electronic properties of a hybrid system can be altered by the chemical modification of a given chromophore. The three systems exhibit distinct differences due to their chemical composition and van der Waals contact enabled by their geometry. All systems are structurally stable. The binding energies follow the order PD$&gt;$P$&gt;$PO due to the large $\pi$-system (PD) and strong structural distortion (PO). Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio exhibit pronounced anisotropy in all cases. PO exhibits the greatest anisotropy due to steric effects and a permanent dipole, which introduce directionality to the molecule-surface interaction. Physisorption is accompanied by net charge transfer in the same order as the binding energies. The associated interfacial polarization results in a change in the work function compared to pristine MoS$_2$ in the order P$&gt;$PO$&gt;$PD. Finally, the presence of organic molecules introduces states into the MoS$_2$ energy gap, with the band alignment being either type II (P, PO) or type I (PD).</description>

      <title>Experimental Construction of NOON State Dynamics in Photonic Flat Band Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of path-entangled multi-photon NOON states in a flat-band photonic rhombic lattice and observe intriguing localization-delocalization features that depend on the phase as well as the photon number of the NOON states. To experimentally emulate photon number correlations, we develop an intensity correlation measurement protocol using coherent laser light with tunable relative phases. We first apply this protocol to show spatial bunching and anti-bunching of two-photon NOON states in a one-dimensional lattice consisting of identical waveguides. In the case of the rhombic lattice, we show that for an even (odd) photon number $N$, localization occurs at $0 \, (\pi)$ phase of the NOON state with a probability of $2^{1-N}$. Our results open an exciting route toward predicting quantum interference of correlated photons in complex photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Induced Kekul\'{e} Superconductivity in Haldane phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekul\`{e} superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Effect of Inversion Asymmetry on Bilayer Graphene's Superconducting and Exciton Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry. We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's exciton condensate.</description>

Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) belongs to the most fundamental phenomena of solid state physics and has an important application as resistance standard. It serves as a basis to understand the fractional, anomalous or spin QHEs, candidates for applications in quantum technology due to their topological properties. For optimizing all these applications it is essential to understand where the current flows inside the Hall bar, a question disputed for decades. We perform multiterminal current measurements on a Hall bar and compare the results with limiting models. We confirm, based on these experiments, that the current flow is chiral for the plateaus of quantized Hall resistance. Everywhere else, including the ranges between plateaus, our results comply with the Drude model, which predicts homogeneous current flow across a homogeneous Hall-bar.</description>

Abstract: A charge qubit couples to environmental electric field fluctuations through its dipole moment, resulting in fast decoherence. We propose the p orbital (pO) qubit, formed by the single electron, p-like valence states of a five-electron Si quantum dot, which couples to charge noise through the quadrupole moment. We demonstrate that the pO qubit offers distinct advantages in quality factor, gate speed, readout and size. We use a phenomenological, dipole two-level-fluctuator charge noise model to estimate a $T_2^* \sim 80$ ns. In conjunction with Rabi frequencies of order 10 GHz, an order of magnitude improvement in qubit quality factor is expected relative to state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubits. The pO qubit features all-electrical control via modulating the dot's eccentricity. We also show how to perform two-qubit gates via the $1/r^5$ quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. We find a universal gate set using gradient ascent based control pulse optimization, subject to 10 GHz maximum allowable bandwidth and 1 ns pulse times.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric superlattice systems with complex potentials of periodic sets of two $\delta$-potentials in the elementary cell. In the presence of periodic gain and loss we analyzed in detail a diatomic crystal model, varying either the scatterer distances or the potential heights. It is shown that at a certain critical value of the imaginary part of the complex amplitude, topological states depending on the lattice size and the configuration of the unit cell can disappear. This may happened at the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking (exceptional) points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in nearly-spherical molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2\,+\,2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in theJosephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Cashier effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Cashier effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states.

      <title>Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</description>

      <title>Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the Neel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet-$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, for typical disorder in the qubit frequencies the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. Our results, which we also confirm using generalized Bose-Hubbard models, support designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals, which may also be observed in many-body localized states, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics, from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal states (NEMs) without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into a fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find robust evidence of the emergence of NEMs that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Robust translational invariance in topological bands against lattice potentials and disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically show that the continuous magnetic translational invariance within the Hilbert (sub-)space of a single Landau level (LL) can persist even in the presence of a superlattice electrostatic potential modulation, while such invariance is broken in the full real-space Hilbert space. This is due to the interplay of the superlattice constant and the fundamental length scale of the quantum Hall fluids. In particular for the lowest LL (LLL), when the spacing of superlattice is below the magnetic length, continuous magnetic translational symmetry is very robust. For the fractional quantum Hall phases, the continuous translational symmetry is preserved when the superlattice spacing is below the corresponding fundamental lengths which we can now quantitatively define, which is different from the length scale from the quantum metric. Moreover, our analysis implies that the dynamics of the anyonic excitations can be robust against the long wavelength part of the disorder, and we discuss the related experimental ramifications.</description>

      <title>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Phase-matched electron-photon interactions enabled by 3D-printed helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Smith-Purcell effect enables electromagnetic radiation across arbitrary spectral ranges by phase-matching the diffraction orders of an optical grating with the near-field of a moving electron. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using a helically shaped waveguide, where phase-matching is achieved through guided light within a helical optical fiber fabricated via two-photon polymerization using a 3D printer. Our results demonstrate that radiation from these structures precisely satisfies the phase-matching condition and is emitted directionally at specific angles, contrasting with the broad angular distribution characteristic of the traditional Smith-Purcell effect. Helical electron-driven photon sources establish a new paradigm, enabling 3D-printed structures to control electron-beam-induced radiation and, inversely, to facilitate light-induced efficient electron beam shaping and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced back-action in a QD-based coherent spin-photon interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</description>
