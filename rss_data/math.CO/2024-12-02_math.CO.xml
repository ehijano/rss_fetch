      <title>A sharp spectral extremal result for general non-bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph family $\mathcal F$, let $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{spex}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the maximum number of edges and maximum spectral radius of an $n$-vertex $\mathcal F$-free graph, respectively, and let $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the corresponding sets of extremal graphs. Wang, Kang, and Xue showed that if $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ consists of Tur\'an graphs $T_{n,r}$ plus $O(1)$ edges, then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough. Fang, Tait, and Zhai extended this result by showing if $e(T_{n,r})\le\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F) &lt; e(T_{n,r})+\lfloor n/2r\rfloor$ then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough. In this paper we extend the result further and in many cases we can show that our result is best possible, answering a question of Fang, Tait, and Zhai.</description>

      <title>Generalized snake posets, order polytopes, and lattice-point enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building from the work of von Bell et al.~(2022), we study the Ehrhart theory of order polytopes arising from a special class of distributive lattices, known as generalized snake posets. We present arithmetic properties satisfied by the Ehrhart polynomials of order polytopes of generalized snake posets along with a computation of their Gorenstein index. Then we give a combinatorial description of the chain polynomial of generalized snake posets as a direction to obtain the $h^*$-polynomial of their associated order polytopes. Additionally, we present explicit formulae for the $h^*$-polynomial of the order polytopes of the two extremal examples of generalized snake posets, namely the ladder and regular snake poset. We then provide a recursive formula for the $h^*$-polynomial of any generalized snake posets and show that the $h^*$-vectors are entry-wise bounded by the $h^*$-vectors of the two extremal cases.</description>

      <title>Near rainbow Hamilton cycles in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding near-rainbow Hamilton cycles in properly edge-coloured graphs was first studied by Andersen, who proved in 1989 that every proper edge colouring of the complete graph on $n$ vertices contains a Hamilton cycle with at least $n-\sqrt{2n}$ distinct colours. This result was improved to $n-O(\log^2 n)$ by Balogh and Molla in 2019.
  In this paper, we consider Anderson's problem for general graphs with a given minimum degree. We prove every globally $n/8$-bounded (i.e. every colour is assigned to at most $n/8$ edges) properly edge-coloured graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq (1/2+\varepsilon)n$ contains a Hamilton cycle with $n-o(n)$ distinct colours. Moreover, we show that the constant $1/8$ is best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the exponential growth of the cardinality of the set of numbers of spanning trees in simple (and planar) graphs on $n$ vertices, answering a question of Sedl\'a\v{c}ek from 1969. The proof uses a connection with continued fractions, ``thin orbits,'' and Zaremba's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Improved upper bounds on Zarankiewicz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $s,t,m$ and $n$, the Zarankiewicz number $z(m,n;s,t)$ is the maximum number of edges in a subgraph of $K_{m,n}$ that has no complete bipartite subgraph containing $s$ vertices in the part of size $m$ and $t$ vertices in the part of size $n$. The best general upper bound on Zarankiewicz numbers is a bound due to Roman that can be viewed as the optimal value of a simple linear program. Here we show that in many cases this bound can be improved by adding additional constraints to this linear program. This allows us to computationally find new upper bounds on Zarankiewicz numbers for many small parameter sets. We are also able to establish a new family of closed form upper bounds on $z(m,n;s,t)$ that captures much, but not all, of the power of the new constraints. This bound generalises a recent result of Chen, Horsley and Mammoliti that applied only in the case $s=2$.</description>

      <title>A Partial Characterization of Robinsonian $L^p$ Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a characterization of Robinsonian $L^p$ graphons for $p &gt; 5$. Each $L^p$ graphon $w$ is the limit object of a sequence of edge density-normalized simple graphs $\{G_n/\|G_n\|_1\}$ under the cut distance $\delta_{\Box}$. A graphon $w$ is Robinson if it satisfies the Robinson property: if $x\leq y\leq z$, then $w(x,z)\leq \min\{w(x,y),w(y,z)\}$, and it is Robinsonian if $\delta_{\Box}(w,u)=0$ for some Robinson $u$. In previous work, the author and collaborators introduced a graphon parameter $\Lambda$ that recognizes the Robinson property, where $\Lambda(w) = 0$ precisely when $w$ is Robinson. Using functional analytic arguments, we show here that for $p &gt; 5$, the Robinsonian $L^p$ graphons $w$ are precisely those that are the cut distance limit object of graphs $G_n$ such that $\Lambda(G_n/\|G_n\|_1) \to 0$.</description>

      <title>A database of constructions of Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadamard matrices of order $n$ are conjectured to exist whenever $n$ is $1$, $2$, or a multiple of $4$; a similar conjecture exists for skew Hadamard matrices. We provide constructions covering orders $\le 1208$ of all known Hadamard and skew Hadamard matrices in the open-source software SageMath. This allowed us to verify the correctness of results given in the literature. Within this range, just one order, $292$, of a skew Hadamard matrix claimed to have a known construction, required a fix.
  We also produce the up to date tables, for $n \le 2999$ (resp. $n\le 999$ for skew case), of the minimum exponents $m$ such that a (skew) Hadamard matrix of order $2^m n$ is known, improving over 100 entries in the previously published sources. We explain how tables' entries are related to Riesel numbers. As a by-product of the latter, we show that the Paley constructions of (skew-)Hadamard matrices do not work for the order $2^m 509203$, for any $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all the finite groups $G$ such that the commuting graph $\Gamma_C(G)$, order-sum graph $\Gamma_{OS}(G)$ and non-inverse graph $\Gamma_{NI}(G)$ are minimally edge connected graphs. We also classify all the finite groups $G$ for that, these graphs are minimally connected. We also classify some groups for that the co-prime graph $\Gamma_{CP}(G)$ has minimal edge connectedness. In final part, we classify all the finite groups $G$ for that co-prime graph $\Gamma_{CP}(G)$ is minimally connected.</description>

      <title>Generalized degree polynomials of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized degree polynomial $\mathbf{G}_T(x,y,z)$ of a tree $T$ is an invariant introduced by Crew that enumerates subsets of vertices by size and number of internal and boundary edges. Aliste-Prieto et al. proved that $\mathbf{G}_T$ is determined linearly by the chromatic symmetric function $\mathbf{X}_T$, introduced by Stanley. We present several classes of information about $T$ that can be recovered from $\mathbf{G}_T$ and hence also from $\mathbf{X}_T$. Examples of such information include the double-degree sequence of $T$, which enumerates edges of $T$ by the pair of degrees of their endpoints, and the leaf adjacency sequence of $T$, which enumerates vertices of $T$ by degree and number of adjacent leaves. We also discuss a further generalization of $\mathbf{G}_T$ that enumerates tuples of vertex sets and show that this is also determined by $\mathbf{X}_T$.</description>

      <title>Complexity Issues Concerning the Quadruple Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)$, a mapping $h : V(G) \rightarrow \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace$ is called a quadruple Roman dominating function (4RDF) for $G$ if it holds the following. Every vertex $x$ such that $h(x)\in \{0,1,2, 3\}$ satisfies that $h(N[x]) = \sum_{v\in N[x]} h(v) \geq |\{y:y \in N(x) \; \text{and} \; h(y) \neq 0\}|+4$, where $N(x)$ and $N[x]$ stands for the open and closed neighborhood of $x$, respectively. The smallest possible weight $\sum_{x \in V(G)} h(x)$ among all possible 4RDFs $h$ for $G$ is the quadruple Roman domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{[4R]}(G)$.
  This work is focused on complexity aspects for the problem of computing the value of this parameter for several graph classes. Specifically, it is shown that the decision problem concerning $\gamma_{[4R]}(G)$ is NP-complete when restricted to star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, split and planar graphs. In contrast, it is also proved that such problem can be efficiently solved for threshold graphs where an exact solution is demonstrated, while for graphs having an efficient dominating set, tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the classical domination number are given. In addition, some approximation results to the problem are given. That is, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within $(1 - \epsilon) \ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ unless $P=NP$. An approximation algorithm for it is proposed, and its APX-completeness proved, whether graphs of maximum degree four are considered. Finally, an integer linear programming formulation for our problem is presented.</description>

      <title>Optimal $L(2,1)$-labeling of certain strong graph bundles cycles over cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $L(2,1)$-labeling of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a function $f$ from the vertex set $V(G)$ to the set of nonnegative integers such that the labels on adjacent vertices differ by at least two, and the labels on vertices at distance two differ by at least one. The span of $f$ is the difference between the largest and the smallest numbers of $f(V)$. The $\lambda$-number of $G$, denoted by $\lambda (G)$, is the minimum span over all $L(2,1)$-labelings of $G$. We prove that if $X= C_m\boxtimes^{\sigma_\ell} C_{n}$ is a direct graph bundle with fiber $C_{n}$ and base $C_m$, $n$ is a multiple of 11 and $\ell$ has a form of $\ell =[11k+(-1)^a 4m]\mod n$ or of $\ell =[11k+(-1)^a 3m]\mod n$, where $a\in \{1,2\}$ and $k\in \ZZ$, then $\lambda (X)=10$.</description>

      <title>On $(k,g)$-Graphs without $(g+1)$-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graph is a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ which does not contain cycles of length $g+1$. Such graphs are known to exist for all parameter pairs $k \geq 3, g \geq 3 $, and we focus on determining the orders $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ of the smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the previously studied Girth-Pair Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph in which the length of a smallest even length cycle and the length of a smallest odd length cycle are prescribed. When considering the case of an odd girth $g$, this problem also yields results towards the Cage Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We establish the monotonicity of the function $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ with respect to increasing $g$, and present universal lower bounds for the values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$. We propose an algorithm for generating all $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs on $n$ vertices, use this algorithm to determine several of the smaller values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$, and discuss various approaches to finding smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs within several classes of highly symmetrical graphs.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy theorem on the complexity of 3-uniform hypergraphic degree sequence graphicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dichotomy theorem on the parameterized complexity of the 3-uniform hypergraphicality problem. Given $0&lt;c_1\le c_2 &lt; 1$, the parameterized 3-uniform Hypergraphic Degree Sequence problem, $3uni-HDS_{c_1,c_2}$, considers degree sequences $D$ of length $n$ such that all degrees are between $c_1 {n-1 \choose 2}$ and $c_2 {n-1\choose 2}$ and it asks if there is a 3-uniform hypergraph with degree sequence $D$. We prove that for any $0&lt;c_2&lt; 1$, there exists a unique, polynomial-time computable $c_1^*$ with the following properties. For any $ c_1\in (c_1^*,c_2]$, $3uni-HDS_{c_1,c_2}$ can be solved in linear time. In fact, for any $c_1\in (c_1^*,c_2]$ there exists an easy-to-compute $n_0$ such that any degree sequence $D$ of length $n\ge n_0$ and all degrees between $c_1 {n-1\choose 2}$ and $c_2 {n-1\choose 2}$ has a 3-uniform hypergraph realization if and only if the sum of the degrees can be divided by $3$. Further, $n_0$ grows polynomially with the inverse of $c_1-c_1^*$. On the other hand, we prove that for all $c_1&lt;c_1^*$, $3uni-HDS_{c_1,c_2}$ is NP-complete. Finally, we briefly consider an extension of the hypergraphicality problem to arbitrary $t$-uniformity. We show that the interval where degree sequences (satisfying divisibility conditions) always have $t$-uniform hypergraph realizations must become increasingly narrow, with interval width tending to $0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a bound on the girth g of a quaternion unit gain graph in terms of the rank r of its adjacency matrix. In particular, we show that g &lt;= r + 2 and characterize all quaternion unit gain graphs for which g = r+2. This extends corresponding results for (ordinary) graphs, signed graphs, and complex unit gain graphs.</description>

      <title>Extension on spectral extrema of gem-free graph with given size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $F$-free if $G$ does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Let $\mathcal{G}(m, F)$ denote the family of $F$-free graphs with $m$ edges and without isolated vertices. Let $S_{n,k}$ denote the graph obtained by joining every vertex of $K_{k}$ to $n-k$ isolated vertices and $S_{n,k}^{t}$ denote the graph obtained from $S_{n-t,k}$ by attaching $t$ pendant vertices to the maximal degree vertex of $S_{n-t,k}$, respectively. Denote by $H_{n}$ the fan graph obtain from $n-1$-vertex path plus a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the path. Particularly, the graph $H_{5}$ is also known as the gem. Zhang and Wang [Discrete Math. 347(2024)114171] and Yu, Li and Peng [arXiv: 2404. 03423] showed that every gem-free graph $G$ with $m$ edges satisfies $\rho(G)\leq \rho(S_{\frac{m+3}{2},2})$. In this paper, we show that if $G\in \mathcal{G}(m, H_{5})\setminus S_{\frac{m+3}{2},2}$ be a graph of odd size $m\geq23$, then $\rho(G)\leq \rho(S_{\frac{m+5}{2},2}^{2})$, and equality holds if and only if $G\cong S_{\frac{m+5}{2},2}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths in $K_{s, s}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago, Galvin, Rival and Sands showed that every $K_{s, s}$-free graph containing an $n$-vertex path must contain an induced path of length $f(n)$, where $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Recently, it was shown by Duron, Esperet and Raymond that one can take $f(n)=(\log \log n)^{1/5-o(1)}$. In this note, we give a short self-contained proof that a $K_{s, s}$-free graphs with an $n$-vertex path contains an induced path of length at least $(\log \log n)^{1-o(1)}$, which comes closer to the best known upper bound $O((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for growing the denominator $r$ polygons containing a fixed number of lattice points and enumerate such polygons containing few lattice points for small $r$. We describe the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polygon in terms of boundary and interior point counts. Using this, we bound the coefficients of Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of denominator 2 polygons. In particular, we completely classify such polynomials in the case of zero interior points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rank (also known as protection number or leaf-height) of a vertex in a rooted tree is the minimum distance between the vertex and any of its leaf descendants. We consider the sum of ranks over all vertices (known as the security) in binary trees, and produce a classification of families of binary trees for which the security is maximized. In addition, extremal results relating to maximum rank among all vertices in families of trees is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate 1-factorisations in which the 2-regular graphs that occur as the union of a pair of 1-factors appear an equal number of times across the unions of all pairs of 1-factors in the 1-factorisation. We call such 1-factorisations balanced 1-factorisations (B1Fs) and we present some results on B1Fs of 3- and 4-regular circulant graphs.</description>

      <title>Multisets with few special directions and small weight codewords in Desarguesian planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tie together two well studied topics related to finite Desarguesian affine and projective planes. The first topic concerns directions determined by a set, or even a multiset, of points in an affine plane. The second topic concerns the linear code generated by the incidence matrix of a projective plane. We show how a multiset determining only $k$ special directions, in a modular sense, gives rise to a codeword whose support can be covered by $k$ concurrent lines. The reverse operation of going from a codeword to a multiset of points is trickier, but we describe a possible strategy and show some fruitful applications.
  Given a multiset of affine points, we use a bound on the degree of its so-called projection function to yield lower bounds on the number of special directions, both in an ordinary and in a modular sense.
  In the codes related to projective planes of prime order $p$, there exists an odd codeword, whose support is covered by 3 concurrent lines, but which is not a linear combination of these 3 lines. We generalise this codeword to codewords whose support is contained in an arbitrary number of concurrent lines. In case $p$ is large enough, this allows us to extend the classification of codewords from weight at most $4p-22$ to weight at most $5p-36$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elements of a finite field of prime order canonically correspond to the integers in an interval. This induces an ordering on the elements of the field. Using this ordering, Kiss and Somlai recently proved interesting properties of the set of points below the diagonal line. In this paper, we investigate the set of points lying below a parabola. We prove that in some sense, this set of points looks the same from all but two directions, despite having only one non-trivial automorphism. In addition, we study the sizes of these sets, and their intersection numbers with respect to lines.</description>

      <title>Signotopes with few plus signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrangements of pseudohyperplanes are widely studied in computational geometry. A rich subclass of pseudohyerplane arrangements, which has gained more attention in recent years, is the so-called signotopes. Introduced by Manin and Schechtman (1989), the higher Bruhat order is a natural order of $r$-signotopes on $n$ elements, with the signotope corresponding to the cyclic arrangement as the minimal element. In this paper, we show that the lower (and by symmetry upper) levels of this higher Bruhat order contain the same number of elements for a fixed difference $n-r$. This result implies that given the difference $d=n-r$ and $p$, the number of one-element extensions of the cyclic arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\R^d$ with at most $p$ points on one side of the extending pseudohyperplane does not depend on $n$, as long as $n \geq d + p$.</description>

      <title>Twin-free $K_r$-saturated Graphs and Maximally Independent Sets in $K_3$-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that two vertices are twins if they have the same neighbourhood and that a graph is $K_r$-saturated if it does not contain $K_r$ but adding any new edge to it creates a $K_r$. In 1964, Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal and Moon showed that $sat(n,K_r)=(r-2)n+o(n)$ for $r \geq 3$, where $sat(n,K_r)$ is the minimum number of edges in a $K_r$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices, and determined the unique extremal graph. This graph has many twins, leading us to define $tsat(n,K_r)$ to be the minimum number of edges in a twin-free $K_r$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices. We show that $(5 +2/3)n + o(n) \leq tsat(n,K_3) \leq 6n+o(n)$ and that $\left(r+2\right)n + o(n) \leq tsat(n,K_r) \leq (r+3)n+o(n)$ for $r \geq 4$. We also consider a variant of this problem where we additionally require the graphs to have large minimum degree. Both of these problems turn out be intimately related to two other problems regarding maximally independent sets of a given size in $K_3$-free graphs and generalisations of these problems to $K_r$ with $r \geq 4$. The first problem is to maximise the number of maximally independent sets given the number of vertices and the second problem is to minimise the number of edges given the number of maximally independent sets. They are interesting in their own right.</description>

      <title>The Quaternary Gray Code and How It Can Be Used to Solve Ziggurat and Other Ziggu Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to the new "Ziggu" family of exponential puzzles. These puzzles have $p$ pieces that form $m$ mazes. We encode the puzzle state as an quaternary number (base $4$) with $n=m+1$ digits, where each digit gives the horizontal or vertical position in one maze. We show that the number of states on a shortest solution is $6 \cdot 2^n - 3n - 5$ (OEIS A101946). This solution is unique, and it is generated from the start as follows: make the leftmost modification that doesn't undo the previous modification. Replacing "leftmost" with "rightmost" instead generates the unique longest solution that visits all $(3^{n+1} - 1)/2$ states (OEIS A003462). Thus, Ziggu puzzles can be viewed as $4$-ary, $3$-ary, or $2$-ary puzzles based on how the number of state encodings, valid states, or minimum states grow with each additional maze.
  Classic Gray code puzzles (e.g., Spin-Out) provide natural comparisons. Gray code puzzles with $p$ pieces have $2^p$ (OEIS A000079) or $\lfloor \frac{2}{3} \cdot 2^p \rfloor$ (OEIS A000975) states on their unique solution. The states visited in a Gray code puzzle solution follow the binary reflected Gray code. We show that Ziggu puzzles follow the quaternary reflected Gray code, as the shortest and longest solutions are both sublists of this order.
  These results show how to solve Ziggu puzzles from the start. We also provide $O(n)$-time ranking, comparison, and successor algorithms, which give the state's position along a solution, the relative order of two states, and the next state, respectively. While Gray code puzzles have simpler recursive descriptions and successor rules, the Ziggu puzzle has a simpler loopless algorithm to generate its shortest solution. The two families share a comparison function. Finally, we enrich the literature on OEIS A101946 by providing a bijection between Ziggu states and $2\times n$ Nurikabe grids.</description>

      <title>Connections between numbers counting certain permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-negative integer parameters $r,u,m,n$ define \begin{align*}
  \cal{D}(r,u,m,n) := \big\{\ \sigma\in \cal{S}_{r+n}\ \big|\ \sigma(x)=y \textrm{ for exactly } u \textrm{ pairs } (x,y) \textrm{ such that } 1\leq x,y\leq r \textrm{ and } \sigma(t)=t \textrm{ for exactly } m \textrm{ elements } r+1\leq t\leq r+n\ \big\} \end{align*} and \begin{align*}
  \cal{D}_{r,u,m}(n) := \big\{\ \sigma\in \cal{S}_{r+n}\ \big|\ \forall_{1\leq x&lt;y\leq r} \ x \textrm{ and } y \textrm{ are in disjoint cycles of } \sigma \textrm{ and } \sigma(z)=z \textrm{ for exactly } u \textrm{ elements } 1\leq z\leq r, \textrm{ and } \sigma(t)=t \textrm{ for exactly } m \textrm{ elements } r+1\leq t\leq r+n\ \big\}, \end{align*} where $\mathcal{S}_{n}$ denotes the set of all the permutations of $\{1,\ldots ,n\}$.
  In this paper we study connections between the sets $\mathcal{D}(r,u,m,n)$, $\mathcal{D}_{r,u,m}(n)$, and the sets of (some classes of) $r$-derangements. We rely mostly on counting arguments.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Programming for Pebbling Numbers of Lemke Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a configuration of indistinguishable pebbles on the vertices of a graph, a pebbling move consists of removing two pebbles from one vertex and placing one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number of a graph is the least integer such that any configuration with that many pebbles and any target vertex, some sequence of pebbling moves can place a pebble on the target. Graham's conjecture asserts that the pebbling number of the cartesian product of two graphs is at most the product of the two graphs' pebbling numbers. Products of so-called Lemke graphs are widely thought to be the most likely counterexamples to Graham's conjecture, provided one exists.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for computing pebbling numbers using bilevel optimization. We use this approach to algorithmically show that the pebbling numbers of all products of 8-vertex Lemke graphs are consistent with Graham's conjecture, with the added assumption that pebbles can only be placed on a set of at most four vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetrically self-similar graphs are an important type of fractal graph. Their Green functions satisfy order one iterative functional equations. We show when the branching number of a generating cell is two, either the graph is a star consisting of finitely many one-sided lines meeting at an origin vertex, in which case the Green function is algebraic, or the Green function is differentially transcendental over $\mathbb{C}(z)$. The proof strategy relies on a recent work of Di Vizio, Fernandes and Mishna. The result adds evidence to a conjecture of Kr\"on and Teufl about the spectrum of this family of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents examples of an application of the finite field method for the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the matching arrangement of a graph. Weight functions on edges of a graph with weights from a finite field are divided into proper and improper functions in connection with proper colorings of vertices of the matching polytope of a graph. An improper weight function problem is introduced, a proof of its NP-completeness is presented, and a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem is constructed based on the improper weight function problem.</description>

      <title>Paintbucket on graphs is PSPACE-complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Paintbucket was recently introduced by Amundsen and Erickson. It is played on a rectangular grid of black and white pixels. The players alternately fill in one of their opponent's connected components with their own color, until the entire board is just a single color. The player who makes the last move wins. It is not currently known whether there is a simple winning strategy for Paintbucket. In this paper, we consider a natural generalization of Paintbucket that is played on an arbitrary simple graph, and we show that the problem of determining the winner in a given position of this generalized game is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Counting Problems for Orthogonal Sets and Sublattices in Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}=\mathbb{F}_q((x^{-1}))$. Analogous to orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a well-studied notion of ultrametric orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, we extend the work of \cite{AB24} about counting results related to orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. For example, we answer an open question from \cite{AB24} by bounding the size of the largest ``orthogonal sets'' in $\mathcal{K}^n$. Furthermore, we investigate analogues of Hadamard matrices over $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we use orthogonality to compute the number of sublattices of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]^n$ with a certain geometric structure, as well as to determine the number of orthogonal bases for a sublattice in $\mathcal{K}^n$. The resulting formulas depend crucially on successive minima.</description>

Abstract: Arrow proved that for three or more candidates, the IIA condition is enough to forbid all non-dictatorial election rules (or Social Welfare Functions). Maskin introduced the weaker MIIA condition, which permits the ``Borda'' election rules where each voter assigns points linearly to each candidate according to their order of preference. However, in previous work we demonstrated that there exist Social Welfare Functions between three candidates and satisfying the MIIA condition which are far from being Borda rules.
  We demonstrate that this phenomenon is unique to the case of three candidates. As soon as a fourth candidate is introduced, and indeed for any larger number of candidates, the only good election rules are the unweighted Borda rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evra, Feigon, Maurischat, and Parzanchevski (2023) introduced a biregular extension of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we reformulate their definition and provide some basic properties. We also show how these Cayley incidence graphs relate to various notions of Cayley hypergraphs. We further establish connections between Cayley incidence graphs and certain geometric and combinatorial structures, including coset geometries, difference sets and cages.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph universality via branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, we say that a hypergraph $\Gamma$ is $\mathcal{H}$-universal if it contains every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ as a subgraph. For $D, r \in \mathbb{N}$, we construct an $r$-uniform hypergraph with $\Theta\left(n^{r - r/D} \log^{r/D}(n)\right)$ edges which is universal for the family of all $r$-uniform hypergraphs with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $D$. This almost matches a trivial lower bound $\Omega(n^{r - r/D})$ coming from the number of such hypergraphs.
  On a high level, we follow the strategy of Alon and Capalbo used in the graph case, that is $r = 2$. The construction of $\Gamma$ is deterministic and based on a bespoke product of expanders, whereas showing that $\Gamma$ is universal is probabilistic. Two key new ingredients are a decomposition result for hypergraphs of bounded density, based on Edmond's matroid partitioning theorem, and a tail bound for branching random walks on expanders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic game of Nim has been well-known for many years, inspiring numerous variations. One such variant is Delete Nim, where players take turns eliminating one pile of stones and splitting the remaining pile into two smaller piles. In this paper we generalize the game to include the case of n piles. On each turn, a player eliminates one pile and splits one of the remaining piles into two smaller piles. We specifically analyze the case where n=4, deriving the conditions for a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Chip games and multipartite graph paintability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the paintability, an on-line version of choosability, of complete multipartite graphs. We do this by considering an equivalent chip game introduced by Duraj, Gutowski, and Kozik. We consider complete multipartite graphs with $ n $ parts of size at most 3. Using a computational approach, we establish upper bounds on the paintability of such graphs for small values of $ n. $
  The choosability of complete multipartite graphs is closely related to value $ p(n, m) $, the minimum number of edges in a $n$-uniform hypergraph with no panchromatic $m$-coloring. We consider an online variant of this parameter $ p_{OL}(n, m), $ introduced by Khuzieva et al. using a symmetric chip game. With this symmetric chip game, we find an improved upper bound for $ p_{OL}(n, m)$ when $m \geq 3$ and $n$ is large. Our method also implies a lower bound on the paintability of complete multipartite graphs with $m \geq 3$ parts of equal size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we all know, the $k$-ary $n$-cube is a highly efficient interconnect network topology structure. It is also a concept of great significance, with a broad range of applications spanning both mathematics and computer science. In this paper, we study the existence of Hamiltonian cycles passing through prescribed matchings in $k$-ary $n$-cubes, and obtain the following result. For $n\geq5$ and $k\geq4$, every matching with at most $4n-20$ edges is contained in a Hamiltonian cycle in the $k$-ary $n$-cube.</description>

      <title>The omega invariant of a matroid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third author introduced the $g$-polynomial $g_M(t)$ of a matroid, a covaluative matroid statistic which is unchanged under series and parallel extension. The $g$-polynomial of a rank $r$ matroid $M$ has the form $g_1 t + g_2 t^2 + \cdots + g_r t^r$. The coefficient $g_1$ is Crapo's classical $\beta$-invariant. In this paper, we study the coefficient $g_r$, which we term the $\omega$-invariant of $M$. We show that, if $\omega(N)$ is nonnegative for every minor $N$ of $M$, then all the coefficients of $g_M(t)$ are nonnegative. We give several simplified versions of Ferroni's formula for $\omega(M)$, and compute $\omega(M)$ when $r$ or $|E(M)|-2r$ is small.</description>

Abstract: Bonamy et al. (2023) proved that an optimal edge coloring of a simple triangle--free graph $G$ can be reached from any given proper edge coloring of $G$ through a series of Kempe changes. We show that a small modification of their proof gives a possibility to obtain a similar result for a larger class of simple graphs consisting of all triangle-free and all chordless graphs (a graph $G$ is chordless if in every cycle $C$ of $G$ any two nonconsecutive vertices of $C$ are not adjacent).</description>

      <title>Bounds in radial Moore graphs of diameter 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial Moore graphs are approximations of Moore graphs that preserve the distance-preserving spanning tree for its central vertices. One way to classify their resemblance with a Moore graph is the status measure. The status of a graph is defined as the sum of the distances of all pairs of ordered vertices and equals twice the Wiener index. In this paper we study upper bounds for both the maximum number of central vertices and the status of radial Moore graphs. Finally, we present a family of radial Moore graphs of diameter $3$ that is conjectured to have maximum status.</description>

      <title>Exponential Schur and Hindman Theorem in Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a conjecture of A. Sisto, J. Sahasrabudhe proved the exponential version of the Schur theorem: for every finite coloring of the naturals, there exists a monochromatic copy of $\{x,y,x^y:x\neq y\},$ which initiates the study of exponential Ramsey theory in arithmetic combinatorics. In this article, We first give two short proofs of the exponential Schur theorem, one using Zorn's lemma and another using $IP_r^\star$ van der Waerden's theorem. Then using the polynomial van der Waerden theorem iteratively we give a proof of the exponential Hindman theorem. Then applying our results we prove for every natural number $m,n$ the equation $x_n^{x_{n-1}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{x_1}}}}}=y_1\cdots y_m$ is partition regular, which can be considered as the exponential version of a more general version of the P. Csikv\'{a}ri, K. Gyarmati, and A. S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy conjecture, which was solved by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman independently. As a consequence of our results, we also prove that for every finite partition of $\mathbb{N},$ there exists two different sequences $\langle x_n\rangle_n$ and $\langle y_n\rangle_n$ such that both the multiplicative and exponential version of Hindman theorem generated by these sequences resp. are monochromatic, whereas in the counterpart in the finitary case, J. Sahasrabudhe proved that both sequences are the same. Our result can be considered as an exponential analog to the result of V. Bergelson and N. Hindman. We also prove that a large class of ultrafilters with certain properties do not exist, which could give us direct proof of the exponential Schur theorem. This result can be thought of as partial evidence of the nonexistence of Galvin-Glazer's proof of the exponential Hindman theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975 Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di asked what minimum degree guarantees an octahedral subgraph $K_3(2)$ in any tripartite graph $G$ with $n$ vertices in each vertex class. We show that $\delta(G)\geq n+2n^{\frac{5}{6}}$ suffices thus improving the bound $n+(1+o(1))n^{\frac{11}{12}}$ of Bhalkikar and Zhao obtained by following their approach. Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di conjectured that $n+cn^{\frac{1}{2}}$ suffices and there are many $K_3(2)$-free tripartite graphs $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq n+cn^{\frac{1}{2}}$. We confirm this conjecture under the additional assumption that every vertex in $G$ is adjacent to at least $(1/5+\varepsilon)n$ vertices in any other vertex class.</description>

      <title>On Monitoring Edge-Geodetic Sets of Dynamic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set) in a graph $G$, denoted $MEG(G)$, refers to a subset of vertices $MEG(G)\subseteq V(G)$ such that every edge $e$ in $G$ is monitored by some pair of vertices $ u, v \in MEG(G)$, where $e$ lies on all shortest paths between $u$ and $v$. The minimum number of vertices required to form such a set is called the monitoring edge-geodetic number, denoted $meg(G)$. The primary motivation for studying $MEG$-sets in previous works arises from scenarios in which certain edges are removed from $G$. In these cases, the vertices of the $MEG$-set are responsible for detecting these deletions. Such detection is crucial for identifying which edges have been removed from $G$ and need to be repaired. In real life, repairing these edges may be costly, or sometimes it is impossible to repair edges. In this case, the original $MEG$-set may no longer be effective in monitoring the modified graph. This highlights the importance of reassessing and adapting the $MEG$-set after edge deletions. This work investigates the monitoring edge-geodetic properties of graphs, focusing on how the removal of $k$ edges affects the structure of a graph and influences its monitoring capabilities. Specifically, we explore how the monitoring edge-geodetic number $meg(G)$ changes when $k$ edges are removed. The study aims to compare the monitoring properties of the original graph with those of the modified graph and to understand the impact of edge deletions.</description>

      <title>Equitable coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two different color classes do not differ by more than one. We use $\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ to represent the class of graphs $G$ that satisfy the following conditions: for any subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality $e(H) \leq m_1 v(H)$ holds, and for any bipartite subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality $e(H) \leq m_2 v(H)$ holds. A graph $G$ is $\alpha$-sparse if $e(H) \leq \alpha v(H)$ for every subgraph $H$ of $G$.
  In this paper, we show that there is a small constant $r_0\in [4m_1, 6.21m_1]$ solely determined by both $m_1$ and $m_2$, such that for any graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ (where the ratio $m_1/m_2$ is between $1$ and $1.8$ inclusive) with a maximum degree $\Delta(G)\geq r_0$, an equitable $r$-coloring is guaranteed for all $r\geq \Delta(G)$. By setting $m_1=m_2=\alpha$ in this result, we conclude that every $\alpha$-sparse graph $G$ has an equitable $r$-coloring for every $r\geq \Delta(G)$ provided $\Delta(G)\geq 6.21\alpha$. Consequently, the celebrated Equitable $\Delta$-Color Conjecture and Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture are verified for sparse graphs with large maximum degree.
  The local crossing number of a drawing of a graph is the largest number of crossings on a single edge, and the local crossing number of that graph is the minimum of such values among all possible drawings. As an interesting application of our main result, we confirm Equitable $\Delta$-Color Conjecture and Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture for non-planar graphs $G$ with local crossing number not exceeding $\Delta(G)^2 / 383$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ten years ago, Moshkovitz and Shapira [\textit{Adv. Math.} \textbf{262} (2014), 1107--1129] determined the tower height for hypergraph Ramsey numbers of tight monotone paths. We address the color-avoiding version of this problem in which one no longer necessarily seeks a monochromatic subgraph, but rather one which \textit{avoids} some colors. This problem was previously studied in uniformity two by Loh and by Gowers and Long.
  We show, in general, that the tower height for such Ramsey numbers requires one fewer exponential than in the usual setting. The transition occurs at uniformity three, where the usual Ramsey numbers of monotone paths of length $n$ are exponential in $n$, but the color-avoiding Ramsey numbers turn out to be polynomial.</description>

      <title>Identification of a monotone Boolean function with $k$ "reasons" as a combinatorial search problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number of queries needed to identify a monotone Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. A query consists of a 0-1-sequence, and the answer is the value of $f$ on that sequence. It is well-known that the number of queries needed is $\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}+\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1}$ in general. Here we study a variant where $f$ has $k$ ``reasons'' to be 1, i.e., its disjunctive normal form has $k$ conjunctions if the redundant conjunctions are deleted. This problem is equivalent to identifying an upfamily in $2^{[n]}$ that has exactly $k$ minimal members. We find the asymptotics on the number of queries needed for fixed $k$. We also study the non-adaptive version of the problem, where the queries are asked at the same time, and determine the exact number of queries for most values of $k$ and $n$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a matrix for mixed graphs, called the integrated adjacency matrix. This matrix uniquely determines a mixed graph. Additionally, we associate an (undirected) graph with each mixed graph, enabling the spectral analysis of the integrated adjacency matrix to connect the structural properties of the mixed graph and its associated graph. Furthermore, we define certain mixed graph structures and establish their relationships to the eigenvalues of the integrated adjacency matrix.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for each integer $r\geq 2$, there exists a constant $C_r&gt;0$ with the following property: for any $0&lt;\varepsilon \leq 1/2$ and any graph $G$ with clique number at most $r,$ there is a partition of $V(G)$ into at most $(1/\varepsilon)^{C_r}$ sets $S_1, \dots, S_t,$ such that $G[S_i]$ has maximum degree at most $\varepsilon |S_i|$ for each $1 \leq i \leq t.$ This answers a question of Fox, Nguyen, Scott and Seymour, who proved a similar result for graphs with no induced $P_4.$</description>

      <title>Traits and tangles: An analysis of the Big Five paradigm by tangle-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recently developed mathematical theory of tangles, we re-assess the mathematical foundations for applications of the five factor model in personality tests by a new, mathematically rigorous, quantitative method. Our findings broadly confirm the validity of current tests, but also show that more detailed information can be extracted from existing data. We found that the big five traits appear at different levels of scrutiny. Some already emerge at a coarse resolution of our tools at which others cannot yet be discerned, while at a resolution where these _can_ be discerned, and distinguished, some of the former traits are no longer visible but have split into more refined traits or disintegrated altogether. We also identified traits other than the five targeted in those tests. These include more general traits combining two or more of the big five, as well as more specific traits refining some of them. All our analysis is structural and quantitative, and thus rigorous in explicitly defined mathematical terms. Since tangles, once computed, can be described concisely in terms of very few explicit statements referring only to the test questions used, our findings are also directly open to interpretation by experts in psychology. Tangle analysis can be applied similarly to other topics in psychology. Our paper is intended to serve as a first indication of what may be possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the closure of the coamoeba of a linear space/hyperplane complement is the union of products of coamoebas of hyperplane complements coming from flags of flats, and relate this to the Bergman fan. Using the Horn-Kapranov parameterization of a reduced discriminant, this gives a partial description of the phase limit sets of discriminants and duals of toric varieties. When d=3, we show that each 3-dimensional component of the phase limit set of the discriminant is a prism over a discriminant coamoeba in dimension 2, which has a polyhedral description by a result of Nilsson and Passare.</description>

      <title>A geometric invariant of linear rank-metric codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.</description>

      <title>Effective support, Dirac combs, and signal recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let
  $f: {\mathbb Z}_N^d \to {\mathbb C}$ be a signal with the Fourier transform $\widehat{f}: \Bbb Z_N^d\to \Bbb C$. A classical result due to Matolcsi and Szucs (\cite{MS73}), and, independently, to Donoho and Stark (\cite{DS89}) states if a subset of frequencies ${\{\widehat{f}(m)\}}_{m \in S}$ of $f$ are unobserved due to noise or other interference, then $f$ can be recovered exactly and uniquely provided that $$ |E| \cdot |S|&lt;\frac{N^d}{2},$$ where $E$ is the support of $f$, i.e., $E=\{x \in {\mathbb Z}_N^d: f(x) \not=0\}$. In this paper, we consider signals that are Dirac combs of complexity $\gamma$, meaning they have the form $f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{\gamma} a_i 1_{A_i}(x)$, where the sets $A_i \subset {\mathbb Z}_N^d$ are disjoint, $a_i$ are complex numbers, and $\gamma \leq N^d$. We will define the concept of effective support of these signals and show that if $\gamma$ is not too large, a good recovery condition can be obtained by pigeonholing under additional reasonable assumptions on the distribution of values. Our approach produces a non-trivial uncertainty principle and a signal recovery condition in many situations when the support of the function is too large to apply the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Paired-domination Problem on Circle and $k$-polygon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ is considered a dominating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V - D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. We called a dominating set $D$ as a paired-dominating set if the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we show that determining the minimum paired-dominating set on circle graphs is NP-complete. We further propose an $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-2k})$-time algorithm for $k$-polygon graphs, a subclass of circle graphs, for finding the minimum paired-dominating set. Moreover, we extend our method to improve the algorithm for finding the minimum dominating set on $k$-polygon graphs in~[\emph{E.S.~Elmallah and L.K.~Stewart, Independence and domination in polygon graphs, Discrete Appl. Math., 1993}] and reduce their time-complexity from $O(n^{4k^2+3})$ to $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-4k})$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithm for Paired-Domination in Distance-Hereditary Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domination problem and its variants represent a classical domain within algorithmic graph theory. Among these variants, the paired-domination problem holds particular prominence due to its real-world implications in security and surveillance domains. Given an input graph $G$, the paired-domination problem involves identifying a minimum dominating set $D$ that induces a subgraph of $G$ with a perfect matching. Lin et al.~[\emph{Paired-domination problem on distance-hereditary graphs}, Algorithmica, 2020] previously presented a solution to this problem with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$. This paper significantly enhances their findings by introducing an $O(n+m)$-time algorithm. Furthermore, the time complexity of this algorithm can be reduced to $O(n)$ when provided with a decomposition tree for the graph $G$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the normalising graph of a group and study the connectivity of the normalising and permuting graphs of a group when the group is finite and soluble. In particular, we classify finite soluble groups with disconnected normalising graph. The main results shows that if a finite soluble group has connected normalising graph then this graph has diameter at most 6. Furthermore, this bound is tight. A corollary then presents the connectivity properties of the permuting graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study and classify representations of a torsion group $G$ over an idempotent semifield with special attention on the case over the Boolean semifield $\mathbb{B}$. We also study tropical subrepresentations of the Boolean regular representation $\mathbb{B}[G]$ of a finite group $G$. These are equivalent to the matroids on ground set $G$ for which left-multiplication by each element of $G$ is a matroid automorphism. We completely classify the tropical subrepresentations of $\mathbb{B}[G]$ for rank 3. When $G$ is an abelian group, our approach can be seen as a generalization of Golomb rulers. In doing so, we also introduce an interesting class of matroids obtained from equivalence relations on finite sets.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference of a ranked community in a directed graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of detecting or recovering a planted ranked subgraph from a directed graph, an analog for directed graphs of the well-studied planted dense subgraph model. We suppose that, among a set of $n$ items, there is a subset $S$ of $k$ items having a latent ranking in the form of a permutation $\pi$ of $S$, and that we observe a fraction $p$ of pairwise orderings between elements of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ which agree with $\pi$ with probability $\frac{1}{2} + q$ between elements of $S$ and otherwise are uniformly random. Unlike in the planted dense subgraph and planted clique problems where the community $S$ is distinguished by its unusual density of edges, here the community is only distinguished by the unusual consistency of its pairwise orderings. We establish computational and statistical thresholds for both detecting and recovering such a ranked community. In the log-density setting where $k$, $p$, and $q$ all scale as powers of $n$, we establish the exact thresholds in the associated exponents at which detection and recovery become statistically and computationally feasible. These regimes include a rich variety of behaviors, exhibiting both statistical-computational and detection-recovery gaps. We also give finer-grained results for two extreme cases: (1) $p = 1$, $k = n$, and $q$ small, where a full tournament is observed that is weakly correlated with a global ranking, and (2) $p = 1$, $q = \frac{1}{2}$, and $k$ small, where a small "ordered clique" (totally ordered directed subgraph) is planted in a random tournament.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore several facets of tropical subrepresentations of a linear representation of a group over the tropical semifield $\mathbb{T}$. A key role in the study of tropical subrepresentations is played by two types of modules over a semiring: weakly free and quasi-free modules. We also investigate subgroups of $\text{GL}_n(K)$ for $K=\mathbb{T}$, $ \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, and automorphisms of weakly free modules and tropical prevarieties defined by tropical linear equations. As an application of our results, we provide an intrinsic description of tropical subrepresentation via certain quasi-free modules, and prove that a tropical subrepresentation is equivalent to a valuated matroidal representation.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We determine the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ in terms of certain maximal root subsystems described by Borel-de Siebenthal theory. We prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ is equidimensional, and we prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety. As a consequence, we find an affine paving of $\bar{\mathfrak h}$, and when $\mathfrak g$ is classical, we determine the number of strata in each dimension in terms of Stirling numbers and their variants, thereby computing the Betti numbers of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ In the general case, we relate the order relation on strata given by closures of strata to the poset of hyperplane arrangements studied by Orlik and Solomon, and determine the cup product in the cohomology of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ Our work has similarities to results of Braden et al \cite{BHMPW} on matroid Schubert varieties, but the connection to root systems facilitates greater precision in some of our results.</description>

      <title>From flip processes to dynamical systems on graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12272v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of random graph processes, which we call flip processes. Each such process is given by a rule which is a function $\mathcal{R}:\mathcal{H}_k\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_k$ from all labeled $k$-vertex graphs into itself ($k$ is fixed). The process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph $G_0$. In each step, the graph $G_i$ is obtained by sampling $k$ random vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of $G_{i-1}$ and replacing the induced graph $F:=G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]$ by $\mathcal{R}(F)$. This class contains several previously studied processes including the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph process and the triangle removal process. Actually, our definition of flip processes is more general, in that $\mathcal{R}(F)$ is a probability distribution on $\mathcal{H}_k$, thus allowing randomised replacements.
  Given a flip process with a rule $\mathcal{R}$, we construct time-indexed trajectories $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_0\times [0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathcal{W}_0$ in the space of graphons. We prove that for any $T &gt; 0$ starting with a large finite graph $G_0$ which is close to a graphon $W_0$ in the cut norm, with high probability the flip process will stay in a thin sausage around the trajectory $(\Phi(W_0,t))_{t=0}^T$ (after rescaling the time by the square of the order of the graph).
  These graphon trajectories are then studied from the perspective of dynamical systems. Among others topics, we study continuity properties of these trajectories with respect to time and initial graphon, existence and stability of fixed points and speed of convergence (whenever the infinite time limit exists). We give an example of a flip process with a periodic trajectory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by introducing new matrix operations and using a specific inverse relation, we establish the dual forms of the orthogonality relations for some well-known discrete and continuous $q$-orthogonal polynomials from the Askey-scheme such as the little and big $q$-Jacobi, $q$-Racah, (generalized) $q$-Laguerre, as well as the Askey-Wilson polynomials. As one of the most interesting results, we show that the Askey-Wilson $q$-beta integral represented in terms of the VWP-balanced $\,_8\phi_7$ series is just a dual form of the orthogonality relation of the Askey-Wilson polynomials.</description>

      <title>The dimension of the feasible region of pattern densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Erd\H{o}s, Lov\'asz and Spencer from the late 1970s asserts that the dimension of the feasible region of densities of graphs with at most k vertices in large graphs is equal to the number of non-trivial connected graphs with at most k vertices. Indecomposable permutations play the role of connected graphs in the realm of permutations, and Glebov et al. showed that pattern densities of indecomposable permutations are independent, i.e., the dimension of the feasible region of densities of permutation patterns of size at most k is at least the number of non-trivial indecomposable permutations of size at most k. However, this lower bound is not tight already for k=3. We prove that the dimension of the feasible region of densities of permutation patterns of size at most k is equal to the number of non-trivial Lyndon permutations of size at most k. The proof exploits an interplay between algebra and combinatorics inherent to the study of Lyndon words.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for graphically divergent series: dense digraphs and 2-SAT formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for obtaining complete asymptotic expansions in a systematic manner, which is suitable for counting sequences of various graph families in dense regime. The core idea is to encode the two-dimensional array of expansion coefficients into a special bivariate generating function, which we call a coefficient generating function. We show that coefficient generating functions possess certain general properties that make it possible to express asymptotics in a short closed form. Also, in most scenarios, we indicate a combinatorial meaning of the involved coefficients. Applications of our method include asymptotics of connected graphs, irreducible tournaments, strongly connected digraphs, 2-SAT formulae and contradictory strongly connected implication digraphs. Moreover, due to its flexibility, the method allows to treat a wide range of structural variations, including fixing the numbers of connected, irreducible, strongly connected and contradictory components, as well as source-like, sink-like and isolated ones, or adding weights and marking variables.</description>

      <title>On the maximum number of common neighbours in dense random regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the distribution of the maximum number of common neighbours of a pair of vertices in a dense random regular graph.The proof involves two important steps. One step is to establish the extremal independence property: the asymptotic equivalence with the maximum component of a vector with independent marginal distributions. The other step is to prove that the distribution of the number of common neighbours for each pair of vertices can be approximated by the binomial distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of P-polynomial coherent configurations and show that they can have at most two fibres. We then introduce a class of two-fibre coherent configurations which have two distinguished bases for the coherent algebra, similar to the Bose-Mesner algebra of an association scheme. Examples of these bipartite coherent configurations include the P-polynomial class of distance-biregular graphs, as well as quasi-symmetric designs and strongly regular designs.</description>

      <title>Two Erdos-Hajnal-type theorems for forbidden order-size pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture says that any graph without a fixed induced subgraph $H$ contains a very large homogeneous set. A direct analog of this conjecture is not true for hypergraphs. In this paper we present two natural variants of this problem which do hold for hypergraphs. We show that for every $r \geq 3$, $m \geq m_0(r)$ and $0 \leq f \leq \binom{m}{r}$, if an $r$-graph $G$ does not contain $m$ vertices spanning exactly $f$ edges, then $G$ contains much bigger homogeneous sets than what is guaranteed to exist in general $r$-graphs. We also prove that if a $3$-graph $G$ does not contain homogeneous sets of polynomial size, then for every $m \geq 3$ there are $\Omega(m^3)$ values of $f$ such that $G$ contains $m$ vertices spanning exactly $f$ edges. This makes progress on a problem of Axenovich, Brada\v{c}, Gishboliner, Mubayi and Weber.</description>

      <title>On The Application Of State Sum Decomposition method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the state sum decomposition method to derive a closed formula for the enumeration of lozenge tilings of the region constructed out of a regular hexagon by removing the "maximal staircase" from its alternating corners. This problem, originally proposed by Ciucu and Krattenthaler (2002), has remained unsolved. We introduce the concept of "$Fibonacci-Coloring$" for planar graphs and derive a summation formula of the enumeration in terms of powers of $2$. This formula is reminiscent of the celebrated Aztec Diamond Theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp (1992), which concerns domino tilings of Aztec Diamonds.</description>

Abstract: We provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Chow polynomial and for the augmented Chow polynomial of uniform matroids, thereby proving a conjecture by Ferroni. These formulas refine existing formulas by Hampe and by Eur, Huh, and Larson, offering a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients based on Schubert matroids. As a byproduct, we count Schubert matroids by rank, number of loops, and cogirth.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with full difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of a finite set, define $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\{F\setminus F': F, F'\in\mathcal{F}\}$. A family $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\not=\emptyset$ for all $F, F'\in\mathcal{F}$. Frankl \cite{Frankl} showed that for a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ with $n\ge k(k+3)$, $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ reaches the maximum if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $k$-uniform full star. Later, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} improved the bound $n\ge k(k+3)$ in the above result of Frankl \cite{Frankl} to $n\ge 50klnk$ for $k\ge 50$. For $2k&lt;n&lt;4k$, Frankl-Kiselev-Kupavskii \cite{FKK} showed that there exists a $k$-uniform family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ such that $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})|$ is larger than $|\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})|$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a full star. This result left the case $n=2k$ open and we show that $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})$ can be `full' for some $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$. It is clear that for an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$, $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})\subseteq \cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. We say that a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ has full differences if $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{F})=\cup_{j=0}^{k-1}{[n]\choose j}$. For odd $k$, Frankl \cite{Frankl} gave a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$, and he asked for even $k\ge 4$ whether there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences of size $k-1$. We answer this question in a stronger form and show that for even $k\ge 4$, there exists a $k$-uniform intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[2k]\choose k}$ having full differences.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a simplified proof of Rado's Theorem and demonstrate that when an integer matrix $M$ satisfies the column condition and $M\mathbf x=\mathbf 0$ has an element-distinct solution on $\mathbb N$, then under any finite coloring of $\mathbb N$, the equation $M\mathbf x=\mathbf 0$ has a monochromatic element-distinct solution. This gives a positive answer to a problem of Di Nasso in 2016.</description>

      <title>On Rank-Monotone Graph Operations and Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$, with a particular focus on finding and characterizing the smallest graphs with a given $\text{LS}_+$-rank (the needed number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We introduce a generalized vertex-stretching operation that appears to be promising in generating $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs and study its properties. We also provide several new $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs, most notably the first known instances of $12$-vertex graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $4$, which provides the first advance in this direction since Escalante, Montelar, and Nasini's discovery of a $9$-vertex graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $3$ in 2006.</description>

      <title>O(1) Insertion for Random Walk d-ary Cuckoo Hashing up to the Load Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every $d\ge 3$ hashes, let $c_d^*$ be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of $cm$ objects to a hash table of size $m$ likely exists. We show that for any $d\ge 4$ hashes and load factor $c&lt;c_d^*$, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is $O(1)$, that is, a constant depending only on $d$ and $c$ but not $m$.</description>

      <title>Bernstein--Sato polynomials of locally quasi-homogeneous divisors in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a locally quasi-homogeneous polynomial $f \in R = \mathbb{C}[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}]$. We construct, in the analytic category, a complex of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-modules that can be used to compute the $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-dual of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s] f^{s-1}$ as the middle term of a short exact sequence where the outer terms are well understood. This extends a result by Narv\'{a}ez Macarro where a freeness assumption was required.
  We derive many results about the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. First, we prove each nonvanishing degree of the zeroeth local cohomology of the Milnor algebra $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0} (R / (\partial f))$ contributes a root to the Bernstein--Sato polynomial, generalizing a result of M. Saito's (where the argument cannot weaken homogeneity to quasi-homogeneity). Second, we prove the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial admit a partial symmetry about $-1$, extending a result of Narv\'{a}ez Macarro that again required freeness. We give applications to very small roots, the twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, and more precise statements when $f$ is additionally assumed to be homogeneous.
  Finally, when $f$ defines a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ we give a complete formula for the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$. We show all zeroes except the candidate root $-2 + (2 / \text{deg}(f))$ are (easily) combinatorially given; we give many equivalent characterizations of when the only non-combinatorial candidate root $-2 + (2/ \text{deg}(f))$ is in fact a zero of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. One equivalent condition is the nonvanishing of $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0}( R / (\partial f))_{\text{deg}(f) - 1}$.</description>
