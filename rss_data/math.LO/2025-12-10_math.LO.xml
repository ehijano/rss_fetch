      <title>Shelah Ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a special type of ultrafilter which we call Shelah ultrafilter. We show that it is possible to add a Shelah ultrafilter using a special forcing notion. We also show that Shelah ultrafilters turn out to be I-ultrafilters for many Borel ideals.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Fields of dp-Rank 2 and their W_2-Topologies: The Characteristic 2 Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we reproduce Johnson's analysis of $W_2$-topologies on fields of characteristic 2, which was originally stated for fields of characteristic different than 2. Following his framework, we prove that the canonical topology of an unstable field of characteristic 2 and dp-rank 2 is a $V$-topology. Additionally, we show that any $W_2$-topology on a field of characteristic 2 is either induced by the intersection of two valuation rings or it is induced by dense pre-diffeo-valuation data, completing the picture for all positive characteristic fields.</description>

      <title>Higher walks and squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the development of the theory of higher dimensional walks on ordinals began recently by Bergfalk. In particular we identify natural coherence conditions on higher dimensional $C$-sequences that entail coherence of the resultant higher rho-functions. We also introduce various higher square principles by adding non-triviality conditions to these coherent higher $C$-sequences and investigate basic properties of said square principles. For example, in analogy with the classical case, we prove that these higher square principles abound in the constructible universe but can be forced to fail, modulo large cardinals. Finally, we prove that certain higher rho-functions obtained by walking along higher square sequences exhibit non-triviality in addition to coherence. In particular, it follows that higher square principles on a cardinal $\lambda$ entail certain non-vanishing \v{C}ech cohomology groups for $\lambda$ considered with the order topology.</description>

      <title>On semantics of first-order justification logic with binding modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first order logic of proofs $FOLP^\Box$ in the joint language combining justification terms and binding modalities. The main issue is Kripke--style semantics for this logic. We describe models for $FOLP^\Box$ in terms of valuations of individual variables instead of introducing constants to the language. This approach requires a new format of the evidence function. This allows us to assign semantic meaning to formulas that contain free variables. The main results are soundness and completeness of $FOLP^\Box$ with respect to the described semantics.</description>

      <title>L-algebras and their ideals: from simplicity to semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ideals of semidirect products of L-algebras and the structure of simple L-algebras. We provide a precise characterization of the ideals of semidirect products and describe the structure of their prime spectrum. Furthermore, we introduce a family of finite simple L-algebras and prove that every simple linear L-algebra belongs to this family. We also show that the family we construct coincides with the class of simple algebras in a certain subclass of finite CKL-algebras. As an application, we use these results to give a clear description of linear Hilbert algebras and their symmetric semidirect products.</description>

      <title>Saturation Properties of Ultrafilters in Canonical Inner Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve Galvin's Theorem for ultrafilters which are p-point limits of p-points. This implies that in all the canonical inner models up to a superstrong cardinal, every $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter over a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ satisfies the Galvin property. On the other hand, we prove that supercompact cardinals always carry non-Galvin $\kappa$-complete ultrafilters. Finally, we prove that $\diamondsuit(\kappa)$ implies the existence of a $\kappa$-complete filter which extends the club filter and fails to satisfy the Galvin property. This answers questions \cite[Question 5.22]{TomMotiII},\cite[Question 3.4]{Non-GalvinFil} and questions ,\cite[Question 4.5]{BenGarShe},\cite[Question 2.26]{bgp}.</description>

      <title>A Small Ultrafilter Number at Every Singular Cardinal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a small ultrafilter number at $\aleph_{\omega_1}$. Moreover, we develop a version of the overlapping strong extender forcing with collapses which can keep the top cardinal $\kappa$ inaccessible. We apply this forcing to construct a model where $\kappa$ is the least inaccessible and $V_\kappa$ is a model of GCH at regulars, failures of SCH at singulars, and the ultrafilter numbers at all singulars are small.</description>

      <title>The Galvin property under the Ultrapower Axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the Galvin property from \cite{bgs} and \cite{Benhamou2}. In particular, we deepen the connection between certain diamond-like principles and non-Galvin ultrafilters. We also show that any Dodd sound non p-point ultrafilter is non-Galvin. We use these ideas to formulate what appears to be the optimal large cardinal hypothesis implying the existence of a non-Galvin ultrafilter, improving on a result from \cite{Benhamou_Dobrinen}. Finally, we use a strengthening of the Ultrapower Axiom to prove that in all the known canonical inner models, a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter has the Galvin property if and only if it is an iterated sum of $p$-points.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of Cofinal Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the pseudo-intersection property with respect to an ideal introduced in \cite{TomNatasha2}. Our theory applies to the study of the Tukey types of general sums of ultrafilters, which, as evidenced by the results of this paper, can be quite complex. It also applies to construct a large class of ultrafilter $\mathcal{C}$ over $\omega$ such that any two ultrafilters $U,V\in \mathcal{C}$ commute; that is, $U\cdot V\equiv_T V\cdot U$. The class $\mathcal{C}$ class contains most known cofinal types of ultrafilters on $\omega$. This is in sharp contrast to the Rudin-Keisler ordering. In the third part of this paper, we apply our results to study the class of ultrafilters Tukey above $\omega^\omega$. Specifically, we prove that ultrafilters without the $I$-p.i.p are always above $I^\omega$ and in particular non-$p$-points are Tukey above $\omega^\omega$. Finally, we introduce the hierarchy of $\alpha$-almost rapid ultrafilters. We prove that it is consistent for them to form a strictly wider class than the rapid ultrafilters, and give an example of a non-rapid $p$-point ultrafilter which is Tukey above $\omega^\omega$. This addresses and answers several questions from \cite{TomNatasha,TomNatasha2,Dobrinen/Todorcevic11,Milovich08}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize sums of normal ultrafilters after the Magidor iteration (product) of Prikry forcings over a discrete set of measurable cardinals. We apply this to show that the weak Ultrapower Axiom is not equivalent to the Ultrapower Axiom. We also construct a non-rigid ultrapower and two uniform ultrafilters on different cardinals that have the same ultrapower.</description>

      <title>Measures that violate the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple \(P_\lambda\)-point on a regular cardinal \(\kappa\) is a uniform ultrafilter on \(\kappa\) with a mod-bounded decreasing generating sequence of length \(\lambda\).
  We prove that if there is a simple $P_\lambda$-point ultrafilter over $\kappa&gt;\omega$, then $\lambda=\mathfrak{d}_\kappa=\mathfrak{b}_\kappa=\mathfrak{u}_\kappa=\mathfrak{r}_\kappa=\mathfrak{s}_\kappa$. We show that such ultrafilters appear in the models of \cite{SimonOmer,BROOKETAYLOR201737}. We improve the lower bound for the consistency strength of the existence of a $P_{\kappa^{++}}$-point to a $2$-strong cardinal. Finally, we apply our arguments to obtain non-trivial lower bounds for (1) the statement that the generalized tower number $\mathfrak{t}_\kappa$ is greater than $\kappa^+$ and $\kappa$ is measurable, (2) the preservation of measurability after the generalized Mathias forcing, and (3) variations of filter games of \cite{NIELSEN_WELCH_2019,HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals,MagForZem} in the case $2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+$.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>Almost disjoint families and some automorphic and injective properties of $\ell_\infty/c_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering questions of A. Avil\'es, F. Cabello S\'anchez, J. Castillo, M. Gonz\'alez and Y. Moreno we show that the following statements are independent of the usual axioms ZFC with arbitrarily large continuum: for every (some) $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$
  (1) any linear bounded operator $T: c_0(\kappa)\rightarrow\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to any superspace of $c_0(\kappa)$.
  (2) any isomorphism between any two copies of $c_0(\kappa)$ inside $\ell_\infty/c_0$ extends to an automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$.
  This contrasts with Boolean, Banach algebraic or isometric levels, where the objects known as Hausdorff gap and Luzin gap witness the failure in ZFC of the corresponding properties for the corresponding structures already at the first uncountable cardinal $\kappa=\omega_1$. In particular, consistently, any two pairwise disjoint families in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$ of the same cardinality $\omega&lt;\kappa&lt;2^\omega$ can be mapped onto each other by a linear automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$ regardless of their different combinatorial, algebraic or topological positions in $\wp(\mathbb N)/Fin$.
  Our positive consistency results use a restricted version of Martin's axiom for a partial order that adds an infinite block diagonal matrix of an operator on $\ell_\infty$ which induces an operator on $\ell_\infty/c_0$. The construction of its finite blocks relies on a lemma of Bourgain and Tzafriri on finite dimensional Banach spaces.
  Our negative consistency results rely on an analysis of almost disjoint families of $\mathbb N$, the embeddings of $c_0(\kappa)$ into $\ell_\infty/c_0$ they induce and their extensions to $\ell_\infty^c(\kappa)$.</description>
