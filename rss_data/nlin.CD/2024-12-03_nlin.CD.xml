      <title>Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariant measures are widely used to compare chaotic dynamical systems, as they offer robustness to noisy data, uncertain initial conditions, and irregular sampling. However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables. Our findings improve the effectiveness of invariant measures in system identification and broaden the scope of measure-theoretic approaches to modeling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coevolution on social models couples the time evolution of the network with the time evolution of the states of the agents. This paper presents a new coevolution dynamic allowing more than one rewiring on the network. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for problem-solving capability of task-forces. We used an agent-based model study how this new coevolution dynamic can help a group of agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Each agent can replace more than one neighbors, and this quantity is a tunable parameter in the model. These rewirings is a way for the agent to obtain information from individuals that were not previously part of its neighborhood. Our results showed that this tunable coevolution can indeed produce gain on the computational cost under certain circunstances. At low average degree (using a random network to connect the agents) and on easy landscape, more rewirings return lower cost, helping the agents to find the global maximum faster. However, at larger average degree and difficult landscape, the effect is more complex. At medium size systems, the coevolution brings optimal results when 3 or 4 neighbors are replaced.</description>

      <title>Recurrences reveal shared causal drivers of complex time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmeasured causal forces influence diverse experimental time series, such as the transcription factors that regulate genes, or the descending neurons that steer motor circuits. Combining the theory of skew-product dynamical systems with topological data analysis, we show that simultaneous recurrence events across multiple time series reveal the structure of their shared unobserved driving signal. We introduce a physics-based unsupervised learning algorithm that reconstructs causal drivers by iteratively building a recurrence graph with glass-like structure. As the amount of data increases, a percolation transition on this graph leads to weak ergodicity breaking for random walks -- revealing the shared driver's dynamics, even from strongly-corrupted measurements. We relate reconstruction accuracy to the rate of information transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver's dynamical attractor. Through extensive benchmarks against classical signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate our method's ability to extract causal drivers from diverse experimental datasets spanning ecology, genomics, fluid dynamics, and physiology.</description>
