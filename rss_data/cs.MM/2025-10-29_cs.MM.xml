      <title>Model-Guided Dual-Role Alignment for High-Fidelity Open-Domain Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MGAudio, a novel flow-based framework for open-domain video-to-audio generation, which introduces model-guided dual-role alignment as a central design principle. Unlike prior approaches that rely on classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and (3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100 benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation.

      <title>BLM$_1$: A Boundless Large Model for Cross-Space, Cross-Task, and Cross-Embodiment Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive 3D Mesh Steganography Based on Feature-Preserving Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current 3D mesh steganography algorithms relying on geometric modification are prone to detection by steganalyzers. In traditional steganography, adaptive steganography has proven to be an efficient means of enhancing steganography security. Taking inspiration from this, we propose a highly adaptive embedding algorithm, guided by the principle of minimizing a carefully crafted distortion through efficient steganography codes. Specifically, we tailor a payload-limited embedding optimization problem for 3D settings and devise a feature-preserving distortion (FPD) to measure the impact of message embedding. The distortion takes on an additive form and is defined as a weighted difference of the effective steganalytic subfeatures utilized by the current 3D steganalyzers. With practicality in mind, we refine the distortion to enhance robustness and computational efficiency. By minimizing the FPD, our algorithm can preserve mesh features to a considerable extent, including steganalytic and geometric features, while achieving a high embedding capacity. During the practical embedding phase, we employ the Q-layered syndrome trellis code (STC). However, calculating the bit modification probability (BMP) for each layer of the Q-layered STC, given the variation of Q, can be cumbersome. To address this issue, we design a universal and automatic approach for the BMP calculation. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in countering 3D steganalysis. Code is available at https://github.com/zjhJOJO/3D-steganography-based-on-FPD.git.</description>

      <title>Mano Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.</description>

      <title>Does CLIP perceive art the same way we do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05229</link>

Abstract: CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it 'see' the same way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations, particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance and subjectivity play a central role.</description>
