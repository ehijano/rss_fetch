      <title>Irrationality of the general smooth quartic $3$-fold using intermediate Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the intermediate Jacobian of the Klein quartic $3$-fold $X$ is not isomorphic, as a principally polarized abelian variety, to a product of Jacobians of curves. As corollaries we deduce (using a criterion of Clemens-Griffiths) that $X$, as well as the general smooth quartic $3$-fold, is irrational. These corollaries were known: Iskovskih-Manin \cite{IM} proved that every smooth quartic $3$-fold is irrational. However, the method of proof here is different than that of \cite{IM} and is significantly simpler.</description>

      <title>Computation of Weight 11 Compactly Supported Cohomology of Moduli Spaces of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their homonymous article, Sam Payne and Thomas Willwacher construct a combinatorial graph complex to compute the weight 11 part of the compactly supported cohomology of the moduli space of curves $\cM_{g,n}$ and compute explicitly the cohomology of the introduced graph complexes in cases of complexes of excess zero, one, two, and three. In this paper, we extend the computation the cohomology to excess four graph complexes. Along the way, we give more details on generators, the computation process, and the definition of the graph complex.</description>

      <title>The characteristic cycle of a non-confluent $\ell$-adic GKZ hypergeometric sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\ell$-adic GKZ hypergeometric sheaf is defined analogously to a GKZ hypergeometric $\mathcal{D}$-module. We introduce an algorithm of computing the characteristic cycle of an $\ell$-adic GKZ hypergeometric sheaf of certain type. Our strategy is to apply a formula of the characteristic cycle of the direct image of an $\ell$-adic sheaf. We verify the requirements for the formula to hold by calculating the dimension of the direct image of a certain closed conical subset of cotangent bundle. We also define an $\ell$-adic GKZ-type sheaf whose specialization tensored with a constant sheaf is isomorphic to an $\ell$-adic non-confluent GKZ hypergeometric sheaf. On the other hand, the topological model of an $\ell$-adic GKZ-type sheaf is isomorphic to the image by the de Rham functor of a non-confluent GKZ hypergeometric $\mathcal{D}$-module whose characteristic cycle has been calculated. This gives an easier way to determine the characteristic cycle of an $\ell$-adic non-confluent GKZ hypergeometric sheaf of certain type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a ternary homogeneous polynomial, the fixed points of the map from $\mathbb{P}^2$ to itself defined by its gradient are called its eigenpoints. We focus on cubic polynomials, and analyze configurations of eigenpoints that admit one or more alignments. We give a classification and explicit equations, in the coordinates of the points, of all configurations: this is accomplished by using both geometric techniques and by an extensive use of computer algebra.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Mond conjecture for wave fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Mond conjecture for wave fronts which states that the number of parameters of a frontal versal unfolding is less than or equal to the number of spheres in the image of a stable frontal deformation with equality if the wave front is weighted homogeneous. We give two different proofs. The first one depends on the fact that wave fronts are related to discriminants of map germs and we then use the analogous result proved by Damon and Mond in this context. The second one is based on ideas by Fern\'andez de Bobadilla, Nu\~no-Ballesteros and Pe\~nafort Sanchis and by Nu\~no-Ballesteros and Fern\'andez-Hern\'andez. The advantage of the second approach is that most results are valid for any frontal, not only wave fronts, and thus give important tools which may be useful to prove the conjecture for frontals in general.</description>

      <title>On the local cohomology of secant varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sufficiently positive embedding $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ of a smooth projective variety $X$, we consider its secant variety $\Sigma$ that comes equipped with the embedding $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ by its construction. In this article, we determine the local cohomological dimension $\textrm{lcd}(\mathbb{P}^N,\Sigma)$ of this embedding, as well as the generation level of the Hodge filtration on the topmost non-vanishing local cohomology module $\mathcal{H}^{q}_{\Sigma}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^N})$, i.e., when $q=\textrm{lcd}(\mathbb{P}^N,\Sigma)$. Additionally, we show that $\Sigma$ has quotient singularities (in which case the equality $\textrm{lcd}(\mathbb{P}^N,\Sigma)=\textrm{codim}_{\mathbb{P}^N}(\Sigma)$ is known to hold) if and only if $X\cong\mathbb{P}^1$. We also provide a complete classification of $(X,L)$ for which $\Sigma$ has ($\mathbb{Q}$-)Gorentein singularities. As a consequence, we deduce that if $\Sigma$ is a local complete intersection, then either $X$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$, or an elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Types Of Toric Orbifolds From Weyl Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a reduced crystallographic root system with a fixed simple system, it is associated to a Weyl group $W$, parabolic subgroups $W_K$'s and a polytope $P$ which is the convex hull of a dominant weight. The quotient $P/W_K$ can be identified with a polytope. Polytopes $P$ and $P/W_K$ are associated to toric varieties $X_P$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ respectively. It turns out the underlying topological spaces $X_P/W_K$ and $X_{P/W_K}$ are homotopy equivalent, when considering the polytopes in the real span of the root lattice or of the weight lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between torsion tensors of principal connections on G-structures and characteristic conic connections on associated cone structures. We formulate sufficient conditions under which the existence of a characteristic conic connection implies the existence of a torsion-free principal connection. We verify these conditions for adjoint varieties of simple Lie algebras, excluding those of type $\textsf{A}_{\ell \neq 2}$ or $\textsf{C}_{\ell}$. As an application, we give a complete classification of the germs of minimal rational curves whose VMRT at a general point is such an adjoint variety: nontrivial ones come from lines on hyperplane sections of certain Grassmannians or minimal rational curves on wonderful group compactifications.</description>

      <title>Dwork Motives, Monodromy and Potential Automorphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study certain families of motives, which arise as direct summands of the cohomology of the Dwork family. We computationally find examples of interesting families with the following three properties. Firstly, their geometric monodromy group is Zariski dense in $\operatorname{SL}_n$. Secondly, they realise many different unipotent operators as the monodromy operator at $t = \infty$. Thirdly, all their Hodge numbers are $\leq 1$.
  This has consequences for Galois representations. Namely, if a nilpotent operator $N$ appears as the monodromy at $t = \infty$ in one of our families, we can construct potentially automorphic representations with $\ell$-adic monodromy given by $N$ at a fixed prime $p$. As another application, we obtain a new proof of some cases of the recent local-global compatibility theorem of Matsumoto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Fano scheme $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{X})$ of lines on a cubic $\mathrm{X}$ of dimension $d$ with only finitely many singularities. By taking the relative Fano scheme, we define a morphism $\eta:\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{X}}\rightarrow\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{F}}$ of the local moduli functors associated to $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{F}$, respectively. We show that for $d\geqslant 5$, $\eta$ yields an isomorphism on first-order deformations; in particular, $\eta$ is an isomorphism whenever $\mathrm{H}^{0}(\Theta_{\mathrm{X}})=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards building tropical analogues of adic spaces, we study certain spaces of prime congruences as a topological semiring replacement for the space of continuous valuations on a topological ring. This requires building the theory of topological idempotent semirings, and we consider semirings of convergent power series as a primary example. We consider the semiring of convergent power series as a topological space by defining a metric on it. We check that, in tropical toric cases, the proposed objects carry meaningful geometric information. In particular, we show that the dimension behaves as expected. We give an explicit characterization of the points in terms of classical polyhedral geometry in a follow up paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between fibrations arising naturally from a surjective morphism to an abelian variety. These fibrations encode geometric information about the morphism. Our study focuses on the interplay of these fibrations and presents several applications. Then we propose a generalization of the Iitaka conjecture which predicts an equality of Kodaira dimension of fibrations, and prove it when the base is a smooth projective variety of maximal Albanese dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R=K[x,y,z]$. A reduced plane curve $C=V(f)\subset \mathbf P^2$ is $free \ $ if its associated module of tangent derivations $\mathrm{Der}(f)$ is a free $R$-module, or equivalently if the corresponding sheaf $T_ {\mathbf P^2 }(-\log C)$ of vector fields tangent to $C$ splits as a direct sum of line bundles on $\mathbf P^2$. In general, free curves are difficult to find, and in this note, we describe a new method for constructing free curves in $\mathbf P^2$. The key tools in our approach are eigenschemes and pencils of curves, combined with an interpretation of Saito's criterion in this context. Previous constructions typically applied only to curves with quasihomogeneous singularities, which is not necessary in our approach. We illustrate our method by constructing large families of free curves.</description>

      <title>Structure of connected nested automorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nested group is an increasing union of algebraic groups. It is well known that any algebraic subgroup of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ of an affine variety $X$ is closed with respect to the ind-topology. The closedness of connected nested subgroups in $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ is an open question (Kraft--Zaidenberg'2022, arXiv:2203.11356).
  In this paper, we describe maximal nested unipotent subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ by generalizing the one of triangular automorphisms of $\mathbb{A}^n$. We show that if an abstract subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ consists of unipotent elements, then it is closed if and only if it is nested. This implies that a connected nested subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ is closed.
  We also extend the recent description of maximal commutative unipotent subgroups (Regeta--van Santen'2024, arXiv:2112.04784), offering a direct construction method and relating them to our description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a bigraded cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on the weight zero compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. By relating the primitives for the coproduct to graph cohomology, we deduce that $\dim H^{2g+k}_c(\mathcal{A}_g)$ grows at least exponentially with $g$ for $k = 0$ and for all but finitely many positive integers $k$. Our proof relies on a new result of independent interest; we use a filtered variant of the Waldhausen construction to show that Quillen's spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of $BK(\mathbb{Z})$ is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. From the same construction, we also deduce that $\dim H^{\binom{n}{2} - n - k}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}))$ grows at least exponentially with $n$, for $k = -1$ and for all but finitely many non-negative integers $k$.</description>

Abstract: We study a set of topological roots of the local Bernstein-Sato polynomial of arbitrary plane curve singularities. These roots are characterized in terms of certain divisorial valuations and the numerical data of the minimal log resolution. In particular, this set of roots strictly contains both the opposites of the jumping numbers in $(0, 1)$ and the poles of the motivic zeta function counted with multiplicity. As a consequence, we prove the multiplicity part of the Strong Monodromy Conjecture for $n = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the minimal plus-one generated curves and prove a result explaining why they are the closest relatives of the free curves, after the nearly free curves. Then we look at the projective closures of the general and of the special fibers of some Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials constructed by E. Artal Bartolo, Pi. Cassou-Nogu\`es and I. Luengo Velasco. They yield new examples of free, nearly free or minimal plus-one generated curves. In the final section we give a characterization of plus-one generated curves in terms of eigenscheme ideals, similar to the characterization of free curves given by R. Di Gennaro, G. Ilardi, R.M.

      <title>Section conjectures over $\mathbb{C}$ and Kodaira fibrations</title>

Abstract: In this paper we propose and study topological and Hodge theoretic analogues of Grothendieck's section conjecture over the complex numbers. We study these questions in the context of family of curves, in particular Kodaira fibrations, and in the context of the family of Jacobians associated to a Kodaira fibration. We showed that in the case of family of curves, both the topological and Hodge-theoretic analogues of the injectivity part of the section conjecture holds, and that in the case of family of Jacobians, the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture does not hold in general. For family of curves, we also reduce the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture to the case where the families have no algebraic sections.</description>

      <title>Hecke operators on topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cohomology theory TMF of topological modular forms is a derived algebro-geometric interpretation of the classical ring of complex modular forms from number theory. In this article, we refine the classical Adams operations, Hecke operators, and Atkin--Lehner involutions from endomorphisms of classical modular forms to stable operators on TMF. Our algebro-geometric formulation of these operators leads to simple proofs of their many remarkable properties and computations. From these properties, we use techniques from homotopy theory to make simple number-theoretic deductions, including a rederivation of some classical congruences of Ramanujan and providing new infinite families of classical Hecke operators which satisfy Maeda's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Towards studying the structure of triple Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Going beyond the studies of single and double Hurwitz numbers, we report some progress towards studying Hurwitz numbers which correspond to ramified coverings of the Riemann sphere involving three nonsimple branch points. We first prove a recursion which implies a fundamental identity of Frobenius enumerating factorizations of a permutation in group algebra theory. We next apply the recursion to study Hurwitz numbers involving three nonsimple branch points (besides simple ones),two of them having deterministic ramification profiles while the remaining one having a prescribed number of preimages. The recursion allows us to obtain recurrences as well as explicit formulas for these numbers which also generalize a number of existing results on single and double Hurwitz numbers. The case where one of the nonsimple branch points with deterministic profile has a unique preimage (one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers {or $(1,m)$-part triple Hurwitz numbers}) is particularly studied in detail. We prove an attractive dimension-reduction formula from which any one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz number can be reduced to quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers where both with deterministic profiles are fully ramified. We also obtain the polynomiality of one-part quasi-triple Hurwitz numbers analogous to that implied by the remarkable ELSV formula for single Hurwitz numbers, and discuss the potential connection to intersection theory.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Schubert calculus and geometric Satake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main classical result of Schubert calculus is that multiplication rules for the basis of Schubert cycles inside the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian $G(n,m)$ are the same as multiplication rules for the basis of Schur polynomials in the ring of symmetric polynomials. In this paper, we explain how to recover this somewhat mysterious connection by using the geometric Satake correspondence to put the structure of a representation of $GL_m$ on $H^\bullet(G(n,m))$ and comparing it to the Fock space representation on symmetric polynomials. This proof also extends to equivariant Schubert calculus, and gives an explanation of the relationship between torus-equivariant cohomology of Grassmannians and double Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of holomorphic mappings into or avoiding Fermat type hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $f\colon\mathbb{C}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C})$ is a holomorphic mapping of maximal rank whose image lies in the Fermat hypersurface of degree $d&gt;(n+1)\max\{n-p,1\}$, then its image is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\bigg[\dfrac{n-1}{2}\bigg]$. Analog in the logarithmic case is also given. Our result strengthens a classical result of Green and provides a Nevanlinna theoretic proof for a recent result due to Etesse.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability. It does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>
