      <title>On Substochastic Inverse Eigenvalue Problems with the Corresponding Eigenvector Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse eigenvalue problem of constructing a substochastic matrix from the given spectrum parameters with the corresponding eigenvector constraints. This substochastic inverse eigenvalue problem (SstIEP) with the specific eigenvector constraints is formulated into a nonconvex optimization problem (NcOP). The solvability for SstIEP with the specific eigenvector constraints is equivalent to identify the attainability of a zero optimal value for the formulated NcOP. When the optimal objective value is zero, the corresponding optimal solution to the formulated NcOP is just the substochastic matrix desired to be constructed. We develop the alternating minimization algorithm to solve the formulated NcOP, and its convergence is established by developing a novel method to obtain the boundedness of the optimal solution. Some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis and optimal control of the logistic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the unexploited/exploited logistic equation and study the stability of equilibrium points through Lyapunov functions. Then, we apply first and second order optimality conditions for the optimal control of the total biomass yield. Finally, we note that the time-scale logistic equation present in the literature lacks biological significance and we propose a new version of a dynamic logistic equation, valid on an arbitrary time scale, for which any trajectory of the system, beginning with a positive initial condition, remains nonnegative.</description>

      <title>KKT-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural network-based approach for solving parametric convex optimization problems is presented, where the network estimates the optimal points given a batch of input parameters. The network is trained by penalizing violations of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, ensuring that its predictions adhere to these optimality criteria. Additionally, since the bounds of the parameter space are known, training batches can be randomly generated without requiring external data. This method trades guaranteed optimality for significant improvements in speed, enabling parallel solving of a class of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of opinion dynamics with complex interaction types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence rate is a crucial issue in opinion dynamics, which characterizes how quickly opinions reach a consensus and tells when the collective behavior can be formed. However, the key factors that determine the convergence rate of opinions are elusive, especially when individuals interact with complex interaction types such as friend/foe, ally/adversary, or trust/mistrust. In this paper, using random matrix theory and low-rank perturbation theory, we present a new body of theory to comprehensively study the convergence rate of opinion dynamics. First, we divide the complex interaction types into five typical scenarios: mutual trust $(+/+)$, mutual mistrust $(-/-)$, trust$/$mistrust $(+/-)$, unilateral trust $(+/0)$, and unilateral mistrust $(-/0)$. For diverse interaction types, we derive the mathematical expression of the convergence rate, and further establish the direct connection between the convergence rate and population size, the density of interactions (network connectivity), and individuals' self-confidence level. Second, taking advantage of these connections, we prove that for the $(+/+)$, $(+/-)$, $(+/0)$, and random mixture of different interaction types, the convergence rate is proportional to the population size and network connectivity, while it is inversely proportional to the individuals' self-confidence level. However, for the $(-/-)$ and $(-/0)$ scenarios, we draw the exact opposite conclusions. Third, for the $(+/+,-/-)$ and $(-/-,-/0)$ scenarios, we derive the optimal proportion of different interaction types to ensure the fast convergence of opinions. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>New Heuristics for the Operation of an Ambulance Fleet under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of an ambulance fleet involves ambulance selection decisions about which ambulance to dispatch to each emergency, and ambulance reassignment decisions about what each ambulance should do after it has finished the service associated with an emergency. For ambulance selection decisions, we propose four new heuristics: the Best Myopic (BM) heuristic, a NonMyopic (NM) heuristic, and two greedy heuristics (GHP1 and GHP2). Two variants of the greedy heuristics are also considered. We also propose an optimization problem for an extension of the BM heuristic, useful when a call for several patients arrives. For ambulance reassignment decisions, we propose several strategies to choose which emergency in queue to send an ambulance to or which ambulance station to send an ambulance to when it finishes service. These heuristics are also used in a rollout approach: each time a new decision has to be made (when a call arrives or when an ambulance finishes service), a two-stage stochastic program is solved. The proposed heuristics are used to efficiently compute the second stage cost of these problems. We apply the rollout approach with our heuristics to data of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) of a large city, and show that these methods outperform other heuristics that have been proposed for ambulance dispatch decisions. We also show that better response times can be obtained using the rollout approach instead of using the heuristics without rollout. Moreover, each decision is computed in a few seconds, which allows these methods to be used for the real-time management of a fleet of ambulances.</description>

      <title>A Unified Funnel Restoration SQP Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinearly constrained optimization problems and discuss a generic double-loop framework consisting of four algorithmic ingredients that unifies a broad range of nonlinear optimization solvers. This framework has been implemented in the open-source solver Uno, a Swiss Army knife-like C++ optimization framework that unifies many nonlinearly constrained nonconvex optimization solvers. We illustrate the framework with a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm that maintains an acceptable upper bound on the constraint violation, called a funnel, that is monotonically decreased to control the feasibility of the iterates. Infeasible quadratic subproblems are handled by a feasibility restoration strategy. Globalization is controlled by a line search or a trust-region method. We prove global convergence of the trust-region funnel SQP method, building on known results from filter methods. We implement the algorithm in Uno, and we provide extensive test results for the trust-region line-search funnel SQP on small CUTEst instances.</description>

      <title>Addressing Discrete Dynamic Optimization via a Logic-Based Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic optimization problems involving discrete decisions have several applications, yet lead to challenging optimization problems that must be addressed efficiently. Combining discrete variables with potentially nonlinear constraints stemming from dynamics within an optimization model results in mathematical programs for which off-the-shelf techniques might be insufficient. This work uses a novel approach, the Logic-based Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm (LD-SDA), to solve Discrete Dynamic Optimization problems. The problems are formulated using Boolean variables that enforce differential systems of constraints and encode logic constraints that the optimization problem needs to satisfy. By posing the problem as a generalized disjunctive program with dynamic equations within the disjunctions, the LD-SDA takes advantage of the problem's inherent structure to efficiently explore the combinatorial space of the Boolean variables and selectively include relevant differential equations to mitigate the computational complexity inherent in dynamic optimization scenarios. We rigorously evaluate the LD-SDA with benchmark problems from the literature that include dynamic transitioning modes and find it to outperform traditional methods, i.e., mixed-integer nonlinear and generalized disjunctive programming solvers, in terms of efficiency and capability to handle dynamic scenarios. This work presents a systematic method and provides an open-source software implementation to address these discrete dynamic optimization problems by harnessing the information within its logical-differential structure.</description>

      <title>Optimal Adaptive Control of Linear Stochastic Systems with Quadratic Cost Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the adaptive linear quadratic Gaussian control problem, where both the linear transformation matrix of the state $A$ and the control gain matrix $B$ are unknown. The proposed adaptive optimal control only assumes that $(A, B)$ is stabilizable and $(A, Q^{1/2})$ is detectable, where $Q$ is the weighting matrix of the state in the quadratic cost function. This condition significantly weakens the classic assumptions used in the literature. To tackle this problem, a weighted least squares algorithm is modified by using random regularization method, which can ensure uniform stabilizability and uniform detectability of the family of estimated models. At the same time, a diminishing excitation is incorporated into the design of the proposed adaptive control to guarantee strong consistency of the desired components of the estimates. Finally, by utilizing this family of estimates, even if not all components of them converge to the true values, it is demonstrated that a certainty equivalence control with such a diminishing excitation is optimal for an ergodic quadratic cost function.</description>

      <title>Initial Error Affection and Error Correction in Linear Quadratic Mean Field Games under Erroneous Initial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the initial error affection and error correction in linear quadratic mean field games (MPLQMFGs) under erroneous initial distribution information are investigated. First, a LQMFG model is developed where agents are coupled by dynamics and cost functions. Next, by studying the evolutionary of LQMFGs under erroneous initial distributions information, the affection of initial error on the game and agents' strategies are given. Furthermore, under deterministic situation, we provide a sufficient condition for agents to correct initial error and give their optimal strategies when agents are allowed to change their strategies at a intermediate time. Besides, the situation where agents are allowed to predict MF and adjust their strategies in real-time is considered. Finally, simulations are performed to verify above conclusions.</description>

      <title>Constraints-Informed Neural-Laguerre Approximation of Nonlinear MPC with Application in Power Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers learning online (implicit) nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) laws using neural networks and Laguerre functions. Firstly, we parameterize the control sequence of nonlinear MPC using Laguerre functions, which typically yields a smoother control law compared to the original nonlinear MPC law. Secondly, we employ neural networks to learn the coefficients of the Laguerre nonlinear MPC solution, which comes with several benefits, namely the dimension of the learning space is dictated by the number of Laguerre functions and the complete predicted input sequence can be used to learn the coefficients. To mitigate constraints violation for neural approximations of nonlinear MPC, we develop a constraints-informed loss function that penalizes the violation of polytopic state constraints during learning. Box input constraints are handled by using a clamp function in the output layer of the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework on a nonlinear buck-boost converter model with sampling rates in the sub-millisecond range, where online nonlinear MPC would not be able to run in real time. The developed constraints-informed neural-Laguerre approximation yields similar performance with long-horizon online nonlinear MPC, but with execution times of a few microseconds, as validated on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform.</description>

      <title>Observability inequalities for heat equations with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the observability inequalities for heat equations with time-dependent Lipschtiz potentials. The observability inequality for heat equations asserts that the total energy of a solution is bounded above by the energy localized in a subdomain with an observability constant. For a bounded measurable potential $V = V(x,t)$, the factor in the observability constant arising from the Carleman estimate is best known to be $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ (even for time-independent potentials). In this paper, we show that, for Lipschtiz potentials, this factor can be replaced by $\exp(C(\|\nabla V\|_{\infty}^{1/2} +\|\partial_tV\|_{\infty}^{1/3} ))$, which improves the previous bound $\exp(C\|V\|_{\infty}^{2/3})$ in some typical scenarios. As a consequence, with such a Lipschitz potential, we obtain a quantitative regular control in a null controllability problem. In addition, for the one-dimensional heat equation with some time-independent bounded measurable potential $V = V(x)$, we obtain the optimal observability constant.</description>

      <title>Lossy Image Compression with Stochastic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossy image compression algorithms play a crucial role in various domains, including graphics, and image processing. As image information density increases, so do the resources required for processing and transmission. One of the most prominent approaches to address this challenge is color quantization, proposed by Orchard et al. (1991). This technique optimally maps each pixel of an image to a color from a limited palette, maintaining image resolution while significantly reducing information content. Color quantization can be interpreted as a clustering problem (Krishna et al. (1997), Wan (2019)), where image pixels are represented in a three-dimensional space, with each axis corresponding to the intensity of an RGB channel. However, scaling of traditional algorithms like K-Means can be challenging for large data, such as modern images with millions of colors. This paper reframes color quantization as a three-dimensional stochastic transportation problem between the set of image pixels and an optimal color palette, where the number of colors is a predefined hyperparameter. We employ Stochastic Quantization (SQ) with a seeding technique proposed by Arthur et al. (2007) to enhance the scalability of color quantization. This method introduces a probabilistic element to the quantization process, potentially improving efficiency and adaptability to diverse image characteristics. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present experimental results using images from the ImageNet dataset. These experiments illustrate the performance of our Stochastic Quantization method in terms of compression quality, computational efficiency, and scalability compared to traditional color quantization techniques.</description>

Abstract: The data-driven techniques have been developed to deal with the output regulation problem of unknown linear systems by various approaches. In this paper, we first extend an existing algorithm from single-input single-output linear systems to multi-input multi-output linear systems. Then, by separating the dynamics used in the learning phase and the control phase, we further propose an improved algorithm that significantly reduces the computational cost and weakens the solvability conditions over the first algorithm.</description>

      <title>A kernel-based PEM estimator for forward model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning the impulse responses characterizing forward models by means of a regularized kernel-based Prediction Error Method (PEM). The common approach to accomplish that is to approximate the system with a high-order stable ARX model. However, such choice induces a certain undesired prior information in the system that we want to estimate. To overcome this issue, we propose a new kernel-based paradigm which is formulated directly in terms of the impulse responses of the forward model and leading to the identification of a high-order MAX model. The most challenging step is the estimation of the kernel hyperparameters optimizing the marginal likelihood. The latter, indeed, does not admit a closed form expression. We propose a method for evaluating the marginal likelihood which makes possible the hyperparameters estimation. Finally, some numerical results showing the effectiveness of the method are presented.</description>

      <title>Introducing DAIMYO: a first-time-right dynamic design architecture and its application to tail-sitter UAS development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable evolution in various multidisciplinary design methodologies for dynamic systems. Among these approaches, a noteworthy concept is that of concurrent conceptual and control design or co-design. This approach involves the tuning of feedforward and/or feedback control strategies in conjunction with the conceptual design of the dynamic system. The primary aim is to discover integrated solutions that surpass those attainable through a disjointed or decoupled approach. This concurrent design paradigm exhibits particular promise in the context of hybrid unmanned aerial systems (UASs), such as tail-sitters, where the objectives of versatility (driven by control considerations) and efficiency (influenced by conceptual design) often present conflicting demands. Nevertheless, a persistent challenge lies in the potential disparity between the theoretical models that underpin the design process and the real-world operational environment, the so-called reality gap. Such disparities can lead to suboptimal performance when the designed system is deployed in reality. To address this issue, this paper introduces DAIMYO, a novel design architecture that incorporates a high-fidelity environment, which emulates real-world conditions, into the procedure in pursuit of a `first-time-right' design. The outcome of this innovative approach is a design procedure that yields versatile and efficient UAS designs capable of withstanding the challenges posed by the reality gap.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the generalized maximal covering location problem (GMCLP) which establishes a fixed number of facilities to maximize the weighted sum of the covered customers, allowing customers' weights to be positive or negative. The GMCLP can be modeled as a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and solved by off-the-shelf MIP solvers. However, due to the large problem size and particularly, poor linear programming (LP) relaxation, the GMCLP is extremely difficult to solve by state-of-the-art MIP solvers. To improve the computational performance of MIP-based approaches for solving GMCLPs, we propose customized presolving and cutting plane techniques, which are the isomorphic aggregation, dominance reduction, and two-customer inequalities. The isomorphic aggregation and dominance reduction can not only reduce the problem size but also strengthen the LP relaxation of the MIP formulation of the GMCLP. The two-customer inequalities can be embedded into a branch-and-cut framework to further strengthen the LP relaxation of the MIP formulation on the fly. By extensive computational experiments, we show that all three proposed techniques can substantially improve the capability of MIP solvers in solving GMCLPs. In particular, for a testbed of 40 instances with identical numbers of customers and facilities in the literature, the proposed techniques enable to provide optimal solutions for 13 previously unsolved benchmark instances; for a testbed of 56 instances where the number of customers is much larger than the number of facilities, the proposed techniques can turn most of them from intractable to easily solvable.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Motion Camouflage Under Escape Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion camouflage can be a useful tactic for a pursuer attempting to conceal their true trajectory from their target. Many previous studies determine optimal trajectories subject to motion camouflage constraints, but these analyses do not address when it is optimal to use, nor do they account for the pursuer's inability to predict if and when the target will try to escape. We present an optimal control framework to determine when the pursuer should use motion camouflage amidst uncertainty in the target's escape attempt time. Focusing on the illustrative problem of a male hover fly pursuing a female hover fly for mating, we model the female fly's escape response as the result of a non-homogeneous Poisson point process with a biologically informed rate function, and we obtain and numerically solve two Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDEs which encode the pursuer's optimal trajectories. Our numerical experiments and statistics illustrate when it is optimal to use motion camouflage pursuit tactics under varying degrees of the target's visual acuity and tolerance to the pursuer's presence.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Optimal Geodesic Curvature Constrained Dubins' Path on Sphere with Free Terminal Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, motion planning for a Dubins vehicle on a unit sphere to attain a desired final location is considered. The radius of the Dubins path on the sphere is lower bounded by $r$. In a previous study, this problem was addressed, wherein it was shown that the optimal path is of type $CG, CC,$ or a degenerate path of the same for $r \leq \frac{1}{2}.$ Here, $C = L, R$ denotes an arc of a tight left or right turn of minimum turning radius $r,$ and $G$ denotes an arc of a great circle. In this study, the candidate paths for the same problem are generalized to model vehicles with a larger turning radius. In particular, it is shown that the candidate optimal paths are of type $CG, CC,$ or a degenerate path of the same for $r \leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$ Noting that at most two $LG$ paths and two $RG$ paths can exist for a given final location, this article further reduces the candidate optimal paths by showing that only one $LG$ and one $RG$ path can be optimal, yielding a total of seven candidate paths for $r \leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$ Additional conditions for the optimality of $CC$ paths are also derived in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage best response dynamics to solve monotone variational inequalities on compact and convex sets. Specialization of the method to variational inequalities in game theory recovers convergence results to Nash equilibria when agents select the best response to the current distribution of strategies. We apply the method to generalize population games with additional convex constraints. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the method by introducing various types of time-varying disturbances.</description>

      <title>A first-order greedy algorithm for A-optimal experimental design with optimality guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design (OED) concerns itself with identifying ideal methods of data collection, e.g.~via sensor placement. The \emph{greedy algorithm}, that is, placing one sensor at a time, in an iteratively optimal manner, stands as an extremely robust and easily executed algorithm for this purpose. However, it is a priori unclear whether this algorithm leads to sub-optimal regimes. Taking advantage of the author's recent work on non-smooth convex optimality criteria for OED, we here present a framework for verifying global optimality for the greedy algorithm, as well as employing gradient-based speed-ups.</description>

      <title>Improving the Solution of Indefinite Quadratic Programs and Linear Programs with Complementarity Constraints by a Progressive MIP Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indefinite quadratic programs (QPs) are known to be very difficult to be solved to global optimality, so are linear programs with linear complementarity constraints. Treating the former as a subclass of the latter, this paper presents a progressive mixed integer linear programming method for solving a general linear program with linear complementarity constraints (LPCC). Instead of solving the LPCC with a full set of integer variables expressing the complementarity conditions, the presented method solves a finite number of mixed integer subprograms by starting with a small fraction of integer variables and progressively increasing this fraction. After describing the PIP (for progressive integer programming) method and its various implementations, we demonstrate, via an extensive set of computational experiments, the superior performance of the progressive approach over the direct solution of the full-integer formulation of the LPCCs. It is also shown that the solution obtained at the termination of the PIP method is a local minimizer of the LPCC, a property that cannot be claimed by any known non-enumerative method for solving this nonconvex program. In all the experiments, the PIP method is initiated at a feasible solution of the LPCC obtained from a nonlinear programming solver, and with high likelihood, can successfully improve it. Thus, the PIP method can improve a stationary solution of an indefinite QP, something that is not likely to be achievable by a nonlinear programming method. Finally, some analysis is presented that provides a better understanding of the roles of the LPCC suboptimal solutions in the local optimality of the indefinite QP.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow approach for combined layout-control design of wave energy parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave energy converters (WECs) represent an innovative technology for power generation from renewable sources (marine energy). Although there has been a great deal of research into such devices in recent decades, the power output of a single device has remained low. Therefore, installation in parks is required for economic reasons. The optimal design problem for parks of WECs is challenging since it requires the simultaneous optimization of positions and control parameters. While the literature on this problem usually considers metaheuristic algorithms, we present a novel numerical framework based on a gradient-flow formulation. This framework is capable of solving the optimal design problem for WEC parks. In particular, we use a low-order adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme to integrate the gradient-flow equation and introduce an inexact solution procedure. Here, the tolerances of the linear solver used for projection on the constraint nullspace and of the time-advancing scheme are automatically adapted to avoid over-solving so that the method requires minimal tuning. We then provide the specific details of its application to the considered WEC problem: the goal is to maximize the average power produced by a park, subject to hydrodynamic and dynamic governing equations and to the constraints of available sea area, minimum distance between devices, and limited oscillation amplitude around the undisturbed free surface elevation. A suitable choice of the discrete models allows us to compute analytically the Jacobian of the state problem's residual. Numerical tests with realistic parameters show that the proposed algorithm is efficient, and results of physical interest are obtained.</description>

      <title>Matrix Completion and Decomposition in Phase Bounded Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of matrix completion and decomposition in the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices is a well-understood problem, with many important applications in areas such as linear algebra, optimization, and control theory. This paper considers the completion and decomposition problems in a broader class of cones, namely phase-bounded cones. We show that most of the main results from the PSD case carry over to the phase-bounded case. More precisely, this is done by first unveiling a duality between the completion and decomposition problems, using a dual cone interpretation. Based on this, we then derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the phase-bounded completion and decomposition problems, and also characterize all phase-bounded completions of a completable partial matrix with a banded pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-stage decision-making under uncertainty, where decisions are taken under sequentially revealing uncertain problem parameters, is often essential to faithfully model managerial problems. Given the significant computational challenges involved, these problems are typically solved approximately. This short note introduces an algorithmic framework that revisits a popular approximation scheme for multi-stage stochastic programs by Georghiou et al. (2015) and improves upon it to deliver superior policies in the stochastic setting, as well as extend its applicability to robust optimization and a contemporary Wasserstein-based data-driven setting. We demonstrate how the policies of our framework can be computed efficiently, and we present numerical experiments that highlight the benefits of our method.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Pipeline for Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization with Applications to Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Meaningful Local Guarantees in Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, with the algorithm assumed to have access only to local function information. It has been shown by Davis, Drusvyatskiy, and Jiang (2023) that for nonsmooth Lipschitz functions satisfying certain regularity and strictness conditions, perturbed gradient descent converges to local minimizers asymptotically. Motivated by this result and by other recent algorithmic advances in nonconvex nonsmooth optimization concerning Goldstein stationarity, we consider the question of obtaining a non-asymptotic rate of convergence to local minima for this problem class.
  We provide the following negative answer to this question: Local algorithms acting on regular Lipschitz functions cannot, in the worst case, provide meaningful local guarantees in terms of function value in sub-exponential time, even when all near-stationary points are global minima. This sharply contrasts with the smooth setting, for which it is well-known that standard gradient methods can do so in a dimension-independent rate. Our result complements the rich body of work in the theoretical computer science literature that provide hardness results conditional on conjectures such as $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ or cryptographic assumptions, in that ours holds unconditional of any such assumptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geodesic Curvature Constrained Dubins' Path on Sphere with Free Terminal Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, motion planning for a vehicle moving on a unit sphere with unit speed is considered, wherein the desired terminal location is fixed, but the terminal orientation is free. The motion of the vehicle is modeled to be constrained by a maximum geodesic curvature $U_{max},$ which controls the rate of change of heading of the vehicle such that the maximum heading change occurs when the vehicle travels on a tight circular arc of radius $r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + U_{max}^2}}$. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the main result of this paper shows that for $r \leq \frac{1}{2}$, the optimal path connecting a given initial configuration and a final location on the sphere belongs to a set of at most seven paths. The candidate paths are of type $CG, CC,$ and degenerate paths of the same, where $C \in \{L, R\}$ denotes a tight left or right turn, respectively, and $G$ denotes a great circular arc.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Black Box Conditional Gradient: Variance Reduction and One Point Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10442v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the black-box optimization problem. In this setup, we do not have access to the gradient of the objective function, therefore, we need to estimate it somehow. We propose a new type of approximation JAGUAR, that memorizes information from previous iterations and requires $\mathcal{O}(1)$ oracle calls. We implement this approximation in the Frank-Wolfe and Gradient Descent algorithms and prove the convergence of these methods with different types of zero-order oracle. Our theoretical analysis covers scenarios of non-convex, convex and PL-condition cases. Also in this paper, we consider the stochastic minimization problem on the set $Q$ with noise in the zero-order oracle; this setup is quite unpopular in the literature, but we prove that the JAGUAR approximation is robust not only in deterministic minimization problems, but also in the stochastic case. We perform experiments to compare our gradient estimator with those already known in the literature and confirm the dominance of our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g. annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be time-inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.</description>

      <title>Online Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization with Bregman Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization methods are increasingly relevant within machine learning, especially for tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Compared to the offline setting, online bilevel optimization (OBO) offers a more dynamic framework by accommodating time-varying functions and sequentially arriving data. This study addresses the online nonconvex-strongly convex bilevel optimization problem. In deterministic settings, we introduce a novel online Bregman bilevel optimizer (OBBO) that utilizes adaptive Bregman divergences. We demonstrate that OBBO enhances the known sublinear rates for bilevel local regret through a novel hypergradient error decomposition that adapts to the underlying geometry of the problem. In stochastic contexts, we introduce the first stochastic online bilevel optimizer (SOBBO), which employs a window averaging method for updating outer-level variables using a weighted average of recent stochastic approximations of hypergradients. This approach not only achieves sublinear rates of bilevel local regret but also serves as an effective variance reduction strategy, obviating the need for additional stochastic gradient samples at each timestep. Experiments on online hyperparameter optimization and online meta-learning highlight the superior performance, efficiency, and adaptability of our Bregman-based algorithms compared to established online and offline bilevel benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Local SGD for Near-Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under Unconstrained Noise Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large-scale machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new concept of $\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition, existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We, in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the class of studied problems.</description>

      <title>Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict-then-optimize framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability, and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge, no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context of model misspecification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a full analytic solution to a particular case of the algebraic Riccati equation $XWW^*WX=W^*$ for any matrix $W$ (possibly non-square or non-symmetric) in using the Schur method, terms of the SVD decomposition of $W$. In particular, $(WX)^3=WX$ and $(XW)^3=XW$ for any solution $X$. We show that for $W=AB$, matrix $X=B^+ A^+$ is a solution of this equation if and only if the reverse order law holds, i.e., ${(AB)}^+=B^+ A^+$. For a Hermitian and invertible $W$ the maximal and stabilizing Hermitian solutions is shown to be equal to $W^+$. Equivalence to the equation $XWX=W^+$ is proven.</description>

      <title>Distributed Binary Optimization with In-Memory Computing: An Application for the SAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an IMC-compatible parallelism framework inspired by parallel tempering (PT), enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers. This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the traditional WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 76.3% of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT) does so in 68.4% of the instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of the total energy required to run each accelerator.</description>

      <title>The exponential turnpike phenomenon for mean field game systems: weakly monotone drifts and small interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims at quantifying the long time behavior of solutions of mean field PDE systems arising in the theory of Mean Field Games and McKean-Vlasov control. Our main contribution is to show well-posedness of the ergodic problem and the exponential turnpike property of dynamic optimizers, which implies exponential convergence to equilibrium for both optimal states and controls to their ergodic counterparts. In contrast with previous works that require some version of the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, our main assumption is a weak form of asymptotic monotonicity on the drift of the controlled dynamics and some basic regularity and smallness conditions on the interaction terms. Our proof strategy is probabilistic and based on the construction of contractive couplings between controlled processes and forward-backward stochastic differential equations. The flexibility of the coupling approach allows us to cover several interesting situations. For example, we do not need to restrict ourselves to compact domains and can work on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can cover the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients and we can sometimes show turnpike estimates for the hessians of solutions to the backward equation.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Based Synchronization and the Low-Rankness of the Block Trifocal Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The block tensor of trifocal tensors provides crucial geometric information on the three-view geometry of a scene. The underlying synchronization problem seeks to recover camera poses (locations and orientations up to a global transformation) from the block trifocal tensor. We establish an explicit Tucker factorization of this tensor, revealing a low multilinear rank of $(6,4,4)$ independent of the number of cameras under appropriate scaling conditions. We prove that this rank constraint provides sufficient information for camera recovery in the noiseless case. The constraint motivates a synchronization algorithm based on the higher-order singular value decomposition of the block trifocal tensor. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art global synchronization methods on real datasets demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for significantly improving location estimation accuracy. Overall this work suggests that higher-order interactions in synchronization problems can be exploited to improve performance, beyond the usual pairwise-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the reachability problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. Our goal is to present a unified framework for calculating the probabilistic reachable set of discrete-time systems in the presence of both deterministic input and stochastic noise. By adopting a suitable separation strategy, the probabilistic reachable set is decoupled into a deterministic reachable set and the effect of the stochastic noise. To capture the effect of the stochastic noise, in particular sub-Gaussian noise, we provide a probabilistic bound on the distance between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is a novel energy function called the Averaged Moment Generating Function, which we leverage to provide a high probability bound on this distance. We show that this probabilistic bound is tight for a large class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems and is exact for linear stochastic dynamics. By combining this tight probabilistic bound with the existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we propose a flexible framework that can efficiently compute probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic systems. We also provide two case studies for applying our framework to Lipschitz bound reachability and interval-based reachability. Three numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in semi-supervised cases, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) framework which leverages the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, we generalize the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for semi-supervised learning in [24] to incorporate a more general optimization functional. Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evaluating probabilistic and data-driven inference models for fiber-coupled NV-diamond temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</description>

      <title>Using Synthetic Data to Mitigate Unfairness and Preserve Privacy through Single-Shot Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address unfairness issues in federated learning (FL), contemporary approaches typically use frequent model parameter updates and transmissions between the clients and server. In such a process, client-specific information (e.g., local dataset size or data-related fairness metrics) must be sent to the server to compute, e.g., aggregation weights. All of this results in high transmission costs and the potential leakage of client information. As an alternative, we propose a strategy that promotes fair predictions across clients without the need to pass information between the clients and server iteratively and prevents client data leakage. For each client, we first use their local dataset to obtain a synthetic dataset by solving a bilevel optimization problem that addresses unfairness concerns during the learning process. We then pass each client's synthetic dataset to the server, the collection of which is used to train the server model using conventional machine learning techniques (that do not take fairness metrics into account). Thus, we eliminate the need to handle fairness-specific aggregation weights while preserving client privacy. Our approach requires only a single communication between the clients and the server, thus making it computationally cost-effective, able to maintain privacy, and able to ensuring fairness. We present empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The results illustrate that our method effectively uses synthetic data as a means to mitigate unfairness and preserve client privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present novel convex optimization formulations for designing full-state and output-feedback controllers with sparse actuation that achieve user-specified $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance criteria. For output-feedback control, we extend these formulations to simultaneously design control laws with sparse actuation and sensing. The sparsity is induced through the minimization of a weighted $\ell_1$ norm, promoting the efficient use of sensors and actuators while maintaining desired closed-loop performance. The proposed methods are applied to a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, demonstrating the advantages of simultaneous optimization of the control law, sensing, and actuation architecture in realizing an efficient closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>HJ-sampler: A Bayesian sampler for inverse problems of a stochastic process by leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs and score-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between stochastic processes and optimal control has been extensively explored in the literature. With the recent surge in the use of diffusion models, stochastic processes have increasingly been applied to sample generation. This paper builds on the log transform, known as the Cole-Hopf transform in Brownian motion contexts, and extends it within a more abstract framework that includes a linear operator. Within this framework, we found that the well-known relationship between the Cole-Hopf transform and optimal transport is a particular instance where the linear operator acts as the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic process. We also introduce a novel scenario where the linear operator is the adjoint of the generator, linking to Bayesian inference under specific initial and terminal conditions. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we develop a new algorithm, named the HJ-sampler, for Bayesian inference for the inverse problem of a stochastic differential equation with given terminal observations. The HJ-sampler involves two stages: (1) solving the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, and (2) sampling from the associated stochastic optimal control problem. Our proposed algorithm naturally allows for flexibility in selecting the numerical solver for viscous HJ PDEs. We introduce two variants of the solver: the Riccati-HJ-sampler, based on the Riccati method, and the SGM-HJ-sampler, which utilizes diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods by applying them to solve Bayesian inverse problems involving various stochastic processes and prior distributions, including applications that address model misspecifications and quantifying model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Dimensionality in 2D Rectangle Packing Problem under Reinforcement Learning Schema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the two-dimensional rectangular packing problem. We propose a reduced representation of the state and action spaces that allow us for high granularity. Leveraging UNet architecture and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we achieved a model that is comparable to the MaxRect heuristic. However, our approach has great potential to be generalized to nonrectangular packing problems and complex constraints.</description>

      <title>Training Safe Neural Networks with Global SDP Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to training neural networks with formal safety guarantees using semidefinite programming (SDP) for verification. Our method focuses on verifying safety over large, high-dimensional input regions, addressing limitations of existing techniques that focus on adversarial robustness bounds. We introduce an ADMM-based training scheme for an accurate neural network classifier on the Adversarial Spheres dataset, achieving provably perfect recall with input dimensions up to $d=40$. This work advances the development of reliable neural network verification methods for high-dimensional systems, with potential applications in safe RL policies.</description>

      <title>The Optimality of (Accelerated) SGD for High-Dimensional Quadratic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a widely used algorithm in machine learning, particularly for neural network training. Recent studies on SGD for canonical quadratic optimization or linear regression show it attains well generalization under suitable high-dimensional settings. However, a fundamental question -- for what kinds of high-dimensional learning problems SGD and its accelerated variants can achieve optimality has yet to be well studied. This paper investigates SGD with two essential components in practice: exponentially decaying step size schedule and momentum. We establish the convergence upper bound for momentum accelerated SGD (ASGD) and propose concrete classes of learning problems under which SGD or ASGD achieves min-max optimal convergence rates. The characterization of the target function is based on standard power-law decays in (functional) linear regression. Our results unveil new insights for understanding the learning bias of SGD: (i) SGD is efficient in learning ``dense'' features where the corresponding weights are subject to an infinity norm constraint; (ii) SGD is efficient for easy problem without suffering from the saturation effect; (iii) momentum can accelerate the convergence rate by order when the learning problem is relatively hard. To our knowledge, this is the first work to clearly identify the optimal boundary of SGD versus ASGD for the problem under mild settings.</description>

      <title>RandALO: Out-of-sample risk estimation in no time flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating out-of-sample risk for models trained on large high-dimensional datasets is an expensive but essential part of the machine learning process, enabling practitioners to optimally tune hyperparameters. Cross-validation (CV) serves as the de facto standard for risk estimation but poorly trades off high bias ($K$-fold CV) for computational cost (leave-one-out CV). We propose a randomized approximate leave-one-out (RandALO) risk estimator that is not only a consistent estimator of risk in high dimensions but also less computationally expensive than $K$-fold CV. We support our claims with extensive simulations on synthetic and real data and provide a user-friendly Python package implementing RandALO available on PyPI as randalo and at https://github.com/cvxgrp/randalo.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Near-Linear Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution captures the statistics of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. Classical particle filters provably approximate this distribution in quite general settings; however they behave poorly for high dimensional problems, suffering weight collapse. This issue is circumvented by the ensemble Kalman filter which is an equal-weight interacting particle system. However, this finite particle system is only proven to approximate the true filter in the linear Gaussian case. In practice, however, it is applied in much broader settings; as a result, establishing its approximation properties more generally is important. There has been recent progress in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, establishing stability and error estimates in non-Gaussian settings, but the assumptions on the dynamics and observation models rule out the unbounded vector fields that arise in practice and the analysis applies only to the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The present work establishes error bounds between the filtering distribution and the finite particle ensemble Kalman filter when the model exhibits linear growth.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Event-Triggered Systems: Safe Learning of Quasi-Optimal Deadline Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical architecture to improve the efficiency of event-triggered control (ETC) in reducing resource consumption. This paper considers event-triggered systems generally as an impulsive control system in which the objective is to minimize the number of impulses. Our architecture recognizes that traditional ETC is a greedy strategy towards optimizing average inter-event times and introduces the idea of a deadline policy for the optimization of long-term discounted inter-event times. A lower layer is designed employing event-triggered control to guarantee the satisfaction of control objectives, while a higher layer implements a deadline policy designed with reinforcement learning to improve the discounted inter-event time. We apply this scheme to the control of an orbiting spacecraft, showing superior performance in terms of actuation frequency reduction with respect to a standard (one-layer) ETC while maintaining safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Critic as Lyapunov function (CALF): a model-free, stability-ensuring agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents and showcases a novel reinforcement learning agent called Critic As Lyapunov Function (CALF) which is model-free and ensures online environment, in other words, dynamical system stabilization. Online means that in each learning episode, the said environment is stabilized. This, as demonstrated in a case study with a mobile robot simulator, greatly improves the overall learning performance. The base actor-critic scheme of CALF is analogous to SARSA. The latter did not show any success in reaching the target in our studies. However, a modified version thereof, called SARSA-m here, did succeed in some learning scenarios. Still, CALF greatly outperformed the said approach. CALF was also demonstrated to improve a nominal stabilizer provided to it. In summary, the presented agent may be considered a viable approach to fusing classical control with reinforcement learning. Its concurrent approaches are mostly either offline or model-based, like, for instance, those that fuse model-predictive control into the agent.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Sharpness-Aware Minimization Algorithms using Increasing Batch Size and Decaying Learning Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) algorithm and its variants, including gap guided SAM (GSAM), have been successful at improving the generalization capability of deep neural network models by finding flat local minima of the empirical loss in training. Meanwhile, it has been shown theoretically and practically that increasing the batch size or decaying the learning rate avoids sharp local minima of the empirical loss. In this paper, we consider the GSAM algorithm with increasing batch sizes or decaying learning rates, such as cosine annealing or linear learning rate, and theoretically show its convergence. Moreover, we numerically compare SAM (GSAM) with and without an increasing batch size and conclude that using an increasing batch size or decaying learning rate finds flatter local minima than using a constant batch size and learning rate.</description>

      <title>An integrated design of robust decentralized observer and controller for load frequency control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing completely decentralized load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems to achieve global optimized performance. To this end, a new concept of integrated design is introduced for designing the decentralized LFC observers and controllers simultaneously off-line, by taking into account of the interactions between areas and the bidirectional effects between the local observer and controller in each area. The integrated design in this paper is realized via $H_\infty$ optimization with a single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation. The LMI regional eigenvalue assignment technique is further incorporated with $H_\infty$ optimization to improve the closed-loop system transient performance. A three-area power system is simulated to validate the superiority of the proposed integrated design over the conventional decentralized designs.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation schemes for scheduling on a stochastic number of machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three two-stage optimization problems with a similar structure and different objectives. In the first stage of each problem, the goal is to assign input jobs of positive sizes to unsplittable bags. After this assignment is decided, the realization of the number of identical machines that will be available is revealed. Then, in the second stage, the bags are assigned to machines. The probability vector of the number of machines in the second stage is known to the algorithm as part of the input before making the decisions of the first stage. Thus, the vector of machine completion times is a random variable. The goal of the first problem is to minimize the expected value of the makespan of the second stage schedule, while the goal of the second problem is to maximize the expected value of the minimum completion time of the machines in the second stage solution. The goal of the third problem is to minimize the \ell_p norm for a fixed p&gt;1, where the norm is applied on machines' completion times vectors. Each one of the first two problems admits a PTAS as Buchem et al. showed recently. Here we significantly improve all their results by designing an EPTAS for each one of these problems. We also design an EPTAS for \ell_p norm minimization for any p&gt;1.</description>

      <title>Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Neumann Boundary Condition with a Point-Wise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of controllability and approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w_{x_1}(0,x_2,t)=u(t)\delta(x_2)$, $x_1&gt;0$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u\in L^\infty(0,T)$ is a control. To this aid, it is investigated the set $\mathcal{R}_T(0)\subset L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ of its end states which are reachable from $0$. It is established that a function $f\in\mathcal{R}_T(0)$ can be represented in the form $f(x)=g\big(|x|^2\big)$ a.e. in $(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R$ where $g\in L^2(0,+\infty)$. In fact, we reduce the problem dealing with functions from $L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ to a problem dealing with functions from $L^2(0,+\infty)$. Both a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability and a sufficient condition for approximate controllability in a given time $T$ under a control $u$ bounded by a given constant are obtained in terms of solvability of a Markov power moment problem. Using the Laguerre functions (forming an orthonormal basis of $L^2(0,+\infty)$), necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate controllability and numerical solutions to the approximate controllability problem are obtained. It is also shown that there is no initial state that is null-controllable in a given time $T$. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of approximate joint diagonalization of a collection of matrices arises in a number of diverse engineering and signal processing problems. This problem is usually cast as an optimization problem, and it is the main goal of this publication to provide a theoretical study of the corresponding cost-functional. As our main result, we prove that this functional tends to infinity in the vicinity of rank-deficient matrices with probability one, thereby proving that the optimization problem is well posed. Secondly, we provide unified expressions for its higher-order derivatives in multilinear form, and explicit expressions for the gradient and the Hessian of the functional in standard form, thereby opening for new improved numerical schemes for the solution of the joint diagonalization problem. A special section is devoted to the important case of self-adjoint matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven stochastic model predictive control framework for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach leverages multi-step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we present a strategy to identify multi-step predictors and quantify the associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data-driven) state space model. Then, we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Curse of Scale-Freeness: Intractability of Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization with Multi-Start Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16678v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intractability of large-scale optimization using multi-start methods. For the theoretical performance analysis, we focus on random multi-start (RMS), one of the representative multi-start methods, including RMS local search and greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). Our primary theoretical contribution is to derive, using extreme value theory, power-law formulas for the two quantities: (i) the expected improvement rate of the best empirical objective value (EOV); (ii) the expected relative gap between the best EOV and the supremum of empirical objective values. Notably, the expected relative gap exhibits scale-freeness as a function of the number of iterations. Consequently, the half-life of the expected relative gap is ultimately proportional to the number of iterations completed by an RMS algorithm. This result can be interpreted as the curse of scale-freeness -- a Zeno's paradox-like phenomenon, encapsulated by the metaphor ``reaching for the goal makes it slip away." Through numerical experiments, we observe that applying several RMS algorithms to traveling salesman problems is subject to the curse of scale-freeness. Furthermore, we show that overcoming this curse requires developing a powerful LS algorithm equipped with a diversification mechanism that is exponentially more effective than RMS.</description>

Abstract: We study dynamic traffic assignment with side-constraints. We first give a counter-example to a key result from the literature regarding the existence of dynamic equilibria for volume-constrained traffic models in the classical edge-delay model. Our counter-example shows that the feasible flow space need not be convex and it further reveals that classical infinite dimensional variational inequalities are not suited for the definition of side-constrained dynamic equilibria. We propose a new framework for side-constrained dynamic equilibria based on the concept of feasible $\gamma$-deviations of flow particles in space and time. Under natural assumptions, we characterize the resulting equilibria by means of quasi-variational and variational inequalities, respectively. Finally, we establish first existence results for side-constrained dynamic equilibria for the non-convex setting of volume-constraints.</description>

      <title>Sarah Frank-Wolfe: Methods for Constrained Optimization with Best Rates and Practical Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frank-Wolfe (FW) method is a popular approach for solving optimization problems with structured constraints that arise in machine learning applications. In recent years, stochastic versions of FW have gained popularity, motivated by large datasets for which the computation of the full gradient is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present two new variants of the FW algorithms for stochastic finite-sum minimization. Our algorithms have the best convergence guarantees of existing stochastic FW approaches for both convex and non-convex objective functions. Our methods do not have the issue of permanently collecting large batches, which is common to many stochastic projection-free approaches. Moreover, our second approach does not require either large batches or full deterministic gradients, which is a typical weakness of many techniques for finite-sum problems. The faster theoretical rates of our approaches are confirmed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Design of Accelerated Composite Optimization Methods: OptISTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated composite optimization method FISTA (Beck, Teboulle 2009) is suboptimal, and we present a new method OptISTA that improves upon it by a factor of 2. The performance estimation problem (PEP) has recently been introduced as a new computer-assisted paradigm for designing optimal first-order methods, but the methodology was largely limited to unconstrained optimization with a single function. In this work, we present a novel double-function stepsize-optimization PEP methodology that poses the optimization over fixed-step first-order methods for composite optimization as a finite-dimensional nonconvex QCQP, which can be practically solved through spatial branch-and-bound algorithms, and use it to design the exact optimal method OptISTA for the composite optimization setup. We then establish the exact optimality of OptISTA with a novel lower-bound construction that extends the semi-interpolated zero-chain construction (Drori, Taylor 2022) to the double-function setup of composite optimization. By establishing exact optimality, our work concludes the search for the fastest first-order methods for the proximal, projected-gradient, and proximal-gradient setups.</description>

      <title>Specifying and Solving Robust Empirical Risk Minimization Problems Using CVXPY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider robust empirical risk minimization (ERM), where model parameters are chosen to minimize the worst-case empirical loss when each data point varies over a given convex uncertainty set. In some simple cases, such problems can be expressed in an analytical form. In general the problem can be made tractable via dualization, which turns a min-max problem into a min-min problem. Dualization requires expertise and is tedious and error-prone. We demonstrate how CVXPY can be used to automate this dualization procedure in a user-friendly manner. Our framework allows practitioners to specify and solve robust ERM problems with a general class of convex losses, capturing many standard regression and classification problems. Users can easily specify any complex uncertainty set that is representable via disciplined convex programming (DCP) constraints.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability and Design of Sensor Feedback Amplifiers for Fast Stabilization of Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beam Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) model governing longitudinal oscillations in magnetizable piezoelectric beams exhibits exponentially stable solutions when subjected to two boundary state feedback controllers. An analytically established exponential decay rate by the Lyapunov approach ensures stabilization of the system to equilibrium, though the actual decay rate could potentially be improved. The decay rate of the closed-loop system is highly sensitive to the choice of material parameters and the design of the state feedback amplifiers. This paper focuses on investigating the design of state feedback amplifiers to achieve a maximal exponential decay rate, which is essential for effectively suppressing oscillations in these beams. Through this design process, we explicitly determine the safe intervals of feedback amplifiers that ensure the theoretically found maximal decay rate, with the potential for even better rates. Our numerical results reaffirm the robustness of the decay rate within the chosen range of feedback amplifiers, while deviations from this range significantly impact the decay rate. To underscore the validity of our results, we present various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Complexity analysis of regularization methods for implicitly constrained least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) naturally arise in scientific computing, as those constraints often model physical systems or the simulation thereof. In an implicitly constrained approach, the constraints are incorporated into the objective through a reduced formulation. To this end, a numerical procedure is typically applied to solve the constraint system, and efficient numerical routines with quantifiable cost have long been developed for that purpose. Meanwhile, the field of complexity in optimization, that estimates the cost of an optimization algorithm, has received significant attention in the literature, with most of the focus being on unconstrained or explicitly constrained problems.
  In this paper, we analyze an algorithmic framework based on quadratic regularization for implicitly constrained nonlinear least squares. By leveraging adjoint formulations, we can quantify the worst-case cost of our method to reach an approximate stationary point of the optimization problem. Our definition of such points exploits the least-squares structure of the objective, and provides new complexity insights even in the unconstrained setting. Numerical experiments conducted on PDE-constrained optimization problems demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method called affine facial reduction (FR) for recovering Slater's condition for semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Affine FR is a user-friendly method, as it is fully automatic and only requires a description of the problem. We provide a rigorous analysis of differences between affine FR and the existing methods. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of affine FR in reducing the size of SDP relaxations for CO problems.</description>

      <title>Using the Empirical Attainment Function for Analyzing Single-objective Black-box Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.</description>

      <title>Expected Time-Optimal Control: a Particle Model Predictive Control-based Approach via Sequential Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimum-time optimal control for a dynamical system with initial state uncertainties and propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) solution framework. We seek to minimize the expected terminal (mission) time, which is an essential capability for planetary exploration missions where ground rovers have to carry out scientific tasks efficiently within the mission timelines in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to convert the underlying stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic, numerically tractable, optimal control problem. To this end, the proposed solution framework combines two strategies from previous methods: i) a partial model predictive control with consensus horizon approach and ii) a sum-of-norm cost, a temporally strictly increasing weighted-norm, promoting minimum-time trajectories. Our contribution is to adopt these formulations into an SCP solution framework and obtain a numerically tractable stochastic control algorithm. We then demonstrate the resulting control method in multiple applications: i) a closed-loop linear system as a representative result (a spacecraft double integrator model), ii) an open-loop linear system (the same model), and then iii) a nonlinear system (Dubin's car).</description>

      <title>Stochastic Frank-Wolfe: Unified Analysis and Zoo of Special Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Conditional Gradient (or Frank-Wolfe) method is one of the most well-known methods for solving constrained optimization problems appearing in various machine learning tasks. The simplicity of iteration and applicability to many practical problems helped the method to gain popularity in the community. In recent years, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm received many different extensions, including stochastic modifications with variance reduction and coordinate sampling for training of huge models or distributed variants for big data problems. In this paper, we present a unified convergence analysis of the Stochastic Frank-Wolfe method that covers a large number of particular practical cases that may have completely different nature of stochasticity, intuitions and application areas. Our analysis is based on a key parametric assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients. But unlike most works on unified analysis of other methods, such as SGD, we do not assume an unbiasedness of the real gradient estimation. We conduct analysis for convex and non-convex problems due to the popularity of both cases in machine learning. With this general theoretical framework, we not only cover rates of many known methods, but also develop numerous new methods. This shows the flexibility of our approach in developing new algorithms based on the Conditional Gradient approach. We also demonstrate the properties of the new methods through numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Variational inequalities are a universal optimization paradigm that incorporate classical minimization and saddle point problems. Nowadays more and more tasks require to consider stochastic formulations of optimization problems. In this paper, we present an analysis of a method that gives optimal convergence estimates for monotone stochastic finite-sum variational inequalities. In contrast to the previous works, our method supports batching, does not lose the oracle complexity optimality and uses an arbitrary Bregman distance to take into account geometry of the problem. Paper provides experimental confirmation to algorithm's effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the random utility representation of best-worst choice probabilities (picking the best and the worst alternative from an offered set). Doignon (2023) presented a complete characterization of the best-worst-choice polytope on four alternatives. Moreover, using polytope methods he showed that the Block-Marschak inequalities for best-worst choices are not sufficient for a random utility representation of best-worst choices for sets of four or more alternatives. Following the approach of Falmagne (1978), we construct a probability measure on the set of rankings for a set of four alternatives implying a random utility representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on deriving some sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to non-monotone Variational Inequalities (VIs) based on inverse mapping theory. We have obtained several widely applicable sufficient conditions for this problem and have introduced a sufficient condition for the existence of a Minty solution. We have shown that the extra-gradient method converges to a solution of VI in the presence of a Minty solution. Additionally, we have shown that, under some extra assumption, the algorithm is efficient and approaches a particular type of Minty solution. Interpreting these results in an equivalent game theory problem, weak coupling conditions will be obtained, stating that if the players' cost functions are sufficiently weakly coupled, the game has a pure quasi-Nash equilibrium. Moreover, under the additional assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a pure Nash equilibrium exists for the corresponding game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the system identification problem for parameterized non-linear systems using basis functions under adversarial attacks. Motivated by the LASSO-type estimators, we analyze the exact recovery property of a non-smooth estimator, which is generated by solving an embedded $\ell_1$-loss minimization problem. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-specifiedness of the estimator and the uniqueness of global solutions to the underlying optimization problem. Next, we provide exact recovery guarantees for the estimator under two different scenarios of boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of the basis functions. The non-asymptotic exact recovery is guaranteed with high probability, even when there are more severely corrupted data than clean data. Finally, we numerically illustrate the validity of our theory. This is the first study on the sample complexity analysis of a non-smooth estimator for the non-linear system identification problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of wireless connectivity in urban areas around the globe, there remain numerous and diverse situations where connectivity is insufficient or unavailable. To address this, we introduce mobile wireless infrastructure on demand, a system of UAVs that can be rapidly deployed to establish an ad-hoc wireless network. This network has the capability of reconfiguring itself dynamically to satisfy and maintain the required quality of communication. The system optimizes the positions of the UAVs and the routing of data flows throughout the network to achieve this quality of service (QoS). By these means, task agents using the network simply request a desired QoS, and the system adapts accordingly while allowing them to move freely. We have validated this system both in simulation and in real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our system effectively offers mobile wireless infrastructure on demand, extending the operational range of task agents and supporting complex mobility patterns, all while ensuring connectivity and being resilient to agent failures.</description>

      <title>On Semidefinite Relaxations for Matrix-Weighted State-Estimation Problems in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the development of so-called certifiable perception methods, which leverage semidefinite, convex relaxations to find global optima of perception problems in robotics. However, many of these relaxations rely on simplifying assumptions that facilitate the problem formulation, such as an isotropic measurement noise distribution. In this paper, we explore the tightness of the semidefinite relaxations of matrix-weighted (anisotropic) state-estimation problems and reveal the limitations lurking therein: matrix-weighted factors can cause convex relaxations to lose tightness. In particular, we show that the semidefinite relaxations of localization problems with matrix weights may be tight only for low noise levels. To better understand this issue, we introduce a theoretical connection between the posterior uncertainty of the state estimate and the certificate matrix obtained via convex relaxation. With this connection in mind, we empirically explore the factors that contribute to this loss of tightness and demonstrate that redundant constraints can be used to regain it. As a second technical contribution of this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art relaxation of scalar-weighted SLAM cannot be used when matrix weights are considered. We provide an alternate formulation and show that its SDP relaxation is not tight (even for very low noise levels) unless specific redundant constraints are used. We demonstrate the tightness of our formulations on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical inverse problems are often studied in an ideal infinite-dimensional setting. The well-posedness theory provides a unique reconstruction of the parameter function, when an infinite amount of data is given. Through the lens of PDE-constrained optimization, this means one attains the zero-loss property of the mismatch function in this setting. This is no longer true in computations when we are limited to finite amount of measurements due to experimental or economical reasons. Consequently, one must compromise the goal, from inferring a function, to a discrete approximation.
  What is the reconstruction power of a fixed number of data observations? How many parameters can one reconstruct? Here we describe a probabilistic approach, and spell out the interplay of the observation size $(r)$ and the number of parameters to be uniquely identified $(m)$. The technical pillar here is the random sketching strategy, in which the matrix concentration inequality and sampling theory are largely employed. By analyzing a randomly subsampled Hessian matrix, we attain a well-conditioned reconstruction problem with high probability. Our main theory is validated in numerical experiments, using an elliptic inverse problem as an example.</description>

      <title>Causal Tracking of Distributions in Wasserstein Space: A Model Predictive Control Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of optimal swarm tracking which can be formulated as a tracking problem for distributions in the Wasserstein space. Optimal solutions to this problem are non-causal and require knowing the time-trajectory of the reference distribution in advance. We propose a scheme where these non-causal solutions can be used together with a predictive model for the reference to achieve causal tracking of a priori-unknown references. We develop a model-predictive control scheme built around the simple case where the reference is constant-in-time. A computational algorithm based on particle methods and discrete optimal mass transport is presented, and numerical simulations are provided for various classes of reference signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed control algorithm achieves reasonable performance even when using simple predictive models.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ESs, such as predator-prey dynamics. The stability of the equilibrium is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transient states.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Safety Alignment for Large Language Models via Optimal Dualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a dualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Local Methods with Adaptivity via Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and deep learning has introduced increasingly complex optimization challenges that must be addressed. Indeed, training modern, advanced models has become difficult to implement without leveraging multiple computing nodes in a distributed environment. Distributed optimization is also fundamental to emerging fields such as federated learning. Specifically, there is a need to organize the training process to minimize the time lost due to communication. A widely used and extensively researched technique to mitigate the communication bottleneck involves performing local training before communication. This approach is the focus of our paper. Concurrently, adaptive methods that incorporate scaling, notably led by Adam, have gained significant popularity in recent years. Therefore, this paper aims to merge the local training technique with the adaptive approach to develop efficient distributed learning methods. We consider the classical Local SGD method and enhance it with a scaling feature. A crucial aspect is that the scaling is described generically, allowing us to analyze various approaches, including Adam, RMSProp, and OASIS, in a unified manner. In addition to theoretical analysis, we validate the performance of our methods in practice by training a neural network.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on a cornerstone question in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a fixed membrane. We solve completely the problem in the plane for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms, which also includes the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of corresponding anisotropic extremizers (if they exist). Our approach is based on an isoanisotropic optimization formulation which, in turn, demands to be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies. A fine and detailed analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy leads to a central connection between shapes and fundamental frequencies of rather degenerate elliptic operators. Such a linking also permits to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. As a by-product, the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-Laplace operator is proved for any p other than 2.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamlitonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that quantum annealing admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Finding the Best Pure Nash Equilibrium in Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new integer programming game (IPG) named the Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) game and proposes a new algorithm, the Best Response Plus (BR-plus) algorithm, for finding the best Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE). We demonstrate this methodology by optimizing county-level decisions to prevent aquatic invasive species (AIS) in Minnesota lakes, where each county-level decision makers has self-serving objectives while AIS is an interconnected issue that crosses county borders. Specifically, we develop EBMC games to model the strategic interactions among county-level decision-makers with two variations in utility functions. We also study and prove the existence of a PNE in these models under specified conditions. We advance the current state-of-the-art, which is limited to only a few players, by presenting the BR-plus algorithm that can handle a large set of players via utilizing the best response dynamics for finding PNE in normal-form games. Experimental results show that our BR-plus algorithm offers computational advantages over the ZR algorithm, especially in larger games, on both random and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic, uncertain, societal-scale systems. In these settings, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often without knowledge of others' strategies. Designing decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remains challenging, especially beyond Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture the mixed cooperative-competitive nature of real-world interactions. Our paper focuses on designing decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria. We introduce a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF), and show that MNPF plays a central role in the analysis of convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning dynamics to approximate Nash equilibria. Our analysis leverages the two-timescale nature of actor-critic algorithms, where Q-function updates occur faster than policy updates. This result is further strengthened under certain regularity conditions and when the set of Nash equilibria is finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis of decentralized learning in multi-agent systems, addressing the complexities of real-world interactions.</description>

      <title>The nonholonomic Riemann and Weyl tensors for flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509399</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0509399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any manifold, any non-degenerate symmetric 2-form (metric) and any skew-symmetric (differential) form W can be reduced to a canonical form at any point, but not in any neighborhood: the respective obstructions being the Riemannian tensor and dW. The obstructions to flatness (to reducibility to a canonical form) are well-known for any G-structure, not only for Riemannian or symplectic structures.
  For the manifold with a nonholonomic structure (nonintegrable distribution), the general notions of flatness and obstructions to it, though of huge interest (e.g., in supergravity) were not known until recently, though particular cases were known for more than a century (e.g., any contact structure is ``flat'': it can always be reduced, locally, to a canonical form).
  We give a general definition of the NONHOLONOMIC analogs of the Riemann and Weyl tensors. With the help of Premet's theorems and a package SuperLie we calculate these tensors for the particular case of flag varieties associated with each maximal (and several other) parabolic subalgebra of each simple Lie algebra. We also compute obstructions to flatness of the G(2)-structure and its nonholonomic super counterpart.</description>
