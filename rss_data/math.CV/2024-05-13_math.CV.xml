      <title>A Le Potier-type isomorphism twisted with multiplier submodule sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a Le Potier-type isomorphism theorem twisted with multiplier submodule sheaves, which relates a holomorphic vector bundle endowed with a strongly Nakano semipositive singular Hermitian metric to the tautological line bundle with the induced metric. As applications, we obtain a Koll\'ar-type injectivity theorem, a Nadel-type vanishing theorem, and a singular holomorphic Morse inequality for holomorphic vector bundles and so on.</description>

      <title>Integral means spectrum functionals on Teichm\"uller spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals on Teichm\"uller spaces. We show that the IMS functionals on the closure of the universal Teichm\"uller space and on the asymptotic universal Teichm\"uller space are both continuous. During the proof, we obtain some new results about the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Analyticity theorems for parameter-dependent plurisubharmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that a union of upper-level sets associated to fibrewise Lelong numbers of plurisubharmonic functions is in general a pluripolar subset. Then we obtain analyticity theorems for a union of sub-level sets associated to fibrewise complex singularity exponents of some special (quasi-)plurisubharmonic functions. As a corollary, we confirm that, under certain conditions, the logarithmic poles of relative Bergman kernels form an analytic subset when the (quasi-)plurisubharmonic weight function has analytic singularities. In the end, we give counterexamples to show that the aforementioned sets are in general non-analytic even if the plurisubharmonic function is supposed to be continuous.</description>

      <title>Generalized de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the reproducing kernel $k$ of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_k$ we study spaces $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ whose reproducing kernel has the form $k(1-bb^*)$, where $b$ is a row-contraction on $\mathcal{H}_k$. In terms of reproducing kernels this it the most far-reaching generalization of the classical de Branges-Rovnyaks spaces, as well as their very recent generalization to several variables. This includes the so called sub-Bergman spaces in one or several variables. We study some general properties of $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ e.g. when the inclusion map into $\mathcal{H}$ is compact. Our main result provides a model for $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ reminiscent of the Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model for contractions. As an application we obtain sufficient conditions for the containment and density of the linear span of $\{k_w:w\in\mathcal{X}\}$ in $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$. In the standard cases this reduces to containment and density of polynomials. These methods resolve a very recent conjecture regarding polynomial approximation in spaces with kernel $\frac{(1-b(z)b(w)^*)^m}{(1-z\overline w)^\beta}, 1\leq m&lt;\beta, m\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Commutation relations for two-sided radial SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,4]$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) which satisfies the resampling property. We define it by weighting two independent radial SLEs by a two-time parameter martingale. However, unlike in the chordal case, the resampling property does not uniquely determine the pair due to the additional degree of freedom in the spiraling rate. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence and smoothness of the Navier-Stokes Equation for viscosity large enough which after rescaling implies a solution for any positive viscosity, additionally, we show the existence of a curve of entire vector fields of order 2 that extends the solution to the complex domain for positive time.</description>

Abstract: We pose a normal form of transition functions along some Levi-flat hypersurfaces obtained by suspension. By focusing on methods in circle dynamics and linearization theorems, we give a sufficient condition to obtain a normal form as a geometrical analogue of Arnol'd's linearization theorem.</description>

      <title>Some interesting birational morphisms of smooth affine quadric $3$-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of birational maps of smooth affine quadric 3-folds, {over the complex numbers}, of the form $x_1x_4-x_2x_3=$ constant, which seems to have some (among many others) interesting/unexpected characters: a) they are cohomologically hyperbolic, b) their second dynamical degree is an algebraic number but not an algebraic integer, and c) the logarithmic growth of their periodic points is strictly smaller than their algebraic entropy. These maps are restrictions of a polynomial map on $\mathbb{C}^4$ preserving each of the quadrics. The study in this paper is a mixture of rigorous and experimental ones, where for the experimental study we rely on Bertini which is a reliable and fast software for expensive numerical calculations in complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Karpelevic theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statement of the Karpelevic theorem concerning the location of the eigenvalues of stochastic matrices in the complex plane (known as the Karpelevic region) is long and complicated and his proof methods are, at best, nebulous. Fortunately, an elegant simplification of the statement was provided by Ito -- in particular, Ito's theorem asserts that the boundary of the Karpelevic region consists of arcs whose points satisfy a polynomial equation that depends on the endpoints of the arc. Unfortunately, Ito did not prove his version and only showed that it is equivalent.
  More recently, Johnson and Paparella showed that points satisfying Ito's equation belong to the Karpelevic region. Although not the intent of their work, this initiated the process of proving Ito's theorem and hence the Karpelevic theorem.
  The purpose of this work is to continue this effort by showing that an arc appears in the prescribed sector. To this end, it is shown that there is a continuous function $\lambda:[0,1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that $\mathsf{P}^\mathsf{I}(\lambda(\alpha)) = 0$, $\forall \alpha \in [0,1]$, where $\mathsf{P}^\mathsf{I}$ is a Type I reduced Ito polynomial. It is also shown that these arcs are simple. Finally, an elementary argument is given to show that points on the boundary of the Karpelevic region are extremal whenever $n &gt; 3$.</description>

      <title>Wetzel families and the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide answers to a question brought up by Erd\H{o}s about the construction of Wetzel families in the absence of the continuum hypothesis - a Wetzel family is a family $\mathcal{F}$ of entire functions on the complex plane which pointwise assumes fewer than $\vert \mathcal{F} \vert$ values. To be more precise, we show that the existence of a Wetzel family is consistent with all possible values $\kappa$ of the continuum and, if $\kappa$ is regular, also with Martin's Axiom. In the particular case of $\kappa = \aleph_2$ this answers an open question asked by Kumar and Shelah. In the buildup to this result, we are also solving an open question of Zapletal on strongly almost disjoint functions. We also study a strongly related notion of sets exhibiting a universality property via mappings by entire functions and show that these consistently exist while the continuum equals $\aleph_2$.</description>
