      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of NiCoMn MOFs for Wastewater Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water pollution has become a global problem. Sources of wastewater majorly include industrial and commercial sectors. To cater to the exponential increase in clean water, efficient technologies are needed to treat wastewater. Several techniques such as redox reactions, membrane filtrations, mechanical processes, chemical treatment and adsorption techniques have been employed. However, their cost and effectiveness is still a major problem. In this study, we employed an effective wastewater treatment technique by synthesizing NiCoMn MOFs using a simple hydrothermal technique and characterized the properties using XRD and SEM for their possible characteristics. XRD analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of NiCoMn MOFs. Sufficient information regarding the surface morphology and topology was given by the SEM analysis which proved a nanoporous structure with high surface area effective for adsorption and oxidative catalysis of contaminants in wastewater. Moreover, a high electrostatic attraction between the MOFs was observed which could attract oppositely charged contaminants. The results showed a high potential for the synthesized NiCoMn MOFs for wastewater treatment applications.</description>

      <title>Nutmeg and SPICE: Models and Data for Biomolecular Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe version 2 of the SPICE dataset, a collection of quantum chemistry calculations for training machine learning potentials. It expands on the original dataset by adding much more sampling of chemical space and more data on non-covalent interactions. We train a set of potential energy functions called Nutmeg on it. They use a novel mechanism to improve performance on charged and polar molecules, injecting precomputed partial charges into the model to provide a reference for the large scale charge distribution. Evaluation of the new models shows they do an excellent job of reproducing energy differences between conformations, even on highly charged molecules or ones that are significantly larger than the molecules in the training set. They also produce stable molecular dynamics trajectories, and are fast enough to be useful for routine simulation of small molecules.</description>

      <title>Towards the optimization of a perovskite-based room temperature ozone sensor: A multifaceted approach in pursuit of sensitivity, stability, and understanding of mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted significant attention owing to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, vital for sensor performance, are still unexclusive. This work presents the first evaluation of the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs, considering factors such as halide composition variation and Mn doping levels. The research reveals a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior, with Br-rich sensors displaying a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibit an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhances the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process, as supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation of the sensors provides valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors, highlighting the impact of dynamic instabilities over time. Overall, this research offers insights into optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels, representing a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable, marking a new era in sensor technology.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Catalytic Mechanism of Molybdenum Cofactors: A Novel Coupled Cluster Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use modern electronic structure methods to model the catalytic mechanism of different variants of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). We investigate the dependence of various Moco model systems on structural relaxation and the importance of environmental effects for five critical points along the reaction coordinate with the DMSO and NO$_3^-$ substrates. Furthermore, we scrutinize the performance of various coupled-cluster approaches for modeling the relative energies along the investigated reaction paths, focusing on several pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) flavors and conventional coupled cluster approximations. Moreover, we elucidate the Mo--O bond formation using orbital-based quantum information measures, which highlight the flow of $\sigma_{\rm M-O}$ bond formation and $\sigma_{\rm N/S-O}$ bond breaking. Our study shows that pCCD-based models are a viable alternative to conventional methods and offer us unique insights into the bonding situation along a reaction coordinate. Finally, this work highlights the importance of environmental effects or changes in the core and, consequently, in the model itself to elucidate the change in activity of different Moco variants.</description>

      <title>CheMFi: A Multifidelity Dataset of Quantum Chemical Properties of Diverse Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and conventional Quantum Chemistry (QC) computational methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties ranging from atomization energies to excitation energies. Various datasets such as MD17, MD22, and WS22, which consist of properties calculated at some level of QC method, or fidelity, have been generated to benchmark such ML models. The term fidelity refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method to the actual real value of the property. The higher the fidelity, the more accurate the calculated property, albeit at a higher computational cost.
  Research in multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where ML models are trained on data from more than one numerical QC method, has shown the effectiveness of such models over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. A major hurdle for effective research in this field of research in the community is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking.
  Here, we present a comprehensive multifidelity dataset drawn from the WS22 molecular conformations. We provide the quantum Chemistry MultiFidelity (CheMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice and are namely: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. CheMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties including vertical excitation energies, oscillator strengths, molecular dipole moments, and ground state energies. In addition to the dataset, multifidelity benchmarks are set with state-of-the-art MFML and optimized-MFML</description>

      <title>$\nabla^2$DFT: A Universal Quantum Chemistry Dataset of Drug-Like Molecules and a Benchmark for Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</description>

      <title>Human-level molecular optimization driven by mol-gene evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De novo molecule generation allows the search for more drug-like hits across a vast chemical space. However, lead optimization is still required, and the process of optimizing molecular structures faces the challenge of balancing structural novelty with pharmacological properties. This study introduces the Deep Genetic Molecular Modification Algorithm (DGMM), which brings structure modification to the level of medicinal chemists. A discrete variational autoencoder (D-VAE) is used in DGMM to encode molecules as quantization code, mol-gene, which incorporates deep learning into genetic algorithms for flexible structural optimization. The mol-gene allows for the discovery of pharmacologically similar but structurally distinct compounds, and reveals the trade-offs of structural optimization in drug discovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DGMM in several applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding active learning of molecular docking and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancing capabilities of computational methodologies and resources, ultra-large-scale virtual screening via molecular docking has emerged as a prominent strategy for in silico hit discovery. Given the exhaustive nature of ultra-large-scale virtual screening, active learning methodologies have garnered attention as a means to mitigate computational cost through iterative small-scale docking and machine learning model training. While the efficacy of active learning methodologies has been empirically validated in extant literature, a critical investigation remains in how surrogate models can predict docking score without considering three-dimensional structural features, such as receptor conformation and binding poses. In this paper, we thus investigate how active learning methodologies effectively predict docking scores using only 2D structures and under what circumstances they may work particularly well through benchmark studies encompassing six receptor targets. Our findings suggest that surrogate models tend to memorize structural patterns prevalent in high docking scored compounds obtained during acquisition steps. Despite this tendency, surrogate models demonstrate utility in virtual screening, as exemplified in the identification of actives from DUD-E dataset and high docking-scored compounds from EnamineReal library, a significantly larger set than the initial screening pool. Our comprehensive analysis underscores the reliability and potential applicability of active learning methodologies in virtual screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Floquet perspective on high harmonic generation and above threshold ionization spectra from Photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof based on non-hermitian Floquet theory that confirms the experimental findings of Tsatrafylis and his colleagues in 2017, demonstrating the coincidence between the high harmonic generation spectra (HGS) and the number of absorbed odd infrared (IR) photons leading to emitted extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation. This coincidence is achieved through post-selection of the IR photons, conserving the total energy of the absorbed odd IR photons and the emitted XUV photons. Our derivation is consistent with their results and relies on our ability to compute the HGS in ultra-high-intensity lasers using non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM), which competes with above-threshold ionization (ATI). Through our NHQM theoretical simulation, we identify the regimes where there is correspondence between the HHG and ATI spectra and annihilated pump photons (with post-selection). Additionally, we demonstrate that the photon statistics in HHG exhibit Wigner-type distributions, which reflect the quantum chaotic dynamics of electrons at the cutoff of the plateau of the HGS. We emphasize that our findings underscore a unified mechanism governing the three distinct measurements of HGS, ATI, and IR photon number distribution, none of which require the quantization of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>PRESTO: Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic Chemistry Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen growing adoption across various scientific disciplines. These advancements encourage the investigation of molecule-text modeling within synthetic chemistry, a field dedicated to designing and conducting chemical reactions to synthesize new compounds with desired properties and applications. Current approaches, however, often neglect the critical role of multiple molecule graph interaction in understanding chemical reactions, leading to suboptimal performance in synthetic chemistry tasks. This study introduces PRESTO(Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic Chemistry Outcomes), a new framework that bridges the molecule-text modality gap by integrating a comprehensive benchmark of pretraining strategies and dataset configurations. It progressively improves multimodal LLMs through cross-modal alignment and multi-graph understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PRESTO offers competitive results in downstream synthetic chemistry tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/IDEA-XL/PRESTO.</description>

      <title>Managing Temperature in Open Quantum Systems Strongly Coupled with Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-perturbative non-Markovian open quantum systems, reaching either low temperatures with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) or high temperatures with the Thermalized Time Evolving Density Operator with Orthogonal Polynomials (T-TEDOPA) formalism in Hilbert space remains challenging. We compare different manners of modeling the environment. Sampling the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, also called temperature dependent spectral density, proves to be very effective. T-TEDOPA (Tamascelli et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 090402 (2019)) uses a linear chain of oscillators with positive and negative frequencies while HEOM is based on the complex poles of an optimized rational decomposition of the temperature dependent spectral density (Xu et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 230601 (2022)). Resorting to the poles of the temperature independent spectral density and of the Bose function separately is an alternative when the problem due to the huge number of the Bose poles at low temperature is circumvented. Two examples illustrate the effectiveness of the HEOM and T-TEDOPA approaches: a benchmark pure dephasing case and a two-bath model simulating dynamics of excited electronic states coupled through a conical intersection. We show the efficiency of T-TEDOPA to simulate dynamics at a finite temperature by using either continuous spectral densities or only all the intramolecular oscillators of a linear vibronic model calibrated from ab initio data of a phenylene ethynylene dimer.</description>

      <title>Observation of full contrast icosahedral Bose-Einstein statistics in laser desorbed, buffer gas cooled C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical nature of spherical top molecules is particularly evident at low angular momentum quantum number J. Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Nano-Patterned Pt-Based Metallic Glass Electrocatalysts with In-Situ Copper Oxide Foam for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for replacing fossil fuels, and hydrogen production via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an environmentally friendly option if electrocatalysts with low overpotentials and long-term stability are used. In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of $\mathrm{Pt_{57.5}Cu_{14.7}Ni_{5.3}P_{22.5}}$ bulk metallic glass (BMG) with flat, micro-patterned, and nano-patterned surfaces for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 is studied. The nano-patterned Pt-BMG demonstrates outstanding long-term stability and self-improving behavior with a final overpotential of 150 mV and a Tafel slope of 42 $\mathrm{mV dec^{-1}}$ after 1000 linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) cycles, which is respectively 42% and 37% lower than in the first LSV cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) indicate the formation of a layer of CuO/Cu2O foam deposited on top of the nano-patterned surface during the stability test of 1000 LSV cycles. A three-step process is proposed to explain the formation of CuxO foam via dynamic hydrogen bubble templating (DHBT) electrodeposition from Cu dissolution of the Pt-BMG without using copper salt. This work provides a method to create CuxO foams that could be used for various applications. Moreover, nano-patterned BMGs with DHBT deposition offer a feasible strategy to synthesize metal or metal-oxide foams.</description>

      <title>Achieving Cooling Without Repump Lasers Through Ion Motional Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling typically requires one or more repump lasers to clear dark states and enable recycling transitions. Here, we have achieved cooling of Be+ ions using a single laser beam, facilitated by one-dimensional heating through micromotion. By manipulating the displacement from the trap's nodal line, we precisely controlled the ion micromotion direction and speed, reaching up to 3144 m/s, which corresponds to a 7.1 GHz Doppler frequency shift in our experiment. This approach eliminates the necessity of a 1.25 GHz offset repump laser while keeping the Be+ ions cold in the perpendicular direction. Measurements were taken using cooling laser detuning and imaging of ion trajectories. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on machine learned time-dependent electric field E(X, Y, Z, t) inside the trap, accurately reproduced the experimental observation, illuminating the relationship between the direction of micromotion and the trapping electric filed vector. This work not only provides a robust method for managing the micromotion velocity of ions but also sheds light on laser cooling complex systems that require multiple repumping lasers. Additionally, it offers a method for controlling energy in the context of ion-molecule collision investigations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring together the advantages of terahertz (THz) and optical spectroscopies to introduce TACOS (Terahertz-Assisted Chiro-Optical Spectroscopy), a novel approach for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality and control over chiral electronic dynamics. We show how, using a THz pulse, we can induce a transient electronic orientation in a medium of randomly oriented chiral molecules that breaks the isotropy of the molecular sample. This symmetry breaking twists the nonlinear response of the medium to an ultrashort linearly polarised optical pulse in a highly enantiosensitive manner. As a result, the medium emits elliptically polarised light at new optical frequencies that records the molecular handedness via purely electric-dipole interactions. The long wavelength and period of the THz pulse enable both spatial coherence across the sample and a substantial degree of electronic orientation over the duration of the ultrashort optical pulse. TACOS does not require optical carrier-envelope phase stability or working in vacuum, and it creates exciting avenues for ultrafast and highly efficient chiral sensing and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Transferable Boltzmann Generators</title>

Abstract: The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</description>

      <title>My Understanding for Static and Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results obtained using my computing program are consistent with the values obtained twenty years ago. It also makes me believe that how to obtain particle size information using the Light Scattering technique needs to be reconsidered.
  Static Light Scattering (SLS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) are very important techniques to study the characteristics of nano-particles in dispersion. The data of SLS is determined by the optical characteristic and the measured values of DLS are determined by optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of different size nano-particles in dispersion. Then considering the optical characteristic of nano-particles and using the SLS technique further, the size distribution can be measured accurately and is also consistent with the results measured using the TEM technique. Based on the size distribution obtained using the SLS or TEM technique and the relation between the static and hydrodynamic radii, all the expected and measured values of $g^{\left( 2\right) }\left( \tau \right) $ investigated are very well consistent. Since the data measured using the DLS technique contains the information of the optical and hydrodynamic properties of nano-particles together, therefore the accurate size distribution cannot be obtained from the experimental data of
  $g^{\left( 2\right) }\left( \tau \right) $ for an unknown sample. The traditional particle information: apparent hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity index measured using the DLS technique are determined by the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics and size distribution together. They cannot represent a number distribution of nano-particles in dispersion. Using the light scattering technique not only can measure the size distribution accurately but also can provide a method to understand the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of nano-particles.</description>

      <title>Learning Collective Variables with Synthetic Data Augmentation through Physics-inspired Geodesic Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, are typically studied using enhanced sampling techniques, most of which are based on the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which acceleration occurs. Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lack of information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfolded to folded conformation. We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategy using physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resembling protein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without true transition state samples. This new data can be used to improve the accuracy of classifier-based methods. Alternatively, a regression-based learning scheme for CV models can be adopted by leveraging the interpolation progress parameter.</description>

      <title>Relativistic coupled cluster with completely renormalized and perturbative triples corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have implemented noniterative triples corrections to the energy from coupled-cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) within the 1-electron exact two-component (1eX2C) relativistic framework. The effectiveness of both the CCSD(T) and the completely renormalized (CR) CC(2,3) approaches are demonstrated by performing all-electron computations of the potential energy curves and spectroscopic constants of copper, silver, and gold dimers in their ground electronic states. Spin-orbit coupling effects captured via the 1eX2C framework are shown to be crucial for recovering the correct shape of the potential energy curves, and the correlation effects due to triples in these systems changes the dissociation energies by about 0.1--0.2 eV or about 4--7\%. We also demonstrate that relativistic effects and basis set size and contraction scheme are significantly more important in Au$_2$ than in Ag$_2$ or Cu$_2$.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory for Non-Perturbative Dynamics: The Rabi Oscillation Problem Resolved</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations have long been thought to be out of reach in simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), a prominent symptom of the failure of the adiabatic approximation for non-perturbative dynamics. We present a reformulation of TDDFT which requires response quantities only, thus enabling an adiabatic approximation to predict such dynamics accurately because the functional is evaluated on a density close to the ground-state, instead of on the fully non-perturbative density. Our reformulation applies to it any real-time dynamics, redeeming TDDFT far from equilibrium. Examples of a resonantly-driven local excitation in a model He atom, and charge-transfer in the LiCN molecule are given.</description>

      <title>No more gap-shifting: Stochastic many-body-theory based TDHF for accurate theory of polymethine cyanine dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an individually fitted screened-exchange interaction for the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method and show that it resolves the missing binding energies in polymethine organic dye molecules compared to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The interaction kernel, which can be thought as a dielectric function, is generated by stochastic fitting to the screened-Coulomb interaction of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), specific to each system. We test our method on the flavylium (Flav) and indocyanine green (ICG) dye families with a modifiable length of the polymethine bridge, leading to excitations ranging from the visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR). Our approach validates earlier observations on the importance of inclusion of medium range exchange for the exciton binding energy. Our resulting method, TDHF@$v_W$, also achieves a mean absolute error on par with MBPT at a computational cost on par with local-functional TDDFT.</description>

      <title>Right On Time: Ultrafast Charge Separation Before Hybrid Exciton Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic/inorganic hybrid systems offer great potential for novel solar cell design combining the tunability of organic chromophore absorption properties with high charge carrier mobilities of inorganic semiconductors. However, often such material combinations do not show the expected performance: while ZnO, for example, basically exhibits all necessary properties for a successful application in light-harvesting, it was clearly outpaced by TiO$_2$ in terms of charge separation efficiency. The origin of this deficiency has long been debated. This study employs femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and many-body ab initio calculations to identify and quantify all elementary steps leading to the suppression of charge separation at an exemplary organic/ZnO interface. We demonstrate that charge separation indeed occurs efficiently on ultrafast (350 fs) timescales, but that electrons are recaptured at the interface on a 100 ps timescale and subsequently trapped in a strongly bound (0.7 eV) hybrid exciton state with a lifetime exceeding 5 $\mu$s. Thus, initially successful charge separation is followed by delayed electron capture at the interface, leading to apparently low charge separation efficiencies. This finding provides a sufficiently large timeframe for counter-measures in device design to successfully implement specifically ZnO and, moreover, invites material scientists to revisit charge separation in various kinds of previously discarded hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Pretraining Strategy for Neural Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mask pretraining method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their performance on fitting potential energy surfaces, particularly in water systems. GNNs are pretrained by recovering spatial information related to masked-out atoms from molecules, then transferred and finetuned on atomic forcefields. Through such pretraining, GNNs learn meaningful prior about structural and underlying physical information of molecule systems that are useful for downstream tasks. From comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and convergence speed compared to GNNs trained from scratch or using other pretraining techniques such as denoising. On the other hand, our pretraining method is suitable for both energy-centric and force-centric GNNs. This approach showcases its potential to enhance the performance and data efficiency of GNNs in fitting molecular force fields.</description>

      <title>Assessing exchange-correlation functionals for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing interest in sustainable synthesis of ammonia, nitrates, and urea has led to an increase in studies of catalytic conversion between nitrogen-containing compounds using heterogeneous catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly employed to obtain molecular-scale insight into these reactions, but there have been relatively few assessments of the exchange-correlation functionals that are best suited for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen compounds. Here, we assess a range of functionals ranging from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the random phase approximation (RPA) for the formation energies of gas-phase nitrogen species, the lattice constants of representative solids from several common classes of catalysts (metals, oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), and the adsorption energies of a range of nitrogen-containing intermediates on these materials. The results reveal that the choice of exchange-correlation functional and van der Waals correction can have a surprisingly large effect and that increasing the level of theory does not always improve the accuracy for nitrogen-containing compounds. This suggests that the selection of functionals should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the specific reaction and material being studied.</description>

      <title>Realized Stable BP-N at Ambient Pressure by Phosphorus Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black phosphorus nitrogen (BP-N) is an attractive high-energy-density material. However, high-pressure synthesized BP-N will decompose at low-pressure and cannot be quenched to ambient conditions. Finding a method to stabilize it at 0 GPa is of great significance for its practical applications. However, unlike cg-N, LP-N, and HLP-N, it is always a metastable phase at high-pressure up to 260 GPa, and decomposes into chains at 23 GPa. Here, based on the first-principles simulations, we find that P atom doping can effectively reduce the synthesis pressure of BP-N and maintain its stability at 0 GPa. Uniform distribution of P atom dopants within the layer helps maintain the structural stability of BP-N layer at 0 GPa, while interlayer electrostatic interaction induced by N-P dipoles enhances its dynamic stability by eliminating interlayer slipping. Furthermore, pressure is conducive to enhancing the stability of BP-N and its doped forms by suppressing N-chain dissociation. For the configuration with 12.5% doping concentration, a gravimetric energy density of 8.07 kJ/g can be realized, which is nearly two times higher than TNT.</description>
