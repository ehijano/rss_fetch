      <title>Quadratic forms of signature $(2, 2)$ or $(3, 1)$ I: effective equidistribution in quotients of $\mathrm{SL}_4(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of horospherical subgroups of $\mathrm{SO}(2, 2)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(3, 1)$ in quotients of $\mathrm{SL}_4(\mathbb{R})$ with a polynomial error term. In a forthcoming paper, we will use this theorem to prove an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms of signature $(2, 2)$ or $(3, 1)$ with a polynomial error rate.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of n-centre billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of mechanical billiards, where a particle moves in a planar region under the influence of an n-centre potential and reflects elastically on a straight wall. Motivated by Boltzmann's original billiard model we explore when such systems fail to be integrable. We show that for any positive energy, if there are at least two centres and the wall is placed sufficiently far away, the billiard dynamics is necessarily non-integrable and exhibits chaotic behaviour. In the classical Newtonian two-centre problem, we identify a simple geometric condition on the wall that likewise guarantees chaos, even though the free two-centre system is integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{P}^{1}_{an}$ be the Berkovich projective line over a complete, algebraically closed, non-Archimedean field of characteristic $0$. Let $\phi$ be a degree $\geq 2$ rational map with potential good reduction, acting on $\mathbb{P}^{1}_{an}$. In this article, we give an easily verifiable equivalent criterion for the fixed point locus of $\phi$ to be connected. We also give an equivalent criterion for the fixed point locus of $\phi$ to be finite. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for the number of connected components of the fixed point locus of a rational map with potential good reduction.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the geometric structure and multiple timescales of the urea-urease pH oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-variable dynamical system modeling pH oscillations in the urea-urease reaction within giant lipid vesicles -- a problem that intrinsically contains multiple, well-separated timescales. Building on an existing, deterministic formulation via ordinary differential equations, we resolve different orders of magnitude within a small parameter and analyze the system's limit cycle behavior using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). By introducing two different coordinate scalings -- each valid in a distinct region of the phase space -- we resolve the local dynamics near critical fold points, using the extension of GSPT through such singular points due to Krupa and Szmolyan. This framework enables a geometric decomposition of the periodic orbits into slow and fast segments and yields closed-form estimates for the period of oscillation. In particular, we link the existence of such oscillations to an underlying biochemical asymmetry, namely, the differential transport across the vesicle membrane.</description>

      <title>A new condition for the genericity of ergodic measures on non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the genericity of ergodic probability measures for the geodesic flow on non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. We demonstrate that the existence of an open isometric embedding of a product manifold with a factor isometric to $S^1$ implies that the closure of the set of ergodic measures does not encompass all invariant measures, thus the genericity of ergodic probability measures fails. Our findings notably provide an answer to an open question concerning a specific example of 3-manifold attributed to Heintze.</description>

      <title>Construction and Characterization of Oscillatory Chain Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates a theoretical investigation of $\frac{1}{4}$-oscillatory chain sequences $\{a_n\}$, generalizing Szwarc's classical framework for non-oscillatory chains \cite{Sz94, Sz98, Sz02, Sz03} to sequences fluctuating around $\frac{1}{4}$. We prove the existence of a fixed point for the critical map $f(x)=1-\frac{1}{4x}$ and establish convergence properties linking oscillatory behavior to parameter sequences $\{g_n\}$. A complete characterization is provided via a necessary and sufficient condition, exemplified by explicit solutions $a_n=\frac{1}{4}\left(1+(-1)^{n}\varepsilon_{n}\right)$. Crucially, we construct oscillatory chain sequences for which the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(a_n - \frac{1}{4}\right)$ diverges, thus violating Chihara's conjectured bound.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the exponential separation and dimension preserving approximation for sets and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dimension theory of sets and measures, a recent breakthrough happened due to Hochman, who introduced the exponential separation condition and proved the Hausdorff dimension result for invariant sets and measures generated by similarities on the real line. Following this groundbreaking work, we make a modest contribution by weakening the condition. We also define some sets in the class of all nonempty compact sets using the Assouad and Hausdorff dimensions and subsets of measures in the Borel probability measures using the $L^q$ dimension and prove their density in the respective spaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dynamics of a Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Model with Toxin-Mediated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a discrete phytoplankton-zooplankton model incorporating Holling type~III predation and Holling type~II toxin release. The existence and stability of positive fixed points are analyzed, and it is shown that when two such points, $E_1$ and $E_2$, exist, $E_2$ is always a saddle. A Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at $E_1$ is verified using the normal form method, indicating the emergence of closed invariant curves. This bifurcation implies that phytoplankton and zooplankton populations may exhibit sustained periodic oscillations, which could correspond to natural plankton bloom cycles. The global stability of the boundary equilibrium $(1,0)$ is also established. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Computability for Axiom A Polynomial Skew Products of $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computability of Julia sets of rational maps on the Riemann sphere has been intensively studied in recent years (see, e.g. https://doi.org/10.17323/1609-4514-2008-8-2-185-231, https://doi.org/10.1090/conm/797/15936) for an overview. For example, by Braverman's results (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.06.031, https://doi.org/10.1088/0951-7715/19/6/009), hyperbolic and parabolic Julia sets are computable in polynomial time. In this paper, we present the first work on computability related to maps of more than one complex dimension.
  We examine a family of polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$, the polynomial skew products; i.e., maps of the form
  $f(z,w) = (p(z), q(z,w)),$
  where $p$ and $q$ are complex polynomials of the same degree $d\geq 2$.
  We show that if a polynomial skew product is Axiom A, then its chain recurrent set, which is equal to its non-wandering set and also equal to the closure of the periodic orbits, is computable. Our algorithm also identifies the various hyperbolic sets of different types, i.e., expanding, attracting, and hyperbolic sets of saddle-type.
  One consequence of our results is that Axiom A is a semi-decidable property on the closure of the Axiom A polynomial skew product locus. Finally, we introduce an algorithm that establishes the lower semi-computability of the hyperbolicity locus of polynomial skew products of a fixed degree.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical analysis of spillover effects in prioritized PrEP for HIV prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective intervention for preventing HIV transmission, but its high cost and uneven uptake raise challenges. While spillover effects - wherein PrEP use in one group reduces infections in others - are known to occur, they remain poorly quantified and rarely guide policy. We develop and analyze a novel compartmental HIV model that stratifies the population into three interacting subgroups: heterosexual males (HETM), heterosexual females (HETF), and men who have sex with men (MSM). We derive standard results, including the control reproduction number, and establish conditions for local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. We provide a closed-form, time-resolved expression for the spillover-adjusted number needed to treat (NNT), a measure of the population-level impact of PrEP uptake in one group on incidence in others. Simulations calibrated to Georgia state-level data reveal that PrEP delivery to MSM yields substantial indirect benefits, particularly for HETF, where the spillover effect exceeds the direct effect by a factor of five. We extend the baseline model to include risk stratification within HETF, showing that targeting high-risk HETF outperforms direct PrEP delivery to HETM, emphasizing the importance of intra-group heterogeneity. To evaluate whether these findings persist under more detailed assumptions, we embed our framework into the national HOPE model maintained by the CDC and conduct global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices. This approach extends our analytical insights and quantifies how uncertainty in PrEP allocation strategies propagates through complex dynamics. Our results show that moderately complex, analytically tractable models can yield realistic and actionable guidance for HIV control-capturing nonlinear spillover dynamics in ways that remain interpretable even in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Variational Construction of Homoclinic and Heteroclinic Orbits in the Planar Sitnikov Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sitnikov problem is a special case of the three-body problem. The system is known to be chaotic and has been studied by symbolic dynamics (J. Moser, Stable and random motions in dynamical systems, Princeton University Press, 1973). We study the limiting case of the Sitnikov problem as the eccentricity of the massive particles tends to 1. By variational method, we show the existence of infinitely many homoclinic and heteroclinic solutions in the planar Sitnikov problem. In a previous work, for certain periodic symbolic sequences, the second author showed the existence of periodic solutions realizing them. In this paper, we show the existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic solutions between some of these periodic orbits which realize certain non-periodic symbolic sequences.</description>

      <title>A Score-based Diffusion Model Approach for Adaptive Learning of Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting. SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and noisy observations.</description>

      <title>Logically Contractive Mappings: Fixed Points and Event-Indexed Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "logically contractive mappings" nonexpansive self-maps that contract along a subsequence of iterates and prove a fixed-point theorem that extends Banach's principle. We obtain event-indexed convergence rates and, under bounded gaps between events, explicit iteration-count rates. A worked example shows a nonexpansive map whose square is a strict contraction, and we clarify relations to Meir--Keeler and asymptotically nonexpansive mappings. We further generalize to variable-factor events and show that $\prod_k \lambda_k = 0$ (equivalently $\sum_k -\ln \lambda_k = \infty$) implies convergence. These results unify several generalized contraction phenomena and suggest new rate questions tied to event sparsity.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics in time-delay systems: polynomial $\beta$-control in a pressing process and connections to blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a press control problem in straightening machines with small time delays due to system communication. To handle this, we propose a generalized $\beta$-control method, which replaces conventional linear velocity control with a polynomial of degree $\beta \ge 1$. The resulting model is a delay differential equation (DDE), for which we derive basic properties through nondimensionalization and analysis. Numerical experiments suggest the existence of a threshold initial velocity separating overshoot and non-overshoot dynamics, which we formulate as a conjecture. Based on this, we design a control algorithm under velocity constraints and confirm its effectiveness. We also highlight a connection between threshold behavior and finite-time blow-up in DDEs. This study provides a practical control strategy and contributes new insights into threshold dynamics and blow-up phenomena in delay systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the behavior of randomized coordinate gradient descent for nonconvex optimization, proving that under standard assumptions, the iterates almost surely escape strict saddle points. By formulating the method as a nonlinear random dynamical system and characterizing neighborhoods of critical points, we establish this result through the center-stable manifold theorem.</description>

Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models. Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment. Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the manifold hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics learning with state-space systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property (ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality, stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey paper about the fractal percolation process, also known as Mandelbrot percolation. It is intended to give a general breadth overview of more recent research in the topic, but also includes some of the more classical results, for example related to the connectivity properties. Particular emphasis is put on the dimension theory of the limiting set and also on the geometry of the non-trivial connected components in the supercritical regime. In particular, we show that both the Assouad spectrum and intermediate dimensions of the non-trivial connected components are constant equal to its box dimension despite its Hausdorff, box and Assouad dimensions known to being distinct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a noncompact semisimple algebraic group with trivial center, $S &lt; G$ a maximal split torus, $H &lt; G$ the centralizer of $S$ in $G$ and $\Gamma &lt; G$ an irreducible lattice. Consider the group measure space von Neumann algebra $\mathscr M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H)$ associated with the nonsingular action $\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H$ and regard the group von Neumann algebra $M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma)$ as a von Neumann subalgebra $M \subset \mathscr M$. We show that the group $\operatorname{Aut}_M(\mathscr M)$ of all unital normal $\ast$-automorphisms of $\mathscr M$ acting identically on $M$ is isomorphic to the Weyl group $\mathscr W_G$ of the semisimple algebraic group $G$. Our main theorem is a noncommutative analogue of a rigidity result of Bader-Furman-Gorodnik-Weiss for group actions on algebraic homogeneous spaces and moreover gives new insight towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives a topological characterization of Hamiltonian flows with finitely many singular points on compact surfaces, using the concept of ``demi-caract\'eristique'' in the sense of Poincar\'e. Furthermore, we describe the relationships and distinctions among the Hamiltonian, divergence-free, and non-wandering properties for continuous flows, which gives an affirmative answer to the problem posed by Nikolaev and Zhuzhoma under the assumption of finitely many singular points.</description>

      <title>Generic alignment conjecture for systems of Cucker-Smale type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generic alignment conjecture states that for almost every initial data on the torus solutions to the Cucker-Smale system with a strictly local communication align to the common mean velocity. In this note we present a partial resolution of this conjecture using a statistical mechanics approach. First, the conjecture holds in full for the sticky particle model representing, formally, infinitely strong local communication. In the classical case the conjecture is proved when $N$, the number of agents, is equal to $2$. It follows from a more general result stating that for a system of any size for almost every data at least two agents align.
  The analysis is extended to the open space $\R^n$ in the presence of confinement and potential interaction forces. In particular, it is shown that almost every non-oscillatory pair of solutions aligns and aggregates in the potential well.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameterisation: the importance of nonlocality and memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic parameterisations deployed in models of the Earth system frequently invoke locality assumptions such as Markovianity or spatial locality. This work highlights the impact of such assumptions on predictive performance. Both in terms of short-term forecasting and the representation of long-term statistics, we find locality assumptions to be detrimental in idealised experiments. We show, however, that judicious choice of Markovian parameterisation can mitigate errors due to assuming Markovianity. We propose a simple modification to standard Markovian parameterisations, which yields significant improvements in predictive skill while reducing computational cost. We further note a divergence between configurations of a parameterisation which perform best in short-term prediction and those which best represent time-invariant statistics.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hypergraphs and Some Invariant Subspaces of Matrices Associated with Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, the structural symmetries of a hypergraph are represented through equivalence relations on the vertex set of the hypergraph.
  A matrix associated with the hypergraph may not reflect a specific structural symmetry. In the context of a given symmetry within a hypergraph, we investigate a collection of matrices that encapsulate information about the symmetry. Our investigation reveals that certain structural symmetries in a hypergraph manifest observable effects on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of designated matrices associated with the hypergraph.
  We identify specific matrices where the invariance is a consequence of symmetries present in the hypergraph. These invariant subspaces elucidate analogous behaviours observed in certain clusters of vertices during random walks and other dynamical processes on the hypergraph.</description>

      <title>ADAM-SINDy: An Efficient Optimization Framework for Parameterized Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</description>

      <title>Existence of Liouvillian solutions in the Hess-Sretensky case of the problem of motion of a gyrostat with a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1890 W. Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler - Poisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963 L.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the Hess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a heavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous rotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were proposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a gyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.
  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a heavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately after this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of the problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case is reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by Sretensky.
  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order linear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to the form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the problem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second order linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters of the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding linear differential equation exist. Under these conditions equations of motion of a heavy gyrostat with a fixed point in the Hess - Sretensky case can be integrated in quadratures.</description>
