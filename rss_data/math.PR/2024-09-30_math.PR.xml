      <title>Stable random walks in cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a multidimensional random walk killed on leaving a right circular cone with a distribution of increments belonging to the normal domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable and rotationally-invariant law with $\alpha \in (0,2)\setminus \{1\}$. Based on Bogdan et al. (2018) describing the tail behaviour of the exit time of $\alpha$-stable process from a cone and using some properties of Martin kernel of the isotropic $\alpha$-stable process, in this paper we construct a positive harmonic function of the discrete time random walk under consideration. Then we find the asymptotic tail of the distribution of the exit time of this random walk from the cone. We also prove the corresponding conditional functional limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Renewal Processes Represented as Doubly Stochastic Poisson Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an elementary proof for the following theorem: a renewal process can be represented by a doubly-stochastic Poisson process (DSPP) if and only if the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the inter-arrival times is of the following form: $$\phi(\theta)=\lambda\left[\lambda+\theta+k\int_0^\infty\left(1-e^{-\theta z}\right)\,dG(z)\right]^{-1},$$ for some positive real numbers $\lambda, k$, and some distribution function $G$ with $G(\infty)=1$. The intensity process $\Lambda(t)$ of the corresponding DSPP jumps between $\lambda$ and $0$, with the time spent at $\lambda$ being independent random variables that are exponentially distributed with mean $1/k$, and the time spent at $0$ being independent random variables with distribution function $G$.</description>

      <title>Tightness for random walks driven by the two-dimensional Gaussian free field at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random walks in random environments generated by the two-dimensional Gaussian free field. More specifically, we consider a rescaled lattice with a small mesh size and view it as a random network where each edge is equipped with an electric resistance given by a regularization for the exponentiation of the Gaussian free field. We prove the tightness of random walks on such random networks at high temperature as the mesh size tends to 0. Our proof is based on a careful analysis of the (random) effective resistances as well as their connections to random walks.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of random stationary measures and applications to point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass rigidity of a stationary random measure $\mathsf{M}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (called number rigidity for a point process) entails that for a bounded set $A$ the knowledge of M on Ac determines $\mathsf{M}(A)$; the $k$-order rigidity for an integer $k$ means we can recover the moments of the restriction of $\mathsf{M}$ on $A^{c}$ up to order $k$. We show that the $k$-rigidity properties of a random stationary measure $\mathsf{M}$ can be characterised by the integrability properties around 0 of $s$, the continuous part of the spectral measure, by exploiting a connection with Schwartz' Paley-Wiener theorem for analytic functions of exponential type. If $1/s$ is not integrable in zero, $\mathsf{M}$ is mass rigid, and similarly if $s$ has a zero of order $2k$ in 0, then $\mathsf{M}$ is $k$-rigid. In the continuous setting, these local conditions are also necessary if $s$ has finitely many zeros, or is isotropic, or is at the opposite separable. This explains why no model seems to exhibit rigidity in dimension $d\geqslant 3$, and allows to efficiently recover many recent rigidity results about point processes. In the discrete setting, these results hold provided $\#A &gt; 2k$. For a continuous Determinantal point process with reduced kernel $\kappa$, $k$-rigidity is equivalent to $(1-\widehat{\kappa^2})^{-1}$ having a zero of order $2k$ in 0, which answers questions on completeness and number rigidity. We also explore the consequences of these statements in the less tractable realm of Riesz gases.</description>

      <title>A New Bound on the Cumulant Generating Function of Dirichlet Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for bounding the cumulant generating function (CGF) of a Dirichlet process (DP) $X \sim \text{DP}(\alpha \nu_0)$, using superadditivity. In particular, our key technical contribution is the demonstration of the superadditivity of $\alpha \mapsto \log \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \text{DP}(\alpha \nu_0)}[\exp( \mathbb{E}_X[\alpha f])]$, where $\mathbb{E}_X[f] = \int f dX$. This result, combined with Fekete's lemma and Varadhan's integral lemma, converts the known asymptotic large deviation principle into a practical upper bound on the CGF $ \log\mathbb{E}_{X\sim \text{DP}(\alpha\nu_0)}{\exp(\mathbb{E}_{X}{[f]})} $ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. The bound is given by the convex conjugate of the scaled reversed Kullback-Leibler divergence $\alpha\mathrm{KL}(\nu_0\Vert \cdot)$. This new bound provides particularly effective confidence regions for sums of independent DPs, making it applicable across various fields.</description>

      <title>Dark Subspaces and Invariant Measures of Quantum Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories are Markov processes describing the evolution of a quantum system subject to indirect measurements. They can be viewed as place dependent iterated function systems or the result of products of dependent and non identically distributed random matrices. In this article, we establish a complete classification of their invariant measures. The classification is done in two steps. First, we prove a Markov process on some linear subspaces called dark subspaces, defined in (Maassen, K\"ummerer 2006), admits a unique invariant measure. Second, we study the process inside the dark subspaces. Using a notion of minimal family of isometries from a reference space to dark subspaces, we prove a set of measures indexed by orbits of a unitary group is the set of ergodic measures of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Degree corrected stochastic block model: excursion representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of two complementary works in which we analyze the connected components of the degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM). Our model is a random graph with an underlying community structure and degree in-homogeneity. It belongs to a class of non-rank one models. The scaling limit of connected component sizes in the near-critical regime, obtained by Konarovskyi and Limic (2021) for a subfamily of DCSBM, is non-trivially different (although related to) the standard eternal multiplicative coalescent of Aldous (1997).
  The Aldous (1997) excursion representation combined with weak convergence approach to the scaling limits of connected components of random graphs proved to be much more difficult (and therefore rare) for non rank-one models. In this work we show how to build a random field encoding for the connected component structure of DCSBM, in part relying on the theory of Chaumont and Marolleau (2020). We then show how one can, under additional assumptions, reformulate the minimization problem stated in terms of multidimensional first hitting times into an equivalent minimization problem stated for a single real-valued stochastic process. This reformulation relies on a novel composition-like operator on pairs of compatible non-decreasing rcll functions, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution of large weighted multipartite random sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of eigenvalues of weighted adjacency matrices from a specific ensemble of random graphs. We distribute $N$ vertices across a fixed number $\kappa$ of components, with asymptotically $\alpha_j \dot N$ vertices in each component, where the vector $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{\kappa})$ is fixed. Consider a connected graph $\Gamma$ with $\kappa$ vertices. We construct a multipartite graph with $N$ vertices, in which all vertices in the $i$-th component are connected to all vertices in the $j$-th component if if $\Gamma_{ij}=1$. Conversely, if $\Gamma_{ij}=0$, no edge connects the $i$-th and $j$-th components. In the resulting graph, we independently retain each edge with a probability of $p/N$, where $p$ is a fixed parameter. To each remaining edge, we assign an independent weight with a fixed distribution, that possesses all finite moments. We establish the weak convergence in probability of a random counting measure to a non-random probability measure. Furthermore, the moments of the limiting measure can be derived from a system of recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>WHOMP: Optimizing Randomized Controlled Trials via Wasserstein Homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate methods for partitioning datasets into subgroups that maximize diversity within each subgroup while minimizing dissimilarity across subgroups. We introduce a novel partitioning method called the $\textit{Wasserstein Homogeneity Partition}$ (WHOMP), which optimally minimizes type I and type II errors that often result from imbalanced group splitting or partitioning, commonly referred to as accidental bias, in comparative and controlled trials. We conduct an analytical comparison of WHOMP against existing partitioning methods, such as random subsampling, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering, demonstrating its advantages. Moreover, we characterize the optimal solutions to the WHOMP problem and reveal an inherent trade-off between the stability of subgroup means and variances among these solutions. Based on our theoretical insights, we design algorithms that not only obtain these optimal solutions but also equip practitioners with tools to select the desired trade-off. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of WHOMP through numerical experiments, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new conformity score  for conformal prediction, in a general multivariate regression framework. The underlying score function is based on a covariance analysis of the residuals and the input points. We give theoretical guarantees on the prediction set. This set consists in an explicit ellipsoid that has a reduced volume compared to a classic ball. Further, we also study the asymptotic properties of the ellipsoid. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of  all our results on an in-depth numerical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii in the Nevanlinna and Smirnov classes. As it turns out these are characterized by the Blaschke condition. This follows from a more general result. Indeed, we show that this characterization is true in so-called big Hardy-Orlicz spaces. It is noteworthy to mention that conditions for deterministic interpolation in these spaces are given by harmonic majorants, the existence of which is difficult to check in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in this paper uniform exponential convergence of sample average approximation (SAA) with adaptive multiple importance sampling (AMIS) and asymptotics of its optimal value. Using a concentration inequality for bounded martingale differences, we obtain a new exponential convergence rate. To study the asymptotics, we first derive an important functional central limit theorem (CLT) for martingale difference sequences. Subsequently, exploiting this result with the Delta theorem, we prove the asymptotics of optimal values for SAA with AMIS.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Least Squares, Orthogonal Projection, and QR Factorization Algorithms Subject to Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Liesen et al. (2002), which analyzes how the condition number of an orthonormal matrix Q changes when a column is added ([Q, c]), particularly focusing on the perpendicularity of c to the span of Q. Their result, presented in Theorem 2.3 of Liesen et al. (2002), assumes exact arithmetic and orthonormality of Q, which is a strong assumption when applying these results to numerical methods such as QR factorization algorithms. In our work, we address this gap by deriving bounds on the condition number increase for a matrix B without assuming perfect orthonormality, even when a column is not perfectly orthogonal to the span of B. This framework allows us to analyze QR factorization methods where orthogonalization is imperfect and subject to Gaussian noise. We also provide results on the performance of orthogonal projection and least squares under Gaussian noise, further supporting the development of this theory.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>Tree height and the asymptotic mean of the Colijn-Plazzotta rank of unlabeled binary rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Colijn--Plazzotta ranking is a bijective encoding of the unlabeled binary rooted trees with positive integers. We show that the rank $f(t)$ of a tree $t$ is closely related to its height $h$, the length of the longest path from a leaf to the root. We consider the rank $f(\tau_n)$ of a random $n$-leaf tree $\tau_n$ under each of three models: (i) uniformly random unlabeled unordered binary rooted trees, or unlabeled topologies; (ii) uniformly random leaf-labeled binary trees, or labeled topologies under the uniform model; and (iii) random binary search trees, or labeled topologies under the Yule--Harding model. Relying on the close relationship between tree rank and tree height, we obtain results concerning the asymptotic properties of $\log \log f(\tau_n)$. In particular, we find $\mathbb{E} \{\log_2 \log f(\tau_n)\} \sim 2 \sqrt{\pi n}$ for uniformly random unlabeled ordered binary rooted trees and uniformly random leaf-labeled binary trees, and for a constant $\alpha \approx 4.31107$, $\mathbb{E}\{\log_2 \log f(\tau_n)\} \sim \alpha \log n $ for leaf-labeled binary trees under the Yule--Harding model. We show that the mean of $f(\tau_n)$ itself under the three models is largely determined by the rank $c_{n-1}$ of the highest-ranked tree -- the caterpillar -- obtaining an asymptotic relationship with $\pi_n c_{n-1}$, where $\pi_n$ is a model-specific function of $n$. The results resolve open problems, providing a new class of results on an encoding useful in mathematical phylogenetics.</description>

Abstract: We study asymptotic infinitesimal distributions of Gaussian Unitary Ensembles with permuted entries. We show that for random uniform permutations, the asymptotically permuted GUE matrix has a null infinitesimal distribution. Moreover, we show that asymptotically different permutations of the same GUE matrix are infinitesimally free. Besides this we study particular example of entry permutation - the transpose, and we show that while a GUE matrix is asymptotically free from its transpose it is not infinitesimally free from it.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on closed Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed in a previous work the $\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact boundaryless $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds as some invariant probability measures of some Markovian dynamics. We prove in the present work that these dynamics have unique invariant probability measures. This is done by using an explicit coupling by change of measure that does not require any a priori information on the support of the law of the solution to the dynamics. In addition, the coupling can be used to see that the semigroup generated by the dynamics satisfies a Harnack-type inequality, which entails that the semigroup has the strong Feller property.</description>

Abstract: We consider N x N matrices with complex entries that are perturbed by a complex Gaussian matrix with small variance. We prove that if the unperturbed matrix satisfies certain local laws then the bulk correlation functions are universal in the large N limit. Assuming the entries are independent and identically distributed with a common distribution that has finite moments, the Gaussian component is removed by the four moment theorem of Tao and Vu.</description>

Abstract: We consider real, Gauss-divisible matrices $A_{t}=A+\sqrt{t}B$, where $B$ is from the real Ginibre ensemble. We prove that the bulk correlation functions converge to a universal limit for $t=O(N^{-1/3+\epsilon})$ if $A$ satisfies certain local laws. If $A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}(\xi_{jk})_{j,k=1}^{N}$ with $\xi_{jk}$ independent and identically distributed real random variables having zero mean, unit variance and finite moments, the Gaussian component can be removed using local laws proven by Bourgade--Yau--Yin, Alt--Erd\H{o}s--Kr\"{u}ger and Cipolloni--Erd\H{o}s--Schr\"{o}der and the four moment theorem of Tao--Vu.</description>

Abstract: We consider a stationary Markovian evolution with values on a disjointly partitioned set space $I\sqcup {\cal E}$. The evolution is visible (in the sense of knowing the transition probabilities) on the states in $I$ but not for the states in ${\cal E}$. One only knows some partial information on the transition probabilities on ${\cal E}$, the input and output transition probabilities and some constraints of the transition probabilities on ${\cal E}$. Under some conditions we supply the transition probabilities on ${\cal E}$ that satisfies the maximum entropy principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>On the representation property for 1D general diffusion semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingle part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor, and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <title>Malliavin calculus on the Clifford algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00715v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with Malliavin calculus on the $L^2$ space of the $W^*$-algebra generated by fermion fields (the Clifford algebra). First, we verify the product formula for multiple integrals in It\^o-Clifford calculus, which is It\^o calculus on the Clifford algebra. Using this product formula, we can define the derivation operator and the divergence operator. Anti-symmetric Malliavin calculus thus constructed has properties similar to those of usual Malliavin calculus. The derivation operator and the divergence operator satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations, and the divergence operator serves as an extension of the It\^o-Clifford stochastic integral, satisfying the Clark-Ocone formula. Subsequently, using this calculus, we consider the concentration inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the fourth-moment theorem. As for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, only a weaker result is obtained. On the other hand, as for the concentration inequality, we obtain results that are almost similar to those of the usual case; moreover, the results concerning the fourth-moment theorem imply that, unlike in the case of the usual Brownian motion, convergence in distribution cannot be deduced from the convergence of the fourth moment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the regularising properties of singular kernels at the level of germs, i.e. families of distributions indexed by points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. First we construct a suitable integration map which acts on general coherent germs. Then we focus on germs that can be decomposed along a basis (corresponding to the so-called modelled distributions in Regularity Structures) and we prove a version of Hairer's multilevel Schauder estimates in this setting, with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Error Distribution for One-Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation Driven By Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We can define the error distribution as the limiting distribution of the error between the solution $Y$ of a given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and its numerical approximation $\hat{Y}^{(m)}$, weighted by the convergence rate between the two. A goal when studying the error distribution is to provide a way of determination for error distributions for any SDE and numerical scheme that converge to the exact solution. By dividing the error into a main term and a remainder term in a particular way, the author shows that the remainder term can be negligible compared to the main term under certain suitable conditions. Under these conditions, deriving the error distribution reduces to deriving the limiting distribution of the main term. Even if the dimension is one, there are unsolved problems about the asymptotic behavior of the error when the SDE has a drift term and $0&lt;H\leq 1/3$, but our result in the one-dimensional case can be adapted to any Hurst exponent. The main idea of the proof is to define a stochastic process $Y^{m, \rho}$ with the parameter $\rho$ interpolating between $Y$ and $\hat{Y}^{(m)}$ and to estimate the asymptotic expansion for it. Using this estimate, we determine the error distribution of the ($k$)-Milstein scheme and of the Crank-Nicholson scheme in unsolved cases.</description>

      <title>The Change-of-Measure Method, Block Lewis Weights, and Approximating Matrix Block Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$, a partitioning of $[k]$ into groups $S_1,\dots,S_m$, an outer norm $p$, and a collection of inner norms such that either $p \ge 1$ and $p_1,\dots,p_m \ge 2$ or $p_1=\dots=p_m=p \ge 1/\log n$, we prove that there is a sparse weight vector $\mathbf{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^m \mathbf{\beta}_i \cdot \|\mathbf{A}_{S_i}\mathbf{x}\|_{p_i}^p \approx_{1\pm\varepsilon} \sum_{i=1}^m \|\mathbf{A}_{S_i}\mathbf{x}\|_{p_i}^p$, where the number of nonzero entries of $\mathbf{\beta}$ is at most $O_{p,p_i}(\varepsilon^{-2}n^{\max(1,p/2)}(\log n)^2(\log(n/\varepsilon)))$. When $p_1\dots,p_m \ge 2$, this weight vector arises from an importance sampling procedure based on the \textit{block Lewis weights}, a recently proposed generalization of Lewis weights. Additionally, we prove that there exist efficient algorithms to find the sparse weight vector $\mathbf{\beta}$ in several important regimes of $p$ and $p_1,\dots,p_m$. Our results imply a $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\sqrt{n})$-linear system solve iteration complexity for the problem of minimizing sums of Euclidean norms, improving over the previously known $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m}\log({1/\varepsilon}))$ iteration complexity when $m \gg n$.
  Our main technical contribution is a substantial generalization of the \textit{change-of-measure} method that Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, and Milman used to obtain the analogous result when every group has size $1$. Our generalization allows one to analyze change of measures beyond those implied by D. Lewis's original construction, including the measure implied by the block Lewis weights and natural approximations of this measure.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>
