      <title>A characterization of the distances between Pisot numbers generating the same number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let K be a real algebraic number field and let P be the set of Pisot numbers generating K. We show that the elements of P-P are the algebraic integers of K whose images under the action of all embeddings of K into C, other than the identity of K, are of modulus less than 2. This completes certain previous results due to Dubickas and the second author. Also, from the proof of this result, based on Minkowski's theorem on compact, convex and symmetric bodies, we deduce some related known results.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of semisimple adelic periods and representations of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for semisimple closed orbits on compact adelic quotients. The obtained error depends polynomially on the minimal complexity of intermediate orbits and the complexity of the ambient space. The proof uses dynamical arguments, property $(\tau)$, Prasad's volume formula, an effective closing lemma, and a novel effective generation result for subgroups. The latter in turn relies on an effective version of Greenberg's theorem.
  We apply the above to the problem of establishing a local-global principle for representations of integral quadratic forms, improving the codimension assumptions and providing effective bounds in a theorem of Ellenberg and Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Ordinary primes for $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties and weight $2$ modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional abelian variety defined over a number field $F$. It is conjectured that the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density, and this is known to be true when $g=1, 2$, or for certain abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms. In this paper, we extend the family of abelian varieties whose sets of ordinary primes have positive density. Specifically, we show that if the endomorphism algebra of $A$ contains a number field $K$ of degree $g$, then under certain conditions on the fields $F$ and $K$, the set of ordinary primes of $A$ over $F$ has positive density. This includes $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ (resp. quadratic number fields) of dimension $q$ or $2q$ (resp. $q$) for any rational prime $q$. The proof is carried out in the general setting of compatible systems of Galois representations, and as a consequence, it also implies a positive density result for the sets of ordinary primes of certain modular forms of weight $2$.</description>

      <title>Power-free palindromes and reversed primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new results related to the digital reverse $\overleftarrow{n}$ of a positive integer $n$ in a fixed base $b$. First we show that for $b\geq 26000$, there exists infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\overleftarrow{p}$ is square-free. Further, we show that there are infinitely many palindromes (with $n=\overleftarrow{n}$) that are 4th power-free. We also give asymptotic expressions for the counting functions corresponding to these results. The main tools we use are recent bounds from the literature on reversed primes and palindromes in arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish a classification theorem for such equations of degree 5 in 6 variables. The proof is based on an elementary polynomial identity, which Kawada and Wooley (1999) employed in their work on the Waring problem, and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. We then prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational solutions of Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree 5, especially for the Chebyshev measure of the first kind. It is noteworthy that this result presents a completely explicit construction of rational solutions. Moreover, we create novel connections among Hilbert-Kamke equations, geometric designs and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem. For example, we establish that our solutions of Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree 5 in 6 variables appear in the famous parametric solution for the PTE problem found by Borwein (2002).</description>

      <title>Metric theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations with a fixed matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a metric theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation for the case of a fixed matrix. We use transference principle to connect uniform Diophantine properties of a pair $(\Theta, \pmb{\eta})$ of a matrix and a vector with the asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix $\Theta^{\top}$, and vice versa, the asymptotic Diophantine properties of a pair $(\Theta, \pmb{\eta})$ with asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix. In these setups, we prove analogues of classical statements of metrical homogeneous Diophantine approximations and answer some open questions that were raised in recent works.</description>

      <title>The $(p,t,a)$-inertial groups as finite monodromy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silverberg and Zarhin introduced the notion of a $(p,t,a)$-inertial group in the hope of having a group theoretic characterization of the finite groups that appear as finite monodromy groups -- the group that represent the local obstruction to semi-stable reduction -- of abelian varieties in fixed dimension $t+a$. In this text, we provide a positive answer to this problem for $p$-groups by reframing the question as one of realizing skew fields as endomorphism algebras of abelian varieties over finite fields.</description>

Abstract: We compute the packets, precisely Arthur's groups $S$, in local Langlands correspondence for Brylinski-Deligne covering groups of algebraic tori, under some assumption on ramification. Especially, this work generalizes Weissman's result on covering groups of tori that split over an unramified extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>On the Distribution of 2-Selmer ranks of Quadratic Twists of Elliptic Curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the distribution of 2-Selmer ranks of quadratic twists of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with full rational 2-torsion. We propose a new type of random alternating matrix model $M_{*,\mathbf t}^{\mathrm{Alt}}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ with 0, 1 or 2 ``holes'', with associated Markov chains, described by parameter $\mathbf t=(t_1,\cdots,t_s)\in\mathbb{Z}^s$ where $s$ is the number of ``holes''. We proved that for each equivalence classes of quadratic twists of elliptic curves:
  (1) The distribution of 2-Selmer ranks agrees with the distribution of coranks of matrices in $M_{*,\mathbf t}^{\mathrm{Alt}}(\mathbb{F}_2)$;
  (2) The moments of 2-Selmer groups agree with that of $M_{*,\mathbf t}^{\mathrm{Alt}}(\mathbb{F}_2)$, in particular, the average order of essential 2-Selmer groups is $3+\sum_i2^{t_i}$.
  Our work extends the works of Heath-Brown, Swinnerton-Dyer, Kane, and Klagsbrun-Mazur-Rubin where the matrix only has 0 ``holes'', the matrix model is the usual random alternating matrix model, and the average order of essential 2-Selmer groups is 3. A new phenomenon is that different equivalence classes in the same quadratic twist family could have different parameters, hence have different distribution of 2-Selmer ranks. The irreducible property of the Markov chain associated to $M_{*,\mathbf t}^{\mathrm{Alt}}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ gives the positive density results on the distribution of 2-Selmer ranks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note concerns the non-existence of three consecutive powerful numbers. We use Pell equations, elliptic curves, and second-order recurrences to show that there are no such triplets with the middle term a perfect cube and each of the other two having only a single prime factor raised to an odd power.</description>

      <title>Almost cubes and fourth powers in short intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how short an interval $[x, x + x^\theta]$ contains an integer of the form $n_1 n_2 n_3$ and $m_1 m_2 m_3 m_4$ with $n_1 \approx n_2 \approx n_3$ and $m_1 \approx m_2 \approx m_3 \approx m_4$. The new idea is to adopt a second moment method (usually used for almost all results) to deduce a result for all short intervals.</description>

      <title>Computing Isomorphisms between Products of Supersingular Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deligne-Ogus-Shioda theorem guarantees the existence of isomorphisms between products of supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields. In this paper, we present methods for explicitly computing these isomorphisms in polynomial time, given the endomorphism rings of the curves involved. Our approach leverages the Deuring correspondence, enabling us to reformulate computational isogeny problems into algebraic problems in quaternions. Specifically, we reduce the computation of isomorphisms to solving systems of quadratic and linear equations over the integers derived from norm equations. We develop $\ell$-adic techniques for solving these equations when we have access to a low discriminant subring. Combining these results leads to the description of an efficient probabilistic Las Vegas algorithm for computing the desired isomorphisms. Under GRH, it is proved to run in expected polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $\mathfrak{p} \mid (2)$ be a prime ideal. We compute the fourth level of the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic completions of $K$ when the ramification index is $4$ and the inertial degree is trivial for the ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. We then apply this result to biquadratic number fields and obtain lower bounds for the fourth level of such number fields.</description>

      <title>On the conductor of a family of Frey hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his breakthrough article, Darmon presented a program to study Generalized Fermat Equations (GFE) via abelian varieties of $\text{GL}_2$-type over totally real fields. So far, only Jacobians of some Frey hyperelliptic curves have been used with that purpose. In the present article, we show how most of the known Frey hyperelliptic curves are particular instances of a more general biparametric family of hyperelliptic curves $C(z,s)$. Then, we apply the cluster picture methodology to compute the conductor of $C(z,s)$ at all odd places.
  As a Diophantine application, we specialize $C(z,s)$ in some particular values $z_0$ and $s_0$, and we find the conductor exponent at odd places of the natural Frey hyperelliptic curves attached to $Ax^p+By^p=Cz^r$ and $Ax^r+By^r=Cz^p$, generalizing the results due to Azon, Curc\'o-Iranzo, Khawaja, Maistret and Mocanu, and opening the door for future research in GFE with coefficients. Moreover, we show how a new Frey hyperelliptic curve for $Ax^2+By^r=Cz^p$ can be constructed in this way, giving new results on the conductor exponents for this equation.
  Finally, following the recent approach by Golfieri and Pacetti, we consider the Frey representations attached to a general signature $(q,r,p)$ via hypergeometric motives and, using $C(z,s)$, we compute the wild part of the conductor exponent at primes above $q$ and $r$ of the residual representation modulo a prime above $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multi-variable zeta integrals which unfold to Euler products representing the triple product $L$-function times a product of $L$-functions with known analytic properties. We then formulate a generalization of the Poisson summation conjecture and show how it implies the analytic properties of triple product $L$-functions. Finally, we propose a strategy, the fiber bundle method, to reduce this generalized conjecture to a simpler case of the Poisson summation conjecture along with certain local compatibility statements.</description>

      <title>Twisted moments of characteristic polynomials of random matrices in the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Keating and the second author of this paper devised a heuristic for predicting asymptotic formulas for moments of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. Their approach indicates how lower twisted moments of $\zeta(s)$ may be used to evaluate higher moments. In this paper, we present a rigorous random matrix theory analogue of their heuristic. To do this, we develop a notion of "twisted moment" of characteristic polynomials of matrices in the unitary group $U(N)$, and we prove several identities involving Schur polynomials. Our results may be viewed as a proof of concept of the heuristic for $\zeta(s)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers permutation polynomials over the finite field $F_{q^2}$ in even characteristic by utilizing low-degree permutation rational functions over $F_q$. As a result, we obtain two classes of permutation binomials and six classes of permutation pentanomials over $F_{q^2}$. Additionally, we show that the obtained binomials and pentanomials are quasi-multiplicative inequivalent to the known ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution in rank 2 homogeneous spaces and values of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish effective equidistribution theorems, with a polynomial error rate, for orbits of unipotent subgroups in quotients of quasi-split, almost simple Linear algebraic groups of absolute rank 2.
  As an application, inspired by the results of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes, we establish quantitative results regarding the distribution of values of an indefinite ternary quadratic form at integer points, giving in particular an effective and quantitative proof of the Oppenheim Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the inverse problem of the $k$-th Davenport constants for groups of rank $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite abelian group $G$ and a positive integer $k$, let $\mathsf{D}_k(G)$ denote the smallest integer $\ell$ such that each sequence over $G$ of length at least $\ell$ has $k$ disjoint nontrivial zero-sum subsequences. It is known that $\mathsf D_k(G)=n_1+kn_2-1$ if $G\cong C_{n_1}\oplus C_{n_2}$ is a rank $2$ group, where $1&lt;n_1\t n_2$. We investigate the associated inverse problem for rank $2$ groups, that is, characterizing the structure of zero-sum sequences of length $\mathsf D_k(G)$ that can not be partitioned into $k+1$ nontrivial zero-sum subsequences.</description>

      <title>On the modularity of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the modularity of every elliptic curve $E/F$, where $F$ runs over infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields, including $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ for $d=1,2,3,5$. More precisely, let $F$ be imaginary quadratic and assume that the modular curve $X_0(15)$, which is an elliptic curve of rank $0$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, also has rank $0$ over $F$. Then we prove that all elliptic curves over $F$ are modular. More generally, when $F/\mathbb{Q}$ is an imaginary CM field that does not contain a primitive fifth root of unity, we prove the modularity of elliptic curves $E/F$ under a technical assumption on the image of the representation of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$ on $E[3]$ or $E[5]$.
  The key new technical ingredient we use is a local-global compatibility theorem for the $p$-adic Galois representations associated to torsion in the cohomology of the relevant locally symmetric spaces. We establish this result in the crystalline case, under some technical assumptions, but allowing arbitrary dimension, arbitrarily large regular Hodge--Tate weights, and allowing $p$ to be small and highly ramified in the imaginary CM field $F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Christol's theorem states that a power series with coefficients in a finite field is algebraic if and only if its coefficient sequence is automatic. A natural question is how the size of a polynomial describing such a sequence relates to the size of an automaton describing the same sequence. Bridy used tools from algebraic geometry to bound the size of the minimal automaton for a sequence, given its minimal polynomial. We produce a new proof of Bridy's bound by embedding algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Ramanujan and Sato-Tate conjectures for Bianchi modular forms of weight at least 2. More generally, we prove these conjectures for all regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{A}_F)$ of parallel weight, where $F$ is any CM field. We deduce these theorems from a new potential automorphy theorem for the symmetric powers of 2-dimensional compatible systems of Galois representations of parallel weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the structure theory of finite dimensional algebras in order to deduce dimension formulas for spaces of period numbers, i.e., complex numbers defined by integrals of algebraic nature. We get a complete and conceptually clear answer in the case of $1$-periods, generalising classical results like Baker's theorem on the logarithms of algebraic numbers and partial results in Huber--W{\"u}stholz \cite{huber-wuestholz}.
  The application to the case of Mixed Tate Motives (i.e., Multiple Zeta Values) recovers the dimension estimates of Deligne--Goncharov \cite{deligne-goncharov}.</description>

      <title>An exact family of bivariate polynomials and Variants of Chinburg's Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides some solutions to Chinburg's conjectures by studying a sequence of multivariate polynomials. These conjectures assert that for every odd quadratic Dirichlet Character of conductor $f$, $\chi_{-f}=\left(\frac{-f}{.}\right)$, there exists a bivariate polynomial (or a rational function in the weak version) whose Mahler measure is a rational multiple of $L'(\chi_{-f},-1)$. To obtain such solutions for the conjectures we investigate a polynomial family denoted by $P_d(x,y)$, whose Mahler measure has been recently studied. We demonstrate that the Mahler measure of $P_d$ can be expressed as a linear combination of Dirichlet $L$-functions, which has the potential to generate solutions to Chinburg's conjectures. Specifically, we prove that this family provides solutions for conductors $f=3,4,8,15,20$, and $24$. Notably, $P_d$ polynomials also provide intriguing examples where the Mahler measures are linked to $L'(\chi,-1)$ with $\chi$ being an odd non-real primitive Dirichlet character. These examples inspired us to generalize Chinburg's conjectures from real primitive odd Dirichlet characters to all primitive odd characters. For this generalized version of Chinburg's conjecture, $P_d$ polynomials provide solutions for conductors $5,7$, and $9$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we are interested in whether a product of three consecutive integers $a (a+1) (a+2)$ divides another such product $b (b+1) (b+2)$. If this happens, we prove that there is some gaps between them, namely $b \gg \frac{a \log a)^{1/6}}{\log \log a)^{1/3}}$. We also consider other polynomial sequences such as $a^2 (a^2 + l)$ dividing $b^2 (b^2 + l)$ for some fixed integer $l$. Our method is based on effective Liouville-Baker-Feldman theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study $\ell$-isogeny graphs of ordinary elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with an added level structure. Given an integer $N$ coprime to $p$ and $\ell,$ we look at the graphs obtained by adding $\Gamma_0(N),$ $\Gamma_1(N),$ and $\Gamma(N)$-level structures to volcanoes. Given an order $\mathcal{O}$ in an imaginary quadratic field $K,$ we look at the action of generalised ideal class groups of $\mathcal{O}$ on the set of elliptic curves whose endomorphism rings are $\mathcal{O}$ along with a given level structure. We show how the structure of the craters of these graphs is determined by the choice of parameters.</description>

Abstract: Mollifiers are used in a variety of contexts, for instance to study the non-vanishing of $L$-functions. In this paper, we study the general question of finding optimal mollifiers and provide criteria to identify them provided the corresponding mollified moments can be computed. As an application, we study the non-vanishing of central values of Dirichlet $L$-functions. In particular we show that the Michel-Vanderkam mollifier is optimal in a wide class of balanced two-piece mollifiers as well as provide the first published proof that the Iwaniec-Sarnak mollifier is optimal in a wide class of one-piece mollifiers.</description>

As applications, we construct an unambiguous local Langlands correspondence for even orthogonal groups, deduce Fargues' eigen-sheaf conjecture, and prove new torsion vanishing results for orthogonal and unitary Shimura varieties.</description>

We also establish several local results on relative characters.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two finiteness results and propose a conjecture concerning the Pythagoras number $P(A)$ of a finitely generated real algebra $A$. Let $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ be an integral projective surface over $\mathbb{R}$, and let $s \in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ be a nonzero section such that the boundary $\partial_{X(\mathbb{C})}\bigl(X_{s\neq 0}(\mathbb{R})\bigr)$, taken in the standard topology, is Zariski dense in $X_{s=0}$. We prove $P\bigl(\Gamma(X_{s\neq 0})\bigr)=\infty$. As a corollary, the Pythagoras numbers of integral smooth affine curves over $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to be unbounded. For any finitely generated $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $A$, if the Zariski closure of the real points of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ has dimension less than two, we demonstrate $P(A)&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>
