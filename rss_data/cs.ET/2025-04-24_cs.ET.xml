      <title>Reflexive Prompt Engineering: A Framework for Responsible Prompt Engineering and Interaction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical framework for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems serve society's needs while minimizing potential harms. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging practices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach aligns with broader "Responsibility by Design" principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Meets Adaptive Honeypots: A Trust-Aware Approach to Next-Gen IoT Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing-based Next-Generation Wireless Networks (NGWN)-IoT offer enhanced bandwidth capacity for large-scale service provisioning but remain vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. Existing intrusion detection and prevention methods provide limited security as adversaries continually adapt their attack strategies. We propose a dynamic attack detection and prevention approach to address this challenge. First, blockchain-based authentication uses the Deoxys Authentication Algorithm (DAA) to verify IoT device legitimacy before data transmission. Next, a bi-stage intrusion detection system is introduced: the first stage uses signature-based detection via an Improved Random Forest (IRF) algorithm. In contrast, the second stage applies feature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level Agreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based Optimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots deceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The proposed framework is implemented in the NS3 simulation environment and evaluated against existing methods across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, attack detection rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, ROC curve, memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, reinforcing the security of NGWN-enabled IoT ecosystems</description>

      <title>Insect-Computer Hybrid Speaker: Speaker using Chirp of the Cicada Controlled by Electrical Muscle Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose "Insect-Computer Hybrid Speaker", which enables us to make musics made from combinations of computer and insects. Lots of studies have proposed methods and interfaces for controlling insects and obtaining feedback. However, there have been less research on the use of insects for interaction with third parties. In this paper, we propose a method in which cicadas are used as speakers triggered by using Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). We explored and investigated the suitable waveform of chirp to be controlled, the appropriate voltage range, and the maximum pitch at which cicadas can chirp.</description>

      <title>HAQA: A Hardware-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Strategy for Efficient Qubit Mapping Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms rely on quantum computers for implementation, but the physical connectivity constraints of modern quantum processors impede the efficient realization of quantum algorithms. Qubit mapping, a critical technology for practical quantum computing applications, directly determines the execution efficiency and feasibility of algorithms on superconducting quantum processors. Existing mapping methods overlook intractable quantum hardware fidelity characteristics, reducing circuit execution quality. They also exhibit prolonged solving times or even failure to complete when handling large-scale quantum architectures, compromising efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel qubit mapping method HAQA. HAQA first introduces a community-based iterative region identification strategy leveraging hardware connection topology, achieving effective dimensionality reduction of mapping space. This strategy avoids global search procedures, with complexity analysis demonstrating quadratic polynomial-level acceleration. Furthermore, HAQA implements a hardware-characteristic-based region evaluation mechanism, enabling quantitative selection of mapping regions based on fidelity metrics. This approach effectively integrates hardware fidelity information into the mapping process, enabling fidelity-aware qubit allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that HAQA significantly improves solving speed and fidelity while ensuring solution quality. When applied to state-of-the-art quantum mapping techniques Qsynth-v2 and TB-OLSQ2, HAQA achieves acceleration ratios of 632.76 and 286.87 respectively, while improving fidelity by up to 52.69% and 238.28%</description>

      <title>Exploring human-SAV interaction using large language models: The impact of psychological ownership and anthropomorphism on user experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a control condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing LLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.</description>

      <title>QAOA-PCA: Enhancing Efficiency in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm via Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices. However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly. This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed. To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.</description>
