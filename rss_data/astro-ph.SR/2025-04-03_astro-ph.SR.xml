      <title>Photometric investigation of WY Leo: An Eclipsing binary system with Delta Scuti component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing binary stars with Delta Scuti components are exceptional systems for gaining a deeper understanding of stellar systems. WY Leo is one such system, exhibiting Delta Scuti-type oscillations. However, it has not been extensively studied in the literature. WY Leo was observed by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), providing two sectors of high-quality photometric data. This study focuses on the photometric analysis of WY Leo. Binary modeling was performed, and the system's fundamental stellar parameters, such as mass and radius, were determined. The pulsational properties of WY Leo were also investigated, revealing that the more luminous star exhibits Delta Scuti type oscillations with a period of 0.052 days. The position of the primary component was examined on the HR diagram, and it was found to lie within the Delta Scuti instability strip.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720): III. A dusty disk around its Central Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planetary nebula NGC 6720, also known as the ``Ring Nebula", is one of the most iconic examples of nearby planetary nebulae whose morphologies present a challenge to our theoretical understanding of the processes that govern the deaths of most stars in the Universe that evolve on a Hubble time. We present new imaging with JWST of the central star of this planetary nebula (CSPN) and its close vicinity, in the near- to mid-IR wavelength range. We find the presence of a dust cloud around the CSPN, both from the spectral energy distribution at wavelengths &gt;~5 micron, as well as radially-extended emission in the 7.7, 10 and 11.3 micron images. From modeling of these data, we infer that the CSPN has a luminosity of 310 Lsun and is surrounded by a dust cloud with a size of ~2600 au, consisting of relatively small amorphous silicate dust grains (radius ~0.01 micron) with a total mass of 1.9 x 10^(-6) M_earth. However, our best-fit model shows a significant lack of extended emission at 7.7 micron -- we show that such emission can arise from a smaller (7.3 x 10^(-7) M_earth) but uncertain mass of (stochastically-heated) ionized PAHs. However, the same energetic radiation also rapidly destroys PAH molecules, suggesting that these are most likely being continuously replenished, via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the collisional grinding of planetesimals. We also find significant photometric variability of the central source that could be due to the presence of a close dwarf companion of mass &lt; ~0.1 Msun.</description>

      <title>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</description>

      <title>Photometry and Spectroscopy of the Symbiotic Binary V1413 Aquilae during the 2024 Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the 2024 eclipse of the symbiotic binary V1413 Aquilae. We found the system in a visually bright state and the eclipse time of minimum consistent with the published ephemeris. The eclipse profile showed that the hot component was an extended object rather than an isolated white dwarf. By analyzing the eclipse profile we estimated the orbital inclination to be 67.9{\deg}, the radius of the extended hot component surrounding the white dwarf to be 39.3 Rsun, and that the red giant star was probably filling its Roche Lobe. From our flux calibrated spectra, we determined the brightest component of the system to be the hot component whose continuum and emission lines together are responsible for 83% of the V-band light. The circumbinary nebula and its emission lines contribute over 14%, while the red giant is responsible for less than 3%. Our spectra revealed a rich harvest of low ionization emission lines. By measuring how flux in these emission lines varied through the eclipse, we have provided information which should prove useful for future modelling of this symbiotic system.</description>

      <title>A 0.3\% calibration of the W UMa-type contact binary luminosity based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: W Ursa Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems (CBs) with period--luminosity (PL) relations are valuable distance indicators. The PL relations of CBs are affected by metallicity. Here, we establish PL relations and period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations in nine bands from optical to mid-infrared ($BP$, $G$, $RP$, $J$, $H$, $K_S$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$) and in five Wesenheit bands based on Gaia DR3 parallaxes. The dispersion of PLZ relations gradually decreases from the optical to mid-infrared bands, with the minimum dispersion of 0.138 mag. We fit the best PL relations for three bands ($W1$, $W_{G,BP,RP}$, $W_{W1,BP,RP}$) under different parallax uncertainty criteria and determine a parallax (after correction) zero point of $zp_\varpi=24\pm4$ $\mu$as. After fixing the parallax zero point, we find that the total zero errors of the PL and PLZ relation are smallest when the parallax uncertainty is less than 2\%, resulting in a calibrated CB luminosity with an accuracy of 0.33\%, which is more accurate than the classical Cepheids. Furthermore, by examining the absolute magnitude residuals in different metallicity intervals, we find that the use of a linear metallicity effect is appropriate for CBs with different metallicities. These results indicate that CBs are excellent standard candles.</description>

      <title>Acoustic modes in M67 cluster stars trace deepening convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors. Frequency differences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar density, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations -- probe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence Sun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large separations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep regime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

      <title>Thermal Desorption Kinetics, Binding Energies, and Entrapment of Methyl Mercaptan Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.</description>

      <title>The Receding Cosmic Shoreline of Mid-to-Late M Dwarfs: Measurements of Active Lifetimes Worsen Challenges for Atmosphere Retention by Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets is a key goal of exoplanetary astronomy, one that may now be within reach given the upcoming campaign to conduct a large-scale survey of rocky M-dwarf worlds with the James Webb Space Telescope. It is imperative that we understand where known planets sit relative to the cosmic shoreline, the boundary between planets that have retained atmospheres and those that have not. Previous works modeled the historic XUV radiation received by mid-to-late M-dwarf planets using a scaling relation calibrated using more massive stars, but fully convective M dwarfs display unique rotation/activity histories that differ from Sun-like stars and early M dwarfs. We synthesize observations of the active lifetimes of mid-to-late M dwarfs to present an updated estimate of their historic XUV fluence. For known planets of inactive, mid-to-late M dwarfs, we calculate a historic XUV fluence that is 2.1-3.1 times the canonical XUV scaling relation on average, with the larger value including corrections for the pre-main-sequence phase and energetic flares. We find that only the largest terrestrial planets known to orbit mid-to-late M-dwarfs are likely to have retained atmospheres within the cosmic shoreline paradigm. Our calculations may help to guide the selection of targets for JWST and may prove useful in interpreting the results; to this end, we define a novel Atmosphere Retention Metric (ARM) that indicates the distance between a planet and the cosmic shoreline, and tabulate the ARM for known mid-to-late M-dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning photometric classifier for massive stars in nearby galaxies II. The catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass loss is a key aspect of stellar evolution, particularly in evolved massive stars, yet episodic mass loss remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we need evolved massive stellar populations across various galactic environments. However, spectral classifications are challenging to obtain in large numbers, especially for distant galaxies. We addressed this by leveraging machine-learning techniques. We combined \textit{Spitzer} photometry and Pan-STARRS1 optical data to classify point sources in 26 galaxies within 5 Mpc, and a metallicity range 0.07-1.36 Z$_\odot$. \textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry was used to remove foreground sources. Classifications are derived using a machine-learning model developed by Maravelias et al. (2022). We report classifications for 1,147,650 sources, with 276,657 sources ($\sim24\%$) being robust. Among these are 120,479 Red Supergiants (RSGs; $\sim11\%$). The classifier performs well even at low metallicities ($\sim0.1$ Z$_\odot$) and distances under 1.5 Mpc, with a slight decrease in accuracy beyond $\sim3$ Mpc due to \textit{Spitzer}'s resolution limits. We also identified 21 luminous RSGs ($\textrm{log}(L/L_\odot)\ge5.5$), 159 dusty Yellow Hypergiants in M31 and M33, as well as 6 extreme RSGs ($\textrm{log}(L/L_\odot)\ge6$) in M31, challenging observed luminosity limits. Class trends with metallicity align with expectations, though biases exist. This catalog serves as a valuable resource for individual-object studies and \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope target selection. It enables follow-up on luminous RSGs and Yellow Hypergiants to refine our understanding of their evolutionary pathways. Additionally, we provide the largest spectroscopically confirmed catalog of massive stars and candidates to date, comprising 5,273 sources (including $\sim330$ other objects).</description>

      <title>Planets in Globular Clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of planets around PSR~1257+12 suggests that planetary systems may be detected around the recycled pulsars found in globular clusters. Planetary systems in dense clusters have lifetimes to disruption due to perturbations by passing stars comparable to or shorter than the pulsar lifetime, and observations of planets in the cores of clusters may reveal planetary systems formally dynamically unstable on time scales short compared to the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, of the system. Planets formed around cluster pulsars will most likely be restricted to semi--major axis of $\sim 0.1-1.0\, AU$, while "scavenged" planets may be observed in wider orbits, with no stable systems expected in the densest clusters. Observation is most probable in the cluster rich high--density pre-core collapse clusters such as 47Tuc. Detection of planets around cluster pulsars can constrain planet formation mechanisms, in particular the effects of low metallicity on planet formation in disks.</description>

      <title>Observational diversity of bright long-lived Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various types of supernovae (SNe), strong interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) has been reported. This raises questions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the explosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to be a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational properties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system and underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before the explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of bright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their CSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss mechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We performed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe. Based on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and well-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da and 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows luminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the photometric evolution (from $\sim-17$ to $\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$ band even at $\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric spectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with some variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with slight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time (from $\sim3-6$ \% before the peak to $\sim1$ \% at $\sim200$ days after the peak). The observational properties are consistent with the disk-CSM-interaction scenario, i.e., typical Type~II SNe interacting with disk-like CSM.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Imaging Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed three commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective optical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise data processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including the removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux calibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations taken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable astrometric precision of approximately 70--80\,mas (about 0.1\,pixel), an impressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\,mmag in the MST zero points, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\,mmag for bright stars. Our studies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable to that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical time-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in future large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the scale of star formation across the Perseus spiral arm using young clusters around Cas OB5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cas OB5 is an OB association located at a distance of 2.5-3 kpc that intercepts the Perseus spiral arm. It carries a moderate amount of reddening ($A_V \sim$ 2-3 mag) and contains several well-known open clusters within its boundaries, such as King 12, NGC 7788, and NGC 7790. The availability of modern clustering algorithms, together with \textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and complementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of Galactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in the spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to more distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695 candidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the physical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we then clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area, four of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different age groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic observations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790 ($110\pm15\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a few tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse population of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic analysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could separate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones. These results highlight the need to combine these techniques to fully disentangle the Milky Way structure.</description>

      <title>Open cluster age calibration from colour-magnitude morphological indices using Gaia DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters are crucial for understanding how stars evolve. Their colour-magnitude diagrams show the effects of stellar evolution of approximately coeval objects with the same chemical composition. Furthermore, the determination of their astrophysical parameters (age, distance, colour excess and metallicity) together with their spatial distribution provides information about the structure and the evolution of the Galaxy itself. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and 2MASS catalogues, we develop methodologies for characterizing open clusters. Precise membership lists, mean astrometric parameters and radii are obtained. Using photometric data from both data sources, we carried out new age calibrations that rely on morphological indices based on colour ($\Delta BR$) and magnitude ($\Delta G$) differences between the red clump and the turnoff for a sample of 34 open clusters with ages covering the interval $8.3 &lt; \log[t({\rm yr})] &lt; 9.9$. A set of age calibration functions based on \textit{Gaia} morphological age indices are determined for the first time. We demonstrate their accuracy, obtaining a mean residual of 0.06 dex in $\log[t(yr)]$. Our results also show that stellar evolution models tend to predict the difference $\Delta G$. However, they typically overestimate the difference $\Delta BR$ for objects younger than $\log[t({\rm yr})] = 8.8$.</description>

      <title>Exploring nuclear force with pulsar glitch observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect nuclear forces to one of the most notable irregular behaviors observed in pulsars, already detected in approximately 6\% known pulsars, with increasingly accurate data expected from upcoming high-precision timing instruments on both ground and space. Built on Shang &amp; Li (2021), we conduct a case study on the 2001 glitch of the Vela pulsar. For our purpose, we adopt the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model as the theoretical many-body framework to describe nuclear systems. We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the snowplow model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters for over Fifty Million stars from SMSS DR4 and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved with SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H] $\leq -1$) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3.0$) stars - representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/ and https://zenodo.org/records/15108911.</description>

      <title>The Type I Superluminous Supernova Catalogue II: Spectroscopic Evolution in the Photospheric Phase, Velocity Measurements, and Constraints on Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are among the most energetic explosions in the universe, reaching luminosities up to 100 times greater than those of normal supernovae. Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to reveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the largest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data from ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022. The dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing average phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures (10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation follows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading to stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe may contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly reduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than peak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain the same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion, suggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we identify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for energy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or more statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\lambda}5169 lines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits, indicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation between velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are in homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour aligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameters, extinction, and distances for stars in SMSS DR2 by SPar method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of large datasets containing stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for stars in the Milky Way, particularly within the Galactic disk, is essential for advancing our understanding of the Galaxy's stellar populations, structure, kinematics, and chemical evolution. In this study, we present a catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature (\teff), metallicity (\feh), absolute magnitudes ($M_{G}$), distances ($d$), and reddening values (\ebr), for a sample of 141 million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS). These parameters are derived using the SPar algorithm, which employs a fitting procedure to match multi-band photometric observations and estimate the stellar properties (\teff, \feh, $M_G$, $d$, and \ebr) on an individual star basis, following the methodology outlined in our previous work. This study successfully determines stellar parameters and extinction values simultaneously for stars located in high and low Galactic latitudes. The resulting stellar parameters and extinction values are in good agreement with results from other studies, demonstrating the robustness of our method. We derive a temperature dispersion of 195\,K and a metallicity dispersion of 0.31\,dex when comparing our results with spectroscopic data. The catalog produced in this work provides a valuable resource for future research on the Galactic metallicity distribution function, the structure of the Galaxy, three-dimensional extinction mapping, and other related astrophysical topics.</description>
