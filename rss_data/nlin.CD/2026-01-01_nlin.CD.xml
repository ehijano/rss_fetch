      <title>Identification of fixations and saccades in eye-tracking data using adaptive threshold-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic Control and Reprogramming-Induced Potential Landscapes of Gene Regulatory Networks: A Quantitative Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory framework to analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) incorporating epigenetic modifications. Building on the Hopfield network model analogy to spin glass systems, our approach introduces dynamic terms representing DNA methylation and histone modification to capture their regulatory influence on gene expression. The resulting formulation reduces high-dimensional GRN dynamics to effective stochastic equations, enabling the characterization of both stable and oscillatory states in epigenetically regulated systems. This framework provides a tractable and quantitative method for linking gene regulatory dynamics with epigenetic control, offering new theoretical insights into developmental processes and cell fate decisions.</description>

      <title>Beyond chaos: fluctuations, anomalies and spontaneous stochasticity in fluid turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this perspective, we consider the development of statistical hydrodynamics, focusing on the way in which the intrinsic stochasticity of turbulent phenomena was identified and is being explored. A major purpose of our discussion is to bring out the role of anomalies in turbulent phenomena, in ways that are not usually done, and to emphasize how the description of turbulent phenomena requires delicate considerations of asymptotic limits. The scope of our narrative includes selected historical aspects that are not usually emphasized, primarily due to G.I. Taylor, as well as discussions of certain aspects of the laminar-turbulent transition, the behaviour of turbulent drag at intermediate Reynolds numbers, and the statistics of fully-developed turbulence that exhibit spontaneous stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectral Analysis Through Pseudo-Resolvent Koopman Operator in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for spectral analysis of the Koopman operator based on direct construction of the pseudo-resolvent from time-series data. Finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator, such as those obtained from Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, are known to suffer from spectral pollution. To address this issue, we construct the pseudo-resolvent operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity whose norm serves as a spectral indicator, and pseudoeigenfunctions are extracted as directions of maximal amplification. We establish convergence of the approximate spectrum to the true spectrum in the Hausdorff metric for isolated eigenvalues, with preservation of algebraic multiplicities, and derive error bounds for eigenvalue approximation. Numerical experiments on pendulum, Lorenz, and coupled oscillator systems demonstrate that the method effectively suppresses spectral pollution and resolves closely spaced spectral components.</description>

      <title>A chaotic lattice field theory in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe spatiotemporally chaotic (or turbulent) field theories discretized over d-dimensional lattices in terms of sums over their multi-periodic orbits. `Chaos theory' is here recast in the language of statistical mechanics, field theory, and solid state physics, with the traditional periodic orbits theory of low-dimensional, temporally chaotic dynamics a special, one-dimensional case.
  In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no time evolution. Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system's defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit's Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Dynamical Systems Inspired by Montgomery's Conjecture: Insights into Zeta Function Zeros and Chaos in Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze a novel dynamical system inspired by Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture, modeling the spacings between nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function via the GUE kernel $g(u) = 1 - \left( \frac{\sin(\pi u)}{\pi u} \right)^2 + \delta(u)$. The recurrence $x_{n+1} = 1 - \left( \frac{\sin(\pi/x_n)}{\pi/x_n} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{x_n}$ emulates eigenvalue repulsion as a quantum operator analogue realizing the P\'olya-Hilbert conjecture.
  Bifurcation analysis and Lyapunov exponents reveal quantum-like chaos: near $x=0$, linearized dynamics $f(x) = 1 - \pi^2 x^2$ yield Gaussian Lyapunov function $V(x) = C_1 e^{-\pi^2 x^3/3}$ with LaSalle invariance bounding zeros in $[0,1]$; large $x$ exhibit exponential growth $\lambda_n \to \ln(\pi^2/6)$. Entropy analysis confirms GUE level repulsion with zero entropy for small initial conditions.
  Comparative validation against actual $\gamma_n$ achieves errors $&lt;10^{-100}$, while spectral density $\rho(E) \sim \frac{\log E}{2\pi}$ matches zeta zero statistics. This bridges Montgomery pair correlation to quantum chaos, providing computational evidence for Riemann zero spacing distributions and supporting the quantum operator hypothesis for $\zeta(1/2+it)$.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>
