      <title>Photosynthetic energy transfer: missing in action (detected spectroscopy)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, action-detected ultrafast spectroscopies have gained popularity. These approaches offer some advantages over their coherently-detected counterparts, enabling spatially-resolved and operando measurements with high sensitivity. However, there are also fundamental limitations connected to the different process of signal generation in action-detected experiments. Specifically, state mixing by nonlinear interactions during signal emission leads to a large static background which can obscure the excited-state dynamics. This could severely limit the applicability of action-detected spectroscopy to study energy transfer in larger systems. Here we perform fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) of the light-harvesting II (LH2) complex from purple bacteria. We demonstrate that the B800-B850 energy transfer process in LH2 is barely discernable in F-2DES, representing a ~6.2% rise of the lower cross-peak intensity. This is in stark contrast to measurements using coherently-detected 2DES where the lower cross-peak reveals energy transfer with 100% contrast. We explain the weak presence of excited-state dynamics using a disordered excitonic model with realistic experimental conditions. We further derive a general formula for the presence of excited-state signals in multi-chromophoric aggregates, dependent on the aggregate geometry and size, and the interplay of excitonic coupling and disorder. We find that, dependent on the excitonic state structure, the excited state dynamics in F-2DES can be visible even in large aggregates. Our work shows that the signatures of energy transfer in F-2DES can be used to directly infer the excitonic structure in multichromophoric systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling noisy herds</title>

Abstract: The wisdom of the crowd breaks down in small groups. While large flocks exhibit swarm intelligence to evade predators, small groups display erratic behavior, oscillating between unity and discord. We investigate these dynamics using small groups of sheep controlled by shepherd dogs in century-old sheepdog trials, proposing a two-parameter stochastic dynamic framework. Our model employs pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) to simulate herding and shedding behaviors. Light sheep rapidly achieve a stable herding state, while heavy sheep exhibit intermittent herding and orthogonal alignment to the dog. High response isotropy enhances group cohesion but complicates group splitting. We construct a unified phase diagram for sheep behavior, identifying three regimes (fleeing, flocking, and grazing) based on group size and stimulus specificity. Increasing stimulus specificity shifts small group behavior from grazing to fleeing, while larger groups exhibit flocking. This transition underscores the challenge of controlling small indecisive collectives. Introducing the Indecisive Collective Algorithm (ICA), we show that deliberate indecisiveness and stochasticity improve control efficiency. ICA outperforms traditional averaging-based algorithms in high-noise settings and excels in tasks requiring group splitting. Our study offers a foundational framework for controlling small, indecisive groups, applicable to biochemical reactions, cell populations, and opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling fibrous tissue in vascular fluid-structure interaction: a morphology-based pipeline and biomechanical significance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Microbiomes Through The Looking Glass</title>

Abstract: Bacterial communities are pivotal to maintaining ecological function and preserving the rich tapestry of biological diversity. The rapid development of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has revolutionized our capacity to probe such diversity. However, despite these advances, a theoretical understanding connecting empirical data with ecosystem modelling, in particular in the framework of disordered systems akin to spin glasses, is still in its infancy. Here, we present a comprehensive framework using theories of disordered systems to decode microbiome data, which offers insight into the ecological forces that shape macroecological states. By employing the quenched disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we analyze species abundance data in healthy and diseased human gut microbiomes. Results reveal the emergence of two distinct patterns of species-interaction networks, elucidating the pathways through which dysbiosis may drive microbiome instability. Interaction patterns thus provide a window into the systemic shifts accompanying the transition from health to disease, offering a new perspective on the dynamics of the microbial community. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered systems theory to characterize microbiomes by capturing the essence of ecological interactions and their consequences on stability and functioning, leveraging our understanding of the linkages of dysbiosis and microbial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and nonlinear dynamics of the follower force model for active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biofilament-motor protein complexes are ubiquitous in biology and drive the transport of cargo vital for many fundamental cellular processes. As they move, motor proteins exert compressive forces on the filaments to which they are attached, leading to buckling and a subsequent range of dynamics. The follower force model, in which a single compressive force is imposed at the filament tip, is the standard and most basic model for an elastic filament, such as a microtubule, driven by a motor protein. Depending on the force value, one can observe different states including whirling, beating and writhing, though the bifurcations giving rise to these states are not completely understood. In this paper, we utilise techniques from computational dynamical systems to determine and characterise these bifurcations. We track emerging time-periodic branches and identify new, quasiperiodic states. We investigate the effect of filament slenderness on the bifurcations and, in doing so, present a comprehensive overview of the dynamics which emerge in the follower force model.</description>

Abstract: Animals and robots must self-right on the ground after overturning. Biology research described various strategies and motor patterns in many species. Robotics research devised many strategies. However, we do not well understand how the physical principles of how the need to generate mechanical energy to overcome the potential energy barrier governs behavioral strategies and 3-D body rotations given the morphology. Here I review progress on this which I led studying cockroaches self-righting on level, flat, solid, low-friction ground, by integrating biology experiments, robotic modeling, and physics modeling.</description>

      <title>Energy transduction reconfigures the micro-viscoelasticity of striated muscle myosin solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-frequency micro-mechanical response of suspensions composed by cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin by optical trapping interferometry. We observe that in low ionic strength solutions upon the addition of magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP$^{2-}$), myosin suspensions radically change their micro-mechanics properties, generating a viscoelastic fluid characterized by a complex modulus analogous to a suspension of worm-like micelles. This transduction of energy, from chemical to mechanical, may be related to the relaxed states of myosin, which regulate muscle contractility and can be involved in the etiology of many myopathies. Within a similar generic mechanical response, cardiac and skeletal myosin suspensions provide different stress relaxation times, elastic modulus values, and characteristic lengths. These discrepancies probably rely on the dissimilar physiological functions of cardiac and skeletal muscle, on the different MgATPase hydrolysis rates of cardiac and skeletal myosins, and on the observed distinct cooperative behavior of their myosin heads in the super-relaxed state. \textit{In vitro} studies like these allow to understand the foundations of muscle cells mechanics on the micro-scale, and may contribute to the engineering of biological materials whose micro-mechanics can be activated by energy regulators.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>
