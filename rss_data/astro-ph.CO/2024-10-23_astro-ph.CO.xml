      <title>On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called "prior volume" phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to the priors used by D'Amico et al. (2019). We point out that in addition to the "prior volume" effect there is a much more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the "prior volume" effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that the analysis choices of D'Amico et al.~(2019), especially their scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to a negligible ($\lesssim 1\%$) bias in the recovery of cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.</description>

      <title>Modulations of Gravitational Waves due to Non-static Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a new observational window into the universe, providing insights into compact objects and cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing, commonly studied in electromagnetic waves, also affects GWs, introducing magnification, time delays, and multiple images. While existing studies focus on static lenses, many astrophysical lenses are dynamic, with time-varying mass distributions such as moving stars or orbiting binaries. We develop a general theoretical framework to describe non-static lenses and demonstrate how they modulate GW signals, inducing unique time-varying amplitude modulations and spectral broadening. By examining uniformly moving and orbiting binary lenses, we show that these modulations provide new observational signatures, enhancing our understanding of lensing objects and the dynamics of the universe. Our findings have important implications for GW astronomy, offering novel ways to probe lens dynamics and improve the interpretations of GW signals.</description>

      <title>Scalar one-loop tensor power spectrum during single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum and its cross-correlation with dark matter halos in different astrophysical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ forest, a series of HI absorption lines in the quasar spectra, is a powerful tool for probing the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium. Its three-dimensional (3D) correlation and cross-correlations with quasars allow precise measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature and redshift space distortions at redshifts $z&gt;2$. Understanding small-scale astrophysical phenomena, such as star formation and feedback, is crucial for full-shape analyses. In this study, we measure the 3D auto-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and its cross-power spectrum with halos using hydrodynamic simulations from the GADGET3-OSAKA code, which includes models for star formation and supernova feedback. Across five astrophysical models, we find significant deviations from the Fiducial model, with $5-10\,\%$ differences for wavenumbers $k&gt;2\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-power spectrum. The Ly$\alpha\,\times\,$halo cross-power spectra show even larger deviations, exceeding $10\,\%$ in some cases. Using the fitting models of Arinyo-i-Prats et al. (2015) and Givans et al. (2022), we jointly fit the Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$ $\times$ halo cross-power spectra, and assess the accuracy of the estimated $f\sigma_8$ parameter by comparing it with the ground truth from the simulations, while varying the maximum wavenumber $k_\mathrm{max}$ and minimum halo mass $M_h$. Our results demonstrate that the extended model of Givans et al. (2022) is highly effective in reproducing $f\sigma_8$ at $k_\mathrm{max}\leq3.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $M_h&gt;10^{10.5} M_\odot$, and remains robust against astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Cooling rate and turbulence in the intracluster medium of the cool-core cluster Abell 2667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the thermal X-ray emission from the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2667 ($z=0.23$). Our goal is to detect low-temperature ($&lt;2$ keV) X-ray emitting gas, potentially associated to a cooling flow that connects the hot ICM reservoir to the cold gas phase responsible for star formation and supermassive black hole feeding. We use new deep XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data, combined with archival Chandra data, to perform a spectral analysis for the core region. We find 1$\sigma$ upper limits to the cooling gas fraction of $\sim$40 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ and $\sim$50-60 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ in the temperature ranges 0.5-1 keV and 1-2 keV, respectively. The lack of OVII, FeXXI-FeXXII, and FeXVII emission lines in the RGS spectra suggest that the fraction of gas cooling below 1 keV is limited to a few tens of $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ at most. However, we detect several lines (e.g. SiXIV, MgXII, FeXXIII/FeXXIV, NeX, OVIII$\alpha$) that allow us to estimate a 1$\sigma$ upper limit for turbulent broadening of $\sim$320 km $\rm s^{-1}$, higher that other cool-core clusters such as Abell 1835, implying mechanisms that boost turbulence in Abell 2667's atmosphere. Imaging analysis of Chandra data suggests the presence of a cold front, possibly lined to sloshing or ICM cavities. However, current data do not clearly identify the physical mechanism driving turbulence. These finding indicate that Abell 2667 is similar to other low-redshift cool-core clusters, though the large upper limit on turbulence hints at significant ICM heating, which may suppress cooling for extended periods and contribute to future condensation events.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: Baryon effects on the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of baryon physics associated with galaxy formation onto the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe is a key uncertainty in the theoretical modelling required for the interpretation of Stage IV cosmology surveys. We use the FLAMINGO suite of simulations to study the baryon response due to galaxy formation of the total matter power spectrum. We find that it is only well converged for simulation volumes in excess of $(200~Mpc)^3$. We report results for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the z=0 stellar mass function, or shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of AGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator which can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than 1% up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h/Mpc$ and up to z=2 for all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the response becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the position of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift decreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a stronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally driven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses at fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We find only a small (1% at $k&lt;10~h/Mpc$) dependence of our results on the background cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed to confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback models is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing with external data. Such a response is, however, in strong tension with the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters used to calibrate the FLAMINGO model.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Neural Posterior Estimation for Strong Gravitational Lens Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Weyl-invariant quadratic Einstein-Cartan gravity coupled to a scalar field and study the inflationary behaviour of the coupled system of the scalar field and the pseudoscalar associated with the Holst invariant. We find that the model is characterized by effective single-field inflation occurring at small field values and analyze its predictions which are in comfortable agreement with existing observations for a range of parameter values.</description>

      <title>Is leptogenesis during gravitational reheating flavourful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of charged lepton Yukawa equilibration on leptogenesis during gravitational reheating. During the post-inflationary era, the inflaton field is assumed to oscillate around the minimum of a monomial potential, leading to the gravitational production of Standard Model (SM) particles, constituting the radiation bath. The heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), responsible for generating baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis, are also produced through graviton-mediated scattering of the homogeneous inflaton field and thermal bath, as well as from the the inverse decay of the bath particles. By considering both minimal and non-minimal gravitational contributions to SM, we demonstrate that flavour effects can be safely neglected in the minimal reheating scenario. However, with large non-minimal coupling, these effects may become important, depending on the choice of the RHN mass. We identify the corresponding viable parameter space that satisfies the observed baryon asymmetry in each case.</description>

      <title>Successful cogenesis of baryon and dark matter from memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) and dark matter (DM) from evaporating primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical regime incorporating the impact of memory burden. In the simplest scenario of baryogenesis via vanilla leptogenesis with hierarchical right handed neutrino (RHN), it is possible to generate the observed BAU with memory-burdened PBH being sole contributor to the production of RHN. While it is not possible to achieve cogenesis in this minimal setup due to structure formation constraints on relic allowed DM parameter space, we show the viability of successful cogenesis in the resonant leptogenesis regime. We also show that successful cogenesis can be achieved in a simple baryogenesis model without taking the leptogenesis route. Due to the possibility of generating asymmetry even below the sphaleron decoupling era, the direct baryogenesis route opens up new parameter space of memory-burdened PBH. The two scenarios of successful cogenesis can also be distinguished by observations of stochastic gravitational waves produced from PBH density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The power spectrum of galaxies from large to small scales: a line-intensity mapping perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the power spectrum of galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation when they are weighted by their star formation rate. Such a weighting is relevant in the context of line-intensity mapping (LIM). On intermediate to large scales, the model accounts for non-linear bias of star-forming galaxies and halo exclusion (a 2-halo term). On small scales, it incorporates the weighted distribution of satellite galaxies within haloes (a 1-halo term). The random sampling of satellite galaxies adds a shot noise term to the power spectrum on small scales, and their confinement to haloes introduces a halo shot noise term on large scales. The full model reproduces the measured power spectrum to within a few per cent on all scales, and the fitting parameters have a clear physical meaning. Omitting satellite galaxies from the analysis leads to an underestimation of both the large-scale bias and the mean LIM intensity by approximately 30 per cent each at redshift 1.5. Assigning the LIM intensity of satellites to the centre of their respective haloes affects the power spectrum on scales $k &gt; 0.3$ h Mpc$^{-1}$. We discuss how the LIM power spectrum can be used to constrain cosmology on large scales, and galaxy formation on smaller scales, with our fitting function providing an accurate and well-motivated parametrisation.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the LISA massive black hole binary population via iterative kernel density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the properties of the astrophysical population of binary compact objects in the universe is a key science goal of gravitational wave detectors. This goal is hindered by the finite strain, frequency sensitivity and observing time of current and future detectors. This implies that we can in general observe only a selected subset of the underlying population, with limited event statistics, and also nontrivial observational uncertainties in the parameters of each event. In this work, we will focus on observations of massive black hole binaries with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). If these black holes grow from population III star remnants (``light seeds''), a significant fraction of the binary population at low masses and high redshift will be beyond LISA's observational reach; thus, selection effects have to be accounted for when reconstructing the underlying population. Here we propose an iterative, kernel density estimation (KDE)-based non-parametric method, in order to tackle these statistical challenges in reconstructing the astrophysical population distribution from a finite number of observed signals over total mass and redshift. We test the method against a set of simulated LISA observations in a light seed formation scenario. We find that our approach is successful at reconstructing the underlying astrophysical distribution in mass and redshift, except in parameter regions where zero or order(1) signals are observed.</description>

      <title>Thermal evolution of dark matter in the early universe from a symplectic glueball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that dark matter could be a bound state of a strongly coupled non-Abelian gauge theory is theoretically appealing and has a variety of interesting phenomenological implications. In particular, an interpretation of dark matter as the lightest glueball state in the spectrum of a dark Yang-Mills theory, possibly coupled to the visible sector only through gravitational interactions, has been discussed quite extensively in the literature, but most of previous work has been focused on dark SU(N) gauge theories. In this article, we consider an alternative model, based on a symplectic gauge group, which has a first-order confinement/deconfinement phase transition at a finite critical temperature. We first determine the equation of state of this theory, focusing on temperatures close to the transition, and evaluating the associated latent heat. Then we discuss the evolution of this dark-matter model in the early universe, commenting on the mechanisms by which it could indirectly interact with the visible sector, on the spectrum of gravitational waves it could produce, and on the relic abundances it would lead to. Our discussion includes an extensive review of relevant literature, a number of comments on similarities and differences between our model and dark SU(N) gauge theories, as well as some possible future extensions of the present study.</description>

Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytical expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Turning to the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytical bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CL: Galaxy cluster detection in the SDSS with deep machine learning</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) Galaxy clusters are a powerful probe of cosmological models. Next generation large-scale optical and infrared surveys will reach unprecedented depths over large areas and require highly complete and pure cluster catalogs, with a well defined selection function. We have developed a new cluster detection algorithm YOLO-CL, which is a modified version of the state-of-the-art object detection deep convolutional network YOLO, optimized for the detection of galaxy clusters. We trained YOLO-CL on color images of the redMaPPer cluster detections in the SDSS. We find that YOLO-CL detects $95-98\%$ of the redMaPPer clusters, with a purity of $95-98\%$ calculated by applying the network to SDSS blank fields. When compared to the MCXC2021 X-ray catalog in the SDSS footprint,YOLO-CL is more complete then redMaPPer, which means that the neural network improved the cluster detection efficiency of its training sample. The YOLO-CL selection function is approximately constant with redshift, with respect to the MCXC2021 cluster mean X-ray surface brightness. YOLO-CL shows high performance when compared to traditional detection algorithms applied to SDSS. Deep learning networks benefit from a strong advantage over traditional galaxy cluster detection techniques because they do not need galaxy photometric and photometric redshift catalogs. This eliminates systematic uncertainties that can be introduced during source detection, and photometry and photometric redshift measurements. Our results show that YOLO-CL is an efficient alternative to traditional cluster detection methods. In general, this work shows that it is worth exploring the performance of deep convolution networks for future cosmological cluster surveys, such as the Rubin/LSST, Euclid or the Roman Space Telescope surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological bounds on sterile neutrino masses in the light of the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. We argue that non-zero masses for sterile neutrinos are inferred at 2$\sigma$ level in some extended models such as varying dark energy equation of state, when a direct measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and weak lensing measurement of dark energy survey (DES) are taken into account. Furthermore, the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions are also reduced in such a framework. We also consider the case where a non-flat Universe is allowed and show that a slightly open Universe may be favored in models with sterile neutrinos in the context of the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard rulers in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy models are regarded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and early dark energy models in new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicate a slightly longer sound horizon $r_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm for gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library $\texttt{pmwd}$, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on $\texttt{JAX}$. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent results on the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the DESI collaboration have shown tantalizing hints for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$, with a statistically significant deviation from the cosmological constant and cold dark matter $\Lambda$CDM model. One of the simplest and theoretically well-motivated plausible candidates to explain the observed behavior of $w(z)$, is scalar-field quintessence. Here, we consider a class of models known as $\alpha$-attractor, which describe in a single framework both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Using the recent DESI data, in conjunction with other cosmological observations, we place stringent constraints on $\alpha$-attractor models and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find the $\alpha$ parameter of the theory, which is physically motivated from supergravity and supersymmetry theories to have the values $3\alpha \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, is constrained to be $\alpha\simeq 1.89_{-0.35}^{+0.40}$. In addition, we find that the rest of the cosmological parameters of the model agree with the corresponding values of $\Lambda$CDM, while a bayesian analysis finds strong support in favor of the $\alpha$-attractor model. We also highlight an interesting connection between the $\alpha$-attractor models and the stochastic gravitational wave background, where a contribution to the latter could derive from an enhancement of inflationary gravitational waves at high frequencies due to an early kination phase, thus providing an interesting alternative way to constrain the theory in the near future.</description>

      <title>Correcting for Selection Biases in the Determination of the Hubble Constant from Time-Delay Cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars has been used to infer the Hubble constant. The primary systematic uncertainty for time-delay cosmography is the mass-sheet transform (MST), which preserves the lensing observables while altering the inferred $H_0$. The TDCOSMO collaboration used velocity dispersion measurements of lensed quasars and lensed galaxies to infer that mass sheets are present, which decrease the inferred $H_0$ by 8$\%$. Here, we test the assumption that the density profiles of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses are the same. We use a composite star-plus-dark-matter mass profile for the parent deflector population and model the selection function for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses. We find that a power-law density profile with an MST is a good approximation to a two-component mass profile around the Einstein radius, but we find that galaxy-galaxy lenses have systematically higher mass-sheet components than galaxy-quasar lenses. For individual systems, $\lambda_\mathrm{int}$ correlates with the ratio of the half-light radius and Einstein radius of the lens. By propagating these results through the TDCOSMO methodology, we find that $H_0$ is lowered by a further $\sim$3\%. Using the velocity dispersions from \citet{slacs9} and our fiducial model for selection biases, we infer $H_0 = 66\pm4 \ \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 1 \ \mathrm{(model \ sys)} \pm 2 \ \mathrm{(measurement \ sys)} \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the TDCOSMO plus SLACS dataset. The first residual systematic error is due to plausible alternative choices in modeling the selection function, and the second is an estimate of the remaining systematic error in the measurement of velocity dispersions for SLACS lenses. Accurate time-delay cosmography requires precise velocity dispersion measurements and accurate calibration of selection biases.</description>

Abstract: The CSC (cryogenic scintillating calorimeter) technology devoted to rare event searches is reaching the sensitivity level required for the hunt of dark matter-electron scatterings. Dark matter-electron interactions in scintillating targets are expected to stimulate the emission of single photons, each of energy equal to the target electronic band gap. The electronic band gap in scintillators like NaI/GaAs is of O(eV). The search for this signal can be done by an array of cryogenic light detectors with eV/sub-eV energy resolution. In this work, we describe the detection principle, the detector response and the envisioned detector design to search for dark matter interacting with electrons via the measurement of the scintillation light at millikelvin. First sensitivity projections are provided, which show the potential of this research.</description>

Abstract: An important application of next-generation wide-field radio interferometers is making high dynamic range maps of radio emission. Traditional deconvolution methods like CLEAN can give poor recovery of diffuse structure, prompting the development of wide-field alternatives like Direct Optimal Mapping and $m$-mode analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian method to infer the coefficients of a full-sky spherical harmonic basis for a drift-scan telescope with potentially thousands of baselines, that can precisely encode the uncertainties and correlations between the parameters used to build the recovered image. We use Gaussian constrained realizations (GCR) to efficiently draw samples of the spherical harmonic coefficients, despite the very large parameter space and extensive sky-regions of missing data. Each GCR solution provides a complete, statistically-consistent gap-free realization of a full-sky map conditioned on the available data, even when the interferometer's field of view is small. Many realizations can be generated and used for further analysis and robust propagation of statistical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the mathematical formalism of the spherical harmonic GCR-method for radio interferometers. We focus on the recovery of diffuse emission as a use case, along with validation of the method against simulations with a known diffuse emission component.</description>

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE$\nu$NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and $^{7}$Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of $\mathcal{O}$(eV) and exposures of $\mathcal{O}$(tonne-years), using CaWO$_{4}$ or Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantum backreaction in U(1) axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum backreaction due to a gauge field coupled to a pseudo-scalar field driving a slow-roll inflationary stage, the so-called axion inflation. The backreaction is evaluated for the first time using a gauge invariant approach, going to second order in perturbation theory, and taking into consideration inflaton fluctuations as well as scalar perturbations of the metric. Within our gauge-invariant, but observer-dependent approach, we naturally consider as physical observers the ones comoving with the inflaton field. Considering the effective expansion rate consequent to the gauge field's backreaction, we observe that the backreaction effect becomes significant quite rapidly, moving the system out of the perturbative regime and into what is often referred to as the strong backreaction regime. This behavior also applies to the parameter that dictates the production of the gauge fields. The space-time backreaction is mainly due to the helicity contribution within the region of validity of the perturbative regime. As a final result, we see that the evaluated backreaction goes in the direction of prolonging the inflationary period more compared to the scenarios previously studied.</description>

Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Merger Rate with Modified Gravity in Dark-Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11995</link>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark-matter spikes surrounding super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions, Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH-PBH and PBH-NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark-matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO-Virgo observations to constrain the parameters of the theory. In particular we find steeper dark-matter spike density profiles in the modified gravity scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models are found to be wider than by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results on the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties in making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result on PBH properties.</description>
