      <title>Particle Builder -- Learn about the Standard Model while playing against an AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Builder Online is a web-based education game designed for high school physics students. Students can play against an AI opponent or peers to familiarise themselves with the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The game is aimed at a high school level and tailored to the International Baccalaureate and the Australian Curriculum. Students from four schools in Canberra took pre/post-tests and a survey while completing a lesson where they played Particle Builder. Students' understanding of particle physics concepts improved significantly. Students found the game more enjoyable and effective than regular classroom lessons.</description>

      <title>Learn Like Feynman: Developing and Testing an AI-Driven Feynman Bot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feynman learning technique is an active learning strategy that helps learners simplify complex information through student-led teaching and discussion. In this paper, we present the development and usability testing of the Feynman Bot, which uses the Feynman technique to assist self-regulated learners who lack peer or instructor support. The Bot embodies the Feynman learning technique by encouraging learners to discuss their lecture material in a question-answer-driven discussion format. The Feynman Bot was developed using a large language model with Langchain in a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation framework to leverage the reasoning capability required to generate effective discussion-oriented questions. To test the Feynman bot, a controlled experiment was conducted over three days with fourteen participants. Formative and summative assessments were conducted, followed by a self-efficacy survey. We found that participants who used the Feynman Bot experienced higher learning gains than the Passive Learners' group. Moreover, Feynman Bot Learners' had a higher level of comfort with the subject after using the bot. We also found typing to be the preferred input modality method over speech, when interacting with the bot. The high learning gains and improved confidence with study material brought about by the Feynman Bot makes it a promising tool for self-regulated learners.</description>
