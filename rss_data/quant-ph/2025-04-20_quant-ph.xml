      <title>A Quantum of Learning: Using Quaternion Algebra to Model Learning on Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing computation and measurement operations on qubits. In turn, the derived model, serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then, leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance criteria, such as convergence conditions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic noise in macroscopic quantum spatial superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how random fluctuations in the magnetic field will jitter the paths of a matter-wave interferometer randomly, hence, decohere the quantum superposition. To create a large spatial superposition with nanoparticles, we envisage embedding a spin in a nanoparticle as a defect and applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field as in a Stern-Gerlach type experiment to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. Such matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, adjacent matter-wave interferometers can use entanglement features to test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. In particular, we will use white and flicker noise to study the decoherence and constrain the parameters keeping in mind ambient temperatures suitable for superconducting wires embedded on a chip. We will show that to obtain a tiny spatial superposition of a nanometer separation, $\Delta x \sim {\cal O} (10^{-9})$m and to minimize decoherence, $\Gamma\leq {\cal O}(\frac{\omega_0}{2\pi})$, where $\Gamma$ is the decoherence and $\omega_0$ is the frequency of the oscillator, we will need current fluctuations to be $\delta I/I\leq {\cal O}(10^{-8})$, which is not impossible to obtain in superconducting wire arrangements. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem in a matter-wave interferometer arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast.</description>

      <title>Quantum precursors to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in Floquet spin-$J$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem proves that the resonant tori of classical integrable Hamiltonians are broken when a non-integrable perturbation is introduced, whereas non-resonant tori are resilient and only get deformed for up to a finite value of the perturbative parameter. In this letter, we identify quantum precursors to the KAM theorem in one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians periodically perturbed by instantaneous kicks. After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging and charge state manipulation of NV centers by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum optics and optical coherence in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence encodes information about the correlations of the electromagnetic field. In combination with quantum optical approaches, it allows for the study of the correlations between photons. Since the pioneering papers of Glauber, studies of optical coherence have facilitated many fundamental insights into non-classical signatures of light emission processes, with wide applicability in modern quantum technologies. However, when it comes to the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the description has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we overcome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field correlations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we introduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics and strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation functions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field correlation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties of the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we develop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic field, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study the correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in atomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the correlations. Since the theory is generic, it can be extended to multi-time correlation functions of any order, and allows to consider the interaction of light with arbitrary material systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of a bosonic mode and a two-level system interacting with several reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a novel dissipative scheme, we have investigated the quantum dynamics of an oscillating system interacting with two reservoirs with different temperatures trough different time-dependent coupling functions. The reduced density matrix, quantum optical characteristic functions, and (quasi) distribution functions like Husimi, Glauber-Sudarshan and Wigner functions on the phase space of the oscillator are obtained. The problem has been generalized to the case where the oscillator is interacting with $n$ distinctive reservoirs, and a quantum current and an effective reservoir is introduced. Finally, the quantum dynamics of a two-level system interacting with two reservoirs has been investigated, and the exact reduced density matrix is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Clifford Noise Reduction: Theory, Simulations and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose several optimizations of the CliNR partial error correction scheme which implements Clifford circuits by consuming a resource state. Errors are corrected by measuring a sequence of Pauli operators that we refer to as the verification sequence. We first propose a global optimization algorithm searching for a verification sequence resulting in a low logical error rate using tabu search. Then, we introduce a proxy for the logical error rate which is easier to evaluate and we design a two-step optimization algorithm. First, a verification sequence minimizing the proxy is computed, then this sequence is refined by reintroducing the logical error rate. Finally, we identify a large group of automorphisms of the search space which preserve the proxy and we use this symmetry to reduce the size of the search space. This results in a 168 $\times$ (respectively 20,160 $\times$) reduction of the size of the search space for the optimization of verification sequences with three (respectively four) Pauli operators. Our numerical simulations for 20-qubit Clifford circuits with size 400 under the ion chain model show that our optimization algorithms improve the performance of CliNR by 25% and that the two-step optimization achieves the same results as the global optimization with 64% fewer evaluations of the logical error rate. Finally, we perform experiments on a 36-qubit trapped ion quantum computer, without mid-circuit measurements, showing that the CZNR variant of CliNR is at breakeven.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the standard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique, assessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings produced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not consistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Logical channels in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Non-local Observable on Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Dicke Superradiant Decay with Separable Coherent Spin States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Dicke superradiant decay from a fully inverted state can at all times be described by a positive statistical mixture of coherent spin states (CSS). Since CSS are separable, this implies that no entanglement is involved in Dicke decay. Based on this result, we introduce a new numerical quantum trajectory approach leading to low-entanglement unravelings. This opens up possibilities for large-scale numerical simulations of collective decay processes.</description>

Abstract: Based on the violation of Bell inequalities, we can verify quantum random numbers by examining the correlation between device inputs and outputs. In this paper, we derive the maximum quantum value of the parity-CHSH inequality for a three-qubit system, establishing a tight upper bound applicable to any quantum state. Simultaneously, the necessary constraints for achieving saturation are analyzed. Utilizing this method, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for certain states to violate the parity-CHSH inequality. Building upon our proposal, the relationship between the noise parameter and the certifiable randomness in a bipartite entangled state is probed. Furthermore, we derive a monogamy relationship between the average values of the parity-CHSH inequality associated with the reduced three-qubit density matrices of GHZ-class states comprising four qubits.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when some loss mode is measured either by photon number counting -- i.e., photon subtraction -- or heterodyne detection. These offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generation with Efficient CUDA-Q Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Adaptive Distribution Generator that leverages a quantum walks-based approach to generate high precision and efficiency of target probability distributions. Our method integrates variational quantum circuits with discrete-time quantum walks, specifically, split-step quantum walks and their entangled extensions, to dynamically tune coin parameters and drive the evolution of quantum states towards desired distributions. This enables accurate one-dimensional probability modeling for applications such as financial simulation and structured two-dimensional pattern generation exemplified by digit representations(0~9). Implemented within the CUDA-Q framework, our approach exploits GPU acceleration to significantly reduce computational overhead and improve scalability relative to conventional methods. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that our Quantum Walks-Based Adaptive Distribution Generator achieves high simulation fidelity and bridges the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical high-performance computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gas algorithms (LGA) are a class of algorithms including, in chronological order, binary lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA), integer lattice gas algorithms (ILGA) and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). They are largely used for simulating non-linear systems. Starting from 1-dimensional ILGA, we design an algorithm where we carry out a fraction of the possible collisions. These fractions are then adapted to reproduce LBM equilibrium distributions, resulting in an adaptive lattice gas algorithm (ALGA) that achieves the same simulation results of LBM. Considering this, we develop a quantum algorithm that involves a linear collision operator and capable of simulating the same phenomena, while still using a measurement and reinitialization procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductor chip manufacturing process is complex and lengthy, and potential errors arise at every stage. Each wafer contains numerous chips, and wafer bin maps can be generated after chip testing. By analyzing the defect patterns on these wafer bin maps, the steps in the manufacturing process where errors occurred can be inferred. In this letter, we propose an improved quantum Bayesian inference to accelerate the identification of error patterns on wafer bin maps, thereby assisting in chip yield analysis. We outline the algorithm for error identification and detail the implementation of improved quantum Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate the speed advantage of quantum computation over classical algorithms with a real-world problem, highlighting the practical significance of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Realizing exceptional points by Floquet dissipative couplings in thermal atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional degeneracies and generically complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems are at the heart of numerous phenomena absent in the Hermitian realm. Recently, it was suggested that Floquet dissipative coupling in the space-time domain may provide a novel mechanism to drive intriguing spectral topology with no static analogues, though its experimental investigation in quantum systems remains elusive. We demonstrate such Floquet dissipative coupling in an ensemble of thermal atoms interacting with two spatially separated optical beams, and observe an anomalous anti-parity-time symmetry phase transition at an exception point far from the phase-transition threshold of the static counterpart. Our protocol sets the stage for Floquet engineering of non-Hermitian topological spectra, and for engineering new quantum phases that cannot exist in static systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of Entanglement Growth in Dicke Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance describes an ensemble of $N$ permutationally invariant two-level systems collectively emitting radiation with a peak radiated intensity scaling as $N^2$. Although individual Dicke states are typically entangled, the density matrix during superradiant decay is a mixture of such states, raising the subtle question of whether the total state is entangled or separable. We resolve this by showing analytically that for all $N$, starting from the fully excited state, the collective decay preserves separability for all times. This answers a longstanding question on the role of entanglement in Dicke superradiance and underscores that, despite collective dissipation, separable states remain separable under these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast microwave-driven two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits with a transmon coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two qubit gates constitute fundamental building blocks in the realization of large-scale quantum devices. Using superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates have previously been implemented in different ways with each method aiming to maximize gate fidelity. Another important goal of a new gate scheme is to minimize the complexity of gate calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a high-fidelity two-qubit gate between two fluxonium qubits enabled by an intermediate capacitively coupled transmon. The coupling strengths between the qubits and the coupler are designed to minimize residual crosstalk while still allowing for fast gate operations. The gate is based on frequency selectively exciting the coupler using a microwave drive to complete a 2$\pi$ rotation, conditional on the state of the fluxonium qubits. When successful, this drive scheme implements a conditional phase gate. Using analytically derived pulse shapes, we minimize unwanted excitations of the coupler and obtain gate errors of $10^{-2}$ for gate times below 60~ns. At longer durations, our gate is limited by relaxation of the coupler. Our results show how carefully designed control pulses can speed up frequency selective entangling gates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information and the Curvature of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the second derivative of concurrence with respect to the coupling between two qubits, referred to as the curvature of entanglement (CoE). For a two-qubit quantum probe used to estimate the coupling constant appearing in a simple interaction Hamiltonian, we show that at certain times CoE = -QFI; these times can be associated with the concurrence, viewed as a function of the coupling parameter, being a maximum. We examine the time evolution of the concurrence of the eigenstates of the symmetric logarithmic derivative and show that, for both initially separable and initially entangled states, simple product measurements suffice to saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound when CoE = -QFI, while otherwise, in general, entangled measurements are required giving an operational significance to the points in time when CoE = -QFI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-spinning permanent ferromagnet is predicted to behave as a gyroscope at sufficiently low frequencies, which can be seen as a manifestation of the Einstein-de Haas effect. This yet unexplored regime has been recently proposed for ultrasensitive precession-based magnetometry and for atomic-like quantum stabilization of a levitated nanomagnet in a static field. Here, we observe signatures of gyroscopic effects in the rotational dynamics of a non-spinning permanent ferromagnet levitated in a superconducting trap. Specifically, we detect spin-rotation coupling between different librational modes, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. From our measurements, we can infer both the intrinsic angular momentum of the levitated magnet and its gyromagnetic $g$-factor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate picosecond-level synchronization of two actively mode-locked Ti:Sapphire lasers via the White Rabbit Precision Time Protocol (WR-PTP), tested over 120 km of deployed optical fiber. This synchronization capability, in combination with the highly single-mode, transform-limited pulses produced by each laser, enables their use as pump lasers for indistinguishable photon sources at remote locations in a quantum network. Here, the WR-PTP serves as a scalable network synchronization protocol, and its performance is compared to traditional methods of local synchronization. We demonstrate pulse-to-pulse synchronization better than 3 ps and time deviation (TDEV) values below 4 ps for all averaging times up to 10 s. With a designed coherence time of 35 ps for single photon sources utilizing these lasers, the achievable temporal overlap corresponds to 98 % Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility between independent sources.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a general decentralized framework for quantum kernel learning (QKL). It has robustness against quantum noise and can also be designed to defend adversarial information attacks forming a robust approach named RDQKL. We analyze the impact of noise on QKL and study the robustness of decentralized QKL to the noise. By integrating robust decentralized optimization techniques, our method is able to mitigate the impact of malicious data injections across multiple nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high accuracy under noisy quantum operations and effectively counter adversarial modifications, offering a promising pathway towards the future practical, scalable and secure quantum machine learning (QML).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional word-to-vector embeddings face challenges in representing polysemy, where word meaning is context-dependent. While dynamic embeddings address this, we propose an alternative framework utilizing quantum contextuality. In this approach, words are encoded as single, static vectors within a Hilbert space. Language contexts are formalized as maximal observables, mathematically equivalent to orthonormal bases. A word vector acquires its specific semantic meaning based on the basis (context) it occupies, leveraging the quantum concept of intertwining contexts where a single vector can belong to multiple, mutually complementary bases. This method allows meaning to be constructed through orthogonality relationships inherent in the contextual structure, potentially offering a novel way to statically encode contextual semantics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous article, we presented a quantum-inspired framework for modeling semantic representation and processing in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing upon mathematical tools and conceptual analogies from quantum mechanics to offer a new perspective on these complex systems. In this paper, we clarify the core assumptions of this model, providing a detailed exposition of six key principles that govern semantic representation, interaction, and dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable insights into their information processing and response generation, and we further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.</description>

It is used to determine a promising parameter regime for operating topological qubits. The protocol's key metric is the probability of incorrectly identifying a trivial region as topological, referred to as the false discovery rate (FDR). Two recent manuscripts [arXiv:2502.19560, arXiv:2503.08944] engage with the topological gap protocol and its use in Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Subsection S4.3 of the Supplementary Information for Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), although they do not explicitly dispute the main results of either one. We demonstrate that the objections in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944 are unfounded, and we uphold the conclusions of Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). Specifically, we show that no flaws have been identified in our estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). We provide a point-by-point rebuttal of the comments in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Phase Control of an Optical Lattice with up to 50 dB Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the standing-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and manipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum simulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices are flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with modifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control functions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude with Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation bandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of overlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and intensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase controller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical reference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination of the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as the beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in lattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression spanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute phase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\r{A} over 10 s. This method permits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice intensity and phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by executing intricate time-varying phase profiles for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroad resonance of localized plasmon on a nanoparticle coupled with surface plasmon on a nanowire enabling two-photon excited emission via continuous-wave laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study found that plasmonic hotspots (HSs) between silver nanoparticles (NPs) and silver nanowires (NWs) generated two-photon excited emissions, including hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules with continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor (FR) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of FR to the gap distance at the HSs. We also experimentally and theoretically investigated the propagation of two-photon-excited emission light to a neighboring NP on the NW via surface plasmons.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Pseudo-Null Induced by Light in an Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a linear radio-frequency (rf) ion trap, the rf null is the point of zero electric field in the dynamic trapping potential where the ion motion is approximately harmonic. When displaced from the rf null, the ion is superimposed by fast oscillations known as micromotion, which can be probed through motion-sensitive light-atom interactions. In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudo-null, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudo-null manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion. The true rf null occurs uniquely at the concurrent point of the pseudo-null lines induced by different light sources.</description>

      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Landscape of Quantum Information Science and Engineering Education: From Physics Foundations to Interdisciplinary Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining interest from those within many disciplines and higher education needs to adapt to the changing landscape. Although QISE education still has a strong presence and roots in physics, the field is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. There is a need to understand the presence of QISE instruction and quantum-related instruction across all disciplines in order to figure out where QISE education is already happening and where it could be expanded. Although there is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no holistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the United States. We analyzed course catalogs from 1,456 U.S. institutions. We found 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at PhD-granting schools, with physics, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and computer science(CS) as their primary contributors . Across all institutions, we identified over 8,000 courses mentioning 'quantum,' but about one-third of institutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE courses, concentrated in PhD-granting institutions, primarily in physics, ECE, and CS. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related ($\sim$4,700) and QISE-specific ($\sim$200) courses. Across multiple disciplines, we see that QISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which may be a productive strategy for increasing access to QISE education. Our dataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum education across US higher education. To ensure broad access, all data are publicly available and downloadable at quantumlandscape.streamlit.app. We hope these findings will support and guide future efforts in curriculum design, workforce development, and education policy across the quantum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The relativity of color perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for optically inducing, controlling, and probing spin states in moir\'e systems. In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moir\'e bilayers. Furthermore, we establish direct connections between the resulting spin correlations and experimentally observable optical signals. Our work paves the way for future studies on the optical control and detection on strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing string breaking dynamics in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical aspects of string breaking in a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions. Using Tensor Network simulations, we demonstrate that the static potential as well as the site-resolved configuration of the matter sites and gauge links allows us to identify the regimes in which string breaking occurs. Furthermore, we develop a variational quantum eigensolver that allows for reliably preparing the ground state of the theory in both the absence and presence of static charges and to capture the static aspects of the phenomenon. Carrying out state preparation on real quantum hardware for up to 19 qubits, we demonstrate its suitability for current quantum devices. In addition, we study the real-time dynamics of a flux tube between two static charges using both Tensor Networks and quantum hardware. Using a trotterization for the time-evolution operator, we are able to show that the breaking process starts with the creation of charges inside the string. These eventually redistribute towards the static charges and screen them, which leads to the breaking of the flux tube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: The optical responses of solids are typically understood to be local in space. Whether locality holds for the optical response of a macroscopic quantum system has, however, been largely unexplored. Here, we use multidimensional coherent spectroscopy at the optical diffraction limit to demonstrate nonlocal optical nonlinearities in a semiconductor microcavity. These nonlocal optical responses are both coherent and quantum in nature, deriving from the macroscopic length scale of confined exciton-polariton wavefunctions.</description>

Abstract: The formalism of Quantum Mechanics is derived from the application of Bayesian probability theory to "fragile" systems, i.e. systems that are perturbed by the act of measurement. Complex Hilbert spaces, non-commuting operators and the trace rule for expectations all arise naturally from the use of linear algebra to solve integral equations involving classical probabilities over hidden variables. We comment on the case of non-local hidden variables, where violations of Bell's theorem can be produced, as well as the non-fragile limit of the theory, where all measurements are commutative and the theory becomes analogous to classical statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: For photo-dissociation of a single hydrogen molecule (H2) with combined XUV and IR laser pulses, we demonstrate optical control of the emission direction of the photoelectron with respect to the outgoing neutral fragment (the H-atom). Depending on the relative delay between the two laser fields, adjustable with sub-femtosecond time resolution, the photoelectron is emitted into the same hemisphere as the H-atom or opposite. This emission asymmetry is a result of entanglement of the two-electron final-state involving the spatially separated bound and emitted electron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saddle points constitute a crucial challenge for first-order gradient descent algorithms. In notions of classical machine learning, they are avoided for example by means of stochastic gradient descent methods. In this work, we provide evidence that the saddle points problem can be naturally avoided in variational quantum algorithms by exploiting the presence of stochasticity. We prove convergence guarantees and present practical examples in numerical simulations and on quantum hardware. We argue that the natural stochasticity of variational algorithms can be beneficial for avoiding strict saddle points, i.e., those saddle points with at least one negative Hessian eigenvalue. This insight that some levels of shot noise could help is expected to add a new perspective to notions of near-term variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Chemically Motivated Simulation Problems are Efficiently Solvable by a Quantum Computer</title>

Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially with the size of the system. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck , thanks to their capability of representing this amount of information efficiently. Most efforts so far have been centered around determining the ground states of chemical systems. However, hardness results and the lack of theoretical guarantees for efficient heuristics for initial-state generation shed doubt on the feasibility. Here, we propose a heuristically guided approach that is based on inherently efficient routines to solve chemical simulation problems, requiring quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states for dynamics simulation by assembling them in a scattering tree. In particular, we investigate a scattering-based state preparation approach within the context of mergo-association. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured after the quantum simulation of a process, e.g., a reaction, following its corresponding initial state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Unification of Finite Symmetries in Simulation of Many-body Systems on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental in the description and simulation of quantum systems. Leveraging symmetries in classical simulations of many-body quantum systems can results in significant overhead due to the exponentially growing size of some symmetry groups as the number of particles increases. Quantum computers hold the promise of achieving exponential speedup in simulating quantum many-body systems; however, a general method for utilizing symmetries in quantum simulations has not yet been established. In this work, we present a unified framework for incorporating symmetry group transforms on quantum computers to simulate many-body systems. The core of our approach lies in the development of efficient quantum circuits for symmetry-adapted projection onto irreducible representations of a group or pairs of commuting groups. We provide resource estimations for common groups, including the cyclic and permutation groups. Our algorithms demonstrate the capability to prepare coherent superpositions of symmetry-adapted states and to perform quantum evolution across a wide range of models in condensed matter physics and \textit{ab initio} electronic structure in quantum chemistry. Specifically, we execute a symmetry-adapted quantum subroutine for small molecules in first-quantization on noisy hardware. In addition, we present a discussion of open problems regarding treating symmetries in digital quantum simulations of many-body systems, paving the way for future systematic investigations into leveraging symmetries \emph{quantumly} for practical quantum advantage. The broad applicability and rigorous resource estimation for symmetry transformations make our framework appealing for achieving provable quantum advantage on fault-tolerant quantum computers, especially for symmetry-related properties.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how local distinguishability can restrict global properties of bi-partite states. We begin exploring how non-locality becomes limited by optimal local state discrimination and observe a non-trivial trade-off between the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation and success probability of local discrimination. We extend our findings to bounding the maximally entangled sate fidelity and global observables such as the energy. Our results show that optimal local state discrimination can become a powerful tool to limit global behaviours, e.g. from entangled adversaries in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality-Assisted Enhancement of Error-Free Communication in Noisy Classical Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The zero-error capacity of a noisy classical channel quantifies its ability to transmit information with absolute certainty, i.e., without any error. Unlike Shannon's standard channel capacity, which remains unaffected by pre-shared correlations, zero-error capacity can be enhanced through nonlocal correlations. In this work, we investigate zero-error communication utility of such correlations arising in the 2-2-m Bell scenario, where two parties have two inputs and m possible outcomes per input. For all m\geq2, we construct examples of noisy classical channels with zero zero-error capacity that, when assisted by extremal 2-2-m nonlocal correlations, can transmit one bit of information. While nonlocal correlations arising from quantum entangled states cannot achieve a positive zero-error capacity for these channels, they significantly enhance the probability of successfully transmitting a classical bit in a single use. Extending this analysis to the 2-m-2 Bell scenario, we identify channels with zero zero-error capacity that can nonetheless perfectly transmit log m bits of information when assisted by corresponding extremal nonlocal correlations. Our findings underscore the versatile utility of Bell nonlocal correlations in achieving zero-error communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations and metrological advantage among Unruh-DeWitt detectors in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing debate on Gibbons-Hawking (GH) decoherence centers on its unclear thermal nature. In this work, we investigate the robustness of quantum Fisher information (QFI) and local quantum uncertainty (LQU) in the presence of GH decoherence, using free-falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors in de Sitter spacetime (dS-ST). The UDW detectors interact with a massless scalar field in dS-ST and are modeled as open quantum systems, with the field acting as the environment for which we use a master equation to describe their evolution. Our analysis investigates the roles of energy spacing, GH temperature, initial state preparation, and various de Sitter-invariant vacuum sectors on the optimization of QFI and LQU. We find that the optimal values of QFI and LQU depend on the selected de Sitter-invariant vacuum sector and increase with larger energy spacing. Our findings reveal that QFI exhibits resilience to GH decoherence, maintaining a pronounced local peak across a wider range of parameters. This robustness can be further enhanced through strategic initial state preparation and increased energy spacing, resulting in a higher maximum QFI value even under significant environmental decoherence. Our results underscore the critical role of GH thermality in governing QFI and LQU, offering valuable insights for advances in relativistic quantum metrology (RQM).</description>

      <title>Effects of noise-induced coherence on the performance of a four-level laser heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of noise-induced coherence on the performance analysis of a degenerate four-level quantum heat engine with particular focus on the universal nature of efficiency, which refers to the appearance of the first two universal terms $\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C^2/8$ in series expansion of the efficiency at maximum power under a left-right symmetry in the system. Firstly, for a two-parameter optimization scheme, we derive an analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum power for the near-equilibrium condition and show that presence of noise-induced coherence breaks the left-right symmetry of the system. However, when the operation of the engine is restricted to either high-temperature or low-temperature regime, we discuss the conditions under which the left-right symmetry can be retained in each case, giving rise to the universal characteristic of efficiency. In case of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the first linear term $\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all conditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the constraints imposed on the control parameters. Finally, we examine the behavior of power as a function of noise-induced coherence parameter highlighting the role of matter-field coupling in determining the suitable operation regime for the heat engine to reap the benefits of noise-induced coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we study the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application for the Ising model as a test bed model, in which we pivotally delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then we proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QN-SPSA+PSR which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QN-SPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The QN-SPSA+PSR method integrates the QN-SPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQAs's optimization subroutine, even in Quantum Machine Learning's optimization section, and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, in which we utilized the properties of the investigated model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-entanglement-assisted telescopy protocol have been proposed and studied as a means to extend the baseline of optical interferometric telescopes. However, determining the optimality of these quantum-assisted protocols remains an open question. Here we introduce a noval framework for systematically characterizing different entanglement-assisted telescopy protocols by integrating tools from quantum metrology with the superselection rule (SSR) from quantum information theory. In our approach, the estimation of interference fringes is rigorously quantified using the quantum Fisher information under the SSR constraint. This approach defines the fundamental limits of astronomical estimation problems with finite entanglement resources, and building on this foundation, we propose new entanglement-assisted protocols that outperform previously known methods. Moreover, we show that these protocols are compatible with linear optical technology and could potentially inspire the development of improved quantum telescopy schemes for near-term, lossy, repeater-less quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Fine-Tuning of Neural Quantum States Enables Detection of Phase Transitions in Weight Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful tool for approximating quantum wavefunctions using deep learning. While these models achieve remarkable accuracy, understanding how they encode physical information remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce adiabatic fine-tuning, a scheme that trains NQS across a phase diagram, leading to strongly correlated weight representations across different models. This correlation in weight space enables the detection of phase transitions in quantum systems by analyzing the trained network weights alone. We validate our approach on the transverse field Ising model and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that phase transitions manifest as distinct structures in weight space. Our results establish a connection between physical phase transitions and the geometry of neural network parameters, opening new directions for the interpretability of machine learning models in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as a $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the continuous quantum measurement of gravitational radiation. This is typically done by coupling the radiation to a meter, such as a resonant mass detector or an interferometer, which is subsequently read out by a detector. We find that the detector employed determines whether the gravitational field exhibits wave or particle characteristics. A linear detector, such as a homodyne detector, yields no signal for a field in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude of a field in a coherent state. Such a linear detector thus supports a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton, resulting in a quantum jump in energy equal to the energy of the absorbed graviton. Our results extend the principle of complementarity to quantized gravitational radiation, demonstrating the detector dependence of the graviton, and indicates that conceptually simple modifications to gravitational-wave detectors can make them graviton counters.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory from classical mechanics near equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>

      <title>Collective optical properties of moir\'e excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.</description>

      <title>PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel PennyLane-Centric Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in code generation, natural language processing, and domain-specific reasoning. However, their application in quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for PennyLane-a leading framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples and contextual descriptions, specifically curated to support LLM training and fine-tuning for quantum code assistance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic construction and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset derived from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) a structured methodology for data curation, annotation, and formatting to enhance LLM usability and relevance; and (3) a rigorous evaluation of code generation capabilities using both baseline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a GraphRAG-enhanced pipeline. Using the PennyLang framework, we demonstrate that GraphRAG, when applied to a GPT-4o Mini model, substantially outperforms standard prompting and baseline RAG. Accuracy improves from 20.5% (without RAG) to 58.2% with GraphRAG, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving code correctness in quantum programming tasks. Compared to prior efforts focused largely on Qiskit, our work expands LLM-based assistance to the PennyLane ecosystem, contributing practical tools and reproducible methodologies for advancing AI-assisted quantum software development.</description>

      <title>$q$-Differential Operators for $q$-Spinor Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a \emph{q}-differential operator adapted to \emph{q}-spinor variables, establishing a corresponding \emph{q}-spinor chain rule and defining both standard and Dirac-type \emph{q}-differential operators. Integral formulas in \emph{q}-spinor variables are derived, and applications to \emph{q}-deformed spinor differential equations are explored through explicit examples. The framework extends existing \emph{q}-calculus to spinorial structures, offering potential insights into quantum deformations of relativistic field equations. We conclude with suggestions for future developments, including a \emph{q}-analogue of the Dirac--Maxwell algebra.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Creation in Condensed Matter: A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Money-Debt Dynamics in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework that models money-debt dynamics in economic systems through a direct analogy to particle-hole creation in condensed matter physics. In this formulation, issuing credit generates a symmetric pair-money as a particle-like excitation and debt as its hole-like counterpart-embedded within a monetary vacuum field. The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use. This approach provides physicists with a rigorous and intuitive toolset to analyze economic behavior using many-body theory, laying the groundwork for a new class of models in econophysics and interdisciplinary field analysis.</description>
