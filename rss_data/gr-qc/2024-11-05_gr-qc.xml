      <title>Impact of Charge on the Stability of Pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 in Modified Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effect of charge on the stability of pulsar star SAX J1748.9-2021 in $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ represents non-metricity. For this purpose, we apply the Krori-Barua metric ansatz with anisotropic fluid and use a linear $f(Q)$ model $f(Q)=\zeta Q$, where $\zeta$ is a non-zero constant. We derive exact relativistic solutions of the corresponding field equations. Furthermore, we study its geometric and physical properties through astrophysical observations from the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021, which is found in X-ray binary systems within globular clusters. We examine features like anisotropic pressure, the mass-radius relationship, redshift, the Zeldovich condition, energy and causality conditions, the adiabatic index, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, the equation of state parameter and compactness. Our findings align with the observational data which indicate that the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 is viable and stable under this modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Black Hole Solution in Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$ Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a cylindrical black hole (BH) introduced by Lemos (Phys. Lett. {\bf B 353}, 46 (1995)), in the context of modified gravity theories. Specifically, we focus on Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) and $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity theories and investigate Lemos black hole (LBH). To achieve this, we consider different classes of models in Ricci-Inverse gravity defined as follows: (i) Class-\textbf{I} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A})=(\mathcal{R}+\beta\,\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-\textbf{II} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, and (iii) Class-\textbf{III} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\, \mathcal{R}^2+ \alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+\beta_1\,\mathcal{A}+\beta_2\,\mathcal{A}^2+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, where $\mathcal{A}=g_{\mu\nu}\,A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature scalar, $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the Ricci tensor, $R_{\mu\nu}$. We solve the modified field equations incorporating zero energy-momentum tensor in all Classes of models, and obtain the result. Moreover, we consider $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity framework, where $f(\mathcal{R})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\,\mathcal{R}^2 +\alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+ \alpha_3\,\mathcal{R}^4+ \alpha_4\,\mathcal{R}^5)$ and $f(\mathcal{R})=\mathcal{R}+ \alpha_k\,\mathcal{R}^{k+1}$,\quad $(k=1,2,...n)$, and study this LBH. Subsequently, we study the geodesic motions of test particles around this LBH within the Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$gravity and analyze the outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that geodesics motions are influenced by these modified gravity and changes the results in comparison to general relativity case</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes in Cosmology from Colliding Light Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spacetime of colliding electromagnetic (em) waves transforms into near horizon geometry (NHG) of an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (BH), suggesting that upon collision pure light beams can produce BHs. Due to the quantum restrictions such BHs can have horizon radii in the range $R&gt;10^{8}m$. These electromagnetic BHs are accompanied by impulsive gravitational waves to be instrumental in their detection. If such BHs do exist this may open a new frontier in our understanding of BHs. In poetic words: Let there be light, to collide and create holes that are not white!</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Viscous Dark Energy in f(Q,C) Gravity: Two-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cosmological evolution of a viscous dark energy model within the framework of $f(Q, C)$ gravity, utilizing a two-fluid approach. The model incorporates non-metricity and boundary contributions to the total action, represented by the scalar quantities $Q$ and $C$. The viscosity in the dark energy fluid is modeled to understand the impact of bulk viscosity on cosmic expansion and the late-time acceleration of the universe. We derive the field equations using the modified FLRW metric and analyze the behavior of key cosmological parameters, including the energy density, pressure, and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The effective EoS parameter is also studied in the context of cosmic evolution. We impose observational constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using recent datasets from DESI-Y1, SDSS-IV, Pantheon+ (without SHOES calibration), and cosmic chronometer measurements. The analysis shows that the model effectively describes the universe's expansion history and predicts a transition from deceleration to acceleration, consistent with observational data. This model also provides an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without the need for a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon and Schr\"{o}dinger solutions in Lovelock quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of wave functions to explore various solutions of the Klein-Gordon and Schr\"{o}dinger equations within the framework of Lovelock gravity. We also present the derived Smarr formula from the topological density. The Klein-Gordon solution leads to the Wheeler-de Witt Hamiltonian and quasinormal modes, and we demonstrate the connection between the potential and the black hole temperature within the Schwarzschild limit. Additionally, we discuss different solutions of the Schr% \"{o}dinger equation, with one solution highlighting the influence of the Airy solution on the wave function's evolution over time.</description>

      <title>Masking equation of state effects in binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent nonmagnetized studies of binary neutron star mergers have indicated the possibility of identifying equation of state features, such as a phase transition or a quark-hadron crossover, based on the frequency shift of the main peak in the postmerger gravitational wave spectrum. By performing a series of general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations we show that similar frequency shifts can be obtained due to the effect of the magnetic field. The existing degeneracy can either mask or nullify a shift due to a specific equation of state feature, and therefore the interpretation of observational data is more complicated than previously thought, requiring a more complete treatment that would necessarily include the neutron star's magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars: Effect of the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior, and "pulsar-like": dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different initial magnetic field strengths. We find that the magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular momentum loss. This causes the remnant to contract and the angular velocity of the quadrupole density oscillation to increase in such a way that it rotates faster than the fluid itself, in stark contrast with nonmagnetized simulations. As a result, the $f_2$ frequency of the dominant postmerger GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to ~ 200Hz for the strongest magnetic field we consider and ~ 50Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Modified Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Models on the Existence of Stellar Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the existence of spherically symmetric strange quark configurations coupled with anisotropic fluid setup in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this regard, we adopt two models such as \emph{(i)} $f(\mathcal{G})=\beta\mathcal{G}^2$, and \emph{(ii)} $f(\mathcal{G})=\delta_{1}\mathcal{G}^{x}(\delta_{2}\mathcal{G}^{y}+1)$, and derive the field equations representing a static sphere. We then introduce bag constant in the gravitational equations through the use of MIT bag model, so that the quarks' interior can be discussed. Further, we work out the modified equations under the use of Tolman IV ansatz to make their solution possible. Junction conditions are also employed to find the constants involved in the considered metric potentials. Afterwards, different values of model parameters and bag constant are taken into account to graphically exploring the resulting solutions. This analysis is done by considering five strange quark objects like Her X-I, LMC X-4, 4U 1820-30, PSR J 1614-2230, and Vela X-I. Certain tests are also applied on the developed models to check their physical feasibility. It is much interesting that this modified gravity under its both considered functional forms yield physically viable and stable results for certain parametric values.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Hole in Galaxies Surrounded by a Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution describing a static and asymptotically flat BH surrounded by a dark matter (DM) halo with a Dehnen-type density distribution in the surrounding environment. We investigate the properties of the obtained BH by studying the curvature properties and energy conditions in Einstein gravity. Furthermore, we explore the features of a novel Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a DM halo with Dehnen-type density profile by analyzing the timelike geodesics of particles along with BH observable properties.</description>

      <title>A new representation of vacuum Lovelock solutions in $d = 2N+1$ dimensions: Black holes with an integrable singularity and regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, black hole (BH) solutions with an integrable singularity have garnered significant attention as alternatives to regular black holes (RBH). In these models, similarly to RBHs, an object would not undergo spaghettification when approaching the radial origin. Instead of the potentially unstable de Sitter core present in RBHs, an integrable singularity emerges where the Ricci scalar diverges while its volume integral remains finite.
  However, the construction of both RBH solutions and BHs with an integrable singularity typically requires the inclusion of specific forms of matter in the energy-momentum tensor. We demonstrate that, from a geometric perspective in the absence of matter, vacuum solutions in Lovelock gravity in $d=2n+1$ dimensions can be represented as vacuum BHs with an integrable singularity in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory for $d=5$ and in cubic gravity for $d=7$. Meanwhile, the vacuum solution in quartic gravity is described as a vacuum RBH with a nontrivial hyperboloidal cross-section.
  For all the aforementioned cases, we have determined the conditions that the parameters in the solutions must satisfy. Remarkably, in all discussed cases, there is no presence of an internal horizon near a potentially unstable de Sitter core.</description>

      <title>Static spheres and Aschenbach effect for black holes in massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectories of massive and massless particles in four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in dRGT massive gravity theory via phase-plane analysis and point out several novel features. In particular, we show the existence of a static sphere, a finite radial distance outside the black holes in these theories, where a massive particle can be at rest, as seen by an asymptotic zero angular momentum observer. Topological arguments show that the stable and unstable static spheres, which come in pairs, have opposite charges. In the presence of angular momentum, we first study the behaviour of massless particles and find the presence of stable and unstable photon spheres in both neutral and charged black holes. Subsequently, we study the motion of massive test particles around these black holes, and find one pair of stable and unstable time-like circular orbits (TCOs), such that the stable and unstable TCO's are disconnected in certain regions. Computing the angular velocity $\Omega_{\text{\tiny CO}}$ of the TCOs, measured by a static observer at rest, shows the unusual nature of its monotonic increase with the radius of TCO, near the location of stable photon sphere. This confirms the existence of Aschenbach effect for spherically symmetric black holes in massive gravity, which was only found to exist in rapidly spinning black holes, with the only other exception being the rare example of gravity coupled to quasi-topological electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Boson Stars as Gravitational Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a gravitational bounded cloud of generic bosons or a boson star in the non-relativistic regime, assuming from the very beginning that the boson star is in a Bose-Einstein condensed state. Also, we have taken into account multi-particle interactions within the boson star, which are described through the so-called logarithmic potential. Assuming energy conservation conditions at any time, we are able to describe the boson star as a some kind of gravitational quantum liquid, or more specifically, as a macroscopic gravitational quantum droplet. The assumption of logarithmic interactions, lead us to establish several scenarios in which the system is able to oscillates around the equilibrium radius. The approach analyzed in the present report shows that the interpretation of a boson star as a macroscopic gravitational quantum droplet can be applied to the dynamics analysis of a large number of systems on different size scales.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study first- and second-order electromagnetic perturbations in Schwarzschild spacetime, deriving effective source terms for the second-order Regge-Wheeler equation, which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations, in parallel with results from [1]. In addition to the induced mixed-quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies $\omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_G}{2}$ and $\Omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_{EM}}{2}$, resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at $\Omega^{(2)} = -i \frac{V_{EM} + V_G}{2}$. This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. For the first-order perturbations, we reduce the perturbation of a point charge source to a one-dimensional path integral. Using the Dirac delta approximation, we investigated the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge $q$ and radial dipole moment $p = q \eta$, employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Finally, we comment on the limitations of the Dirac delta approximation used in this analysis. This approach overlooks centrifugal effects,subsequently fail to recover the minkowski limit, resulting in an unrealistic spatial behavior. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Is bouncing easier with a negative effective dark fluid density ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that a cosmological model can describe the whole Universe history, we look for the conditions of a cosmological bounce thus in agreement with late time observations. Our approach involves casting such a theory into General Relativity with curvature ($\Omega_{\kappa}$), matter ($\Omega_{m}$), radiation ($\Omega_{r}$) and an effective dark fluid ($\Omega_{d}$) and formulating the corresponding field equations as a 2D dynamical system, wherein phase space points corresponding to extrema of the metric function are constrained by observational data. We show that if this effective dark fluid density is positive at the bounce, these observational constraints imply its occurrence in the future at a redshift $z&lt;-0.81$ whatever the cosmological model (dark energy, brane, $f(R)$, etc.) corresponding to this effective dark fluid and even with a positive curvature. Hence, the effective dark fluid density must be negative at the bounce such as it arises for $z&gt;-0.81$ and thus possibly in the past. Observations also impose that the dark fluid effective density can change sign only within the redshift range $0.54&lt;z&lt;0.61$. We then proceed by examining 3 cosmological models: a non linear dark fluid model, a Randall Sundrum brane model and a $f(R)=R+mR^n+\Lambda$ model. For each of them, we examine the conditions for (1) a bounce at early time, (2) with a negative effective dark fluid energy density, (3) this having to change sign within the above specified redshift interval. We find that none of these three models satisfy all three constraints. We conclude that while a negative effective dark fluid energy density required by observational constraints for a bounce at early times facilitates this bounce, the requirement for $\Omega_d$ to change sign and become positive within the above specified narrow redshift interval proves exceedingly challenging to satisfy these same constraints.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we calculate the reheating temperature in the cosmological scenarios where heavy scalar particles are gravitationally produced, due to a conformally coupled interaction between a massive scalar quantum field and the Ricci scalar, during the oscillations of the inflaton field. We explore two distinct cases, namely the one in which these particles decay during the domination of the inflaton's energy density and the other one where the decay occurs after this phase. For each scenario, we have derived formulas to calculate the reheating temperatures based on the energy density of the produced particles and their decay rate. We establish bounds for the maximum reheating temperature, defined as the temperature reached by the universe when the decay of gravitationally produced particles concludes at the onset of the radiation-dominated epoch. Finally, we use the Born approximation to find analytic formulas for the reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature and Minkowskian core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbation of the scalar field as well as the electromagnetic field over a sort of regular black holes which are characterized by the sub-Planckian curvature and the Minkowskian core. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes(QNMs) by employing the pseudo-spectral method. The outburst of overtones is manifestly observed in the QNMs of these regular black holes, which can be attributed to the deviation of the Schwarzschild black hole by quantum effects of gravity. Furthermore, the QNMs under the perturbation of electromagnetic field exhibit smaller real and imaginary parts than those under scalar field perturbation. By comparing the QNMs of the regular black hole featured by Minkowskian core with those of Bardeen black hole featured by de Sitter core, we find they may be an effective tool to distinguish these BHs.</description>

      <title>Periodic Orbits and Gravitational Wave Radiation Mechanism in the Regular Hairy Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system has extremely high research value in gravitational wave astronomy. Studying the evolution of their periodic orbits not only helps understand the nature of black holes but also reveals the long-term behavior of complex systems. In this paper, we derive the radial effective potential of a test particle and conduct an analysis of the marginally bound orbits (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO). The results indicate that, as the hair parameter $\beta$ increases, the associated parameters of MBO and ISCO decrease significantly. Based on these analyses, we explore the characteristics of periodic orbits in regular hairy black holes. The study reveals that, compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the periodic orbits in regular hairy black holes correspond to lower energy, and test particles around them can maintain stability in orbits closer to the black hole. This finding provides a new perspective for distinguishing Schwarzschild black holes from hairy black holes and opens up new research avenues for testing the no-hair theorem. Finally, we analyze the gravitational waveforms of radiation from periodic orbits using the Kludge waveform method and find that variations in the hair parameter $\beta $ introduce subtle modifications to the phase, period, and amplitude of the gravitational waves. These results not only aid in a better understanding of the dynamical properties of the regular hairy black hole but also provide insights for obtaining new clues about black hole properties through gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the thermodynamic structure of gravity at local scales. In any general curved spacetime, it is possible to transform to a local inertial frame at any point such that the metric is flat up to quadratic order where the curvature at that point comes in when the metric is written in Riemann normal coordinates. We consider local Rindler observers in that patch and hence the local Rindler horizon. In doing so, we find that the local horizons are also hot provided the $aL&gt;&gt;1$ which can always be satisfied.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. The demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The lesson for the Unruh effect is discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in short hair black hole spacetimes for extreme mass ratio systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied a short hair black hole(BH) that bypasses the "no-short-hair" theorem. It shows strong hair behavior near the event horizon and is accompanied by significant quantum effects. These effects may carry important information about the internal structure and dynamical evolution of BHs, thereby providing a new perspective on the problem of black hole information loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the influence of the hair parameter $Q_m$ and the structural parameter $k$ of the short hair BH in an extreme mass ratio(EMR) system on the periodic orbits of particles and gravitational wave radiation. The results show that as $Q_m$ increases, the radius and angular momentum of the bound orbit decrease, and the $E-L$ space shifts to the left. An increase in $k$ weakens this trend. When $k$ takes a larger value, the short hair BH and the Schwarzschild BH tend to be degenerate. Compared with the Schwarzschild BH, the bound orbit energy and angular momentum of the short hair black hole are reduced. Under the conditions of higher $Q_m$ and lower $k$, the gravitational wave period is suppressed and the signal amplitude is significantly increased. These results provide new observational means for distinguishing short hair BH from classical BH and offer new insights for verifying the no-hair theorem and understanding the physical behavior near the event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse of Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in Generalized Vaidya spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational collapse procedure in generalized Vaidya spacetime with Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter density profile. We use the generalized Vaidya metric to simulate the spacetime of a big star and subsequently obtain the field equations. Then we proceed to determine the star system's mass parameter by solving the field equations. Then the gravitational collapse mechanism is investigated using the derived solutions. Investigating the nature of the singularity (if formed) as the end state of the collapse is the main goal. Dark matter in the form of Bose-Einstein condensate is expected to play a crucial role in the fate of the collapse. We see that there is a possibility of the formation of both black holes and naked singularities as the end state of the collapse depending upon the initial conditions. The junction conditions are derived with a Vaidya exterior and a Friedmann interior and some important insights are obtained. A Penrose diagram showing the causal relations between the spacetimes is generated and studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the reheating equation of state and its impact on the inflationary tensor perturbation spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the very few available probes of the post-inflationary reheating epoch one is the spectrum of inflationary tensor perturbations which is affected by the Universe's equation of state during the reheating era. Contrary to the usual approach of assuming a constant equation of state during the reheating era, in this work, we have dynamically calculated the evolution of the reheating equation of state and find how it depends on the inflaton decay rate. We have also quantified its impact on the spectrum of the primordial tensor perturbations. Considering two different inflationary potentials of the E-model $\alpha$-attractor class with n=1(3) we have derived the evolution of the reheating equation of state for various values of the inflaton decay rate and also find that the inflationary tensor perturbations can be enhanced (suppressed) by a factor of $\sim$1.5-3 compared to the usual calculations assuming a constant equation of state. This difference is attributed to the fact that the comoving horizon evolves differently in the two approaches and hence any particular comoving momentum mode enters the horizon at different instances and subsequently evolves differently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are the fascinating objects in the universe. They represent extreme deformations in spacetime geometry. Here, we construct f(P) gravity and the first example of static-spherically symmetric black hole solution in f(P) gravity and discuss their thermodynamics. Using the numerical approach and series solution, we discover the solution and demonstrate that it is a generalization of Schwarzschild. The solution is characterized by a single function that satisfies a nonlinear fourth order differential equation. Interestingly, we can analytically calculate the solution s specific heat, Wald entropy, and Hawking temperature as a function of horizon radius. After analyzing the specific heat, we discovered that the black hole is thermodynamically stable over a small horizon radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cotton gravity was recently introduced as a higher derivative extension of General Relativity. The field equations of the theory involve the rank-3 Cotton tensor. Here we show that all solutions of the theory, including the black holes, have vanishing conserved charges, i.e. mass and angular momentum. This result implies that either the theory is unphysical since all the black holes carry the charges of the vacuum and can be created at no energy cost, or the theory has confinement of mass/energy and all other conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Effect of QCD coupling parameter ($\alpha_c$) and nonzero strange quark mass ($m_s\neq0$) on stellar structure admitting observational results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we focus on the effect of the QCD coupling parameter ($\alpha_c$) on various physical properties of compact objects admitting the MIT bag model EoS in the framework of the Tolman IV potential in the presence of nonzero strange quark mass ($m_s$). The internal matter consisting of the deconfined phase of the $3$-flavour quark, is overall charge neutral due to the presence of electrons and is assumed to strongly interact. Interestingly, the coupling parameter $\alpha_c$ has an upper limit due to thermodynamic consistency, and affects the stability in terms of energy per baryon ($E_B$). Our model is suitable for stars with masses of approximately $\leq 2.00~M_{\odot}$. The predicted radius from our model is in agreement with the estimated values of the radius from the observations. Various stability checks of our model are carried out and it is found that the model is stable within the parameter space used here.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy with nonlinear quasi-normal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future detection of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from black hole ringdown will allow for consistency and independent tests of general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we perform a ringdown Fisher forecast when including the dominant quadratic QNM (QQNM) expected in nearly equal-mass quasi-circular binary black holes (BBHs) observed by next-generation ground-based detectors, Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We consider a ringdown model with a total of four modes: three linear QNMs labeled by $(\ell m n)=(220), (330), (440)$ and one QQNM coming from the self-interaction of the dominant linear (220) QNM. We perform a forecast in two scenarios, when the QQNM parameters are considered to be: (a) independent of the linear QNMs; (b) dependent on the (220) QNM parameters, according to GR. In Scenario (a) we find the QQNM to generally be measured with better precision than the (440) mode but worse than the (330) mode. As shown in the past, high-spin BBHs tend to have higher relative QQNMs. Even in such cases, we only expect to confidently detect and resolve these four independent QNMs for nearby events, below redshift $z\sim 0.5$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. In Scenario (b) we find the QQNM to be extremely useful for improving the precision on the (440) parameters, with negligible improvements on the (220) parameters. In this case, the (440) parameters are expected to be measured even better than those of the (330) QNM. As a result, we expect to confidently detect and resolve the three independent linear QNMs for events even at high redshifts, up to $z\sim 35$ in ET and CE for intermediate-mass BHs. Therefore, thanks to the inclusion of the QQNM, virtually all second-generation BBH events will provide excellent consistency tests of GR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian restricted three-body problem involving a positive primary point mass, $m_+$, and a negative secondary point mass, $m_-$, in a circular orbit, and a positive or negative tertiary point mass, $m_3$, with $m_+ &gt; |m_-| \gg |m_3|$, is solved. Five Lagrange points are found for $m_3$, three of which are coplanar with $m_+$ and $m_-$, and two of which are not, a subtle consequence of the gravitational repulsion from $m_-$. All Lagrange points are linearly unstable, except for one point in the regime $m_+ \gtrsim 8.4 |m_-|$, which is linearly stable and collinear with $m_+$ and $m_-$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Safety within on-shell perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the renormalisation of Einstein gravity using a novel subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation. The one-loop beta function for Newton's constant receives contributions from poles in even dimensions and can be mapped to the beta function obtained using a proper-time cutoff. Field redefinitions are used to remove off-shell contributions to the renormalisation group equations. To check the consistency of our approximations we use a general parametrisation of the metric fluctuation. Within truncations of the derivative expansion and the expansion in Newton's constant, we show that the parametrisation dependence can be removed order by order. Going to all orders in the scalar curvature an all-order beta function for Newton's constant is obtained that is independent of the parameterisation. The beta function vanishes at the Reuter fixed point and the critical exponent is in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Finally, we compare the critical exponent to the counterpart computed via Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT).</description>

      <title>Noether-Wald and Komar charges in supergravity, fermions, and Killing supervectors in superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersymmetry properties of Killing vectors and spinors in supergravity theory can be clarified by relating them to Killing supervectors in the supergravity superspace. In the superspace approach it is manifest that supersymmetry 'mixes' a Killing vector with its fermionic spinor 'superpartner' and the Killing equations with the generalization of the Killing spinor equations. The latter reduces to the standard Killing spinor equation, albeit with a fermionic spinor, when the fermionic fields are set to zero. Using these supersymmetry transformations in the spacetime component approach, we construct a Noether-Wald charge of ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity with fermionic contributions which is diff-, Lorentz- and supersymmetry-invariant (up to a total derivative). The Killing supervector formalism for the maximal $D=11$ supergravity and some related issues are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A space-dependent mean for cosmological perturbations negates the ansatz of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, and hence ergodicity. In this work, we construct such a primordial mean of scalar perturbations from an alternative quantum initial state (coherent state) and examine the associated power and bi-spectra. A multitude of cosmological tests based on these spectra are discussed. We find that current cosmological data doesn't favor a primordial mean over large scales and strong constraints arise from the limit on bispectrum from Planck data. At small scales, this hypothesis can be tested by future observables such as $\mu$-distortion of CMB.</description>

      <title>Reheating constraints and the $H_0$ tension in Quintessential Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on two important aspects of modern cosmology: reheating and Hubble constant tension within the framework of a unified model, namely, quintessential inflation connecting the early inflationary era and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the context of reheating, we use instant preheating and gravitational reheating, two viable reheating mechanisms when the evolution of the universe is not affected by an oscillating regime. After obtaining the reheating temperature, we analyze the number of $e$-folds and establish its relationship with the reheating temperature. This allows us to connect, for different quintessential inflation models, the reheating temperature with the spectral index of scalar perturbations, thereby enabling us to constrain its values. In the second part of this article, we explore various alternatives to address the $H_0$ tension, a discrepancy which indicates a possible revision of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Initially, we establish that quintessential inflation alone cannot mitigate the Hubble tension by solely deviating from the concordance model at low redshifts. The introduction of a phantom fluid, capable of increasing the Hubble rate at the present time, becomes a crucial element in alleviating the Hubble tension, resulting in a deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model only at low redshifts. On a different note, by utilizing quintessential inflation as a source of early dark energy, thereby diminishing the physical size of the sound horizon close to the baryon-photon decoupling redshift, we observe a reduction in the Hubble tension. This alternative avenue, which has the same effect of a cosmological constant changing its scale close to the recombination, sheds light on the nuanced interplay between the quintessential inflation and the Hubble tension, offering a distinct perspective on addressing this cosmological challenge.</description>

      <title>Reheating Dynamics in Inflationary Cosmology: Insights from $\alpha$-Attractor and $\alpha$-Starobinsky Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reheating in inflationary cosmology is essential for understanding the early universe, influencing particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. Crucial quantities defined during the reheating epoc, such as the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$, and the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, affect inflationary observables like the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze two classes of inflationary models: generalized $\alpha$-attractor models and the $\alpha$-Starobinsky generalization. These models, motivated by supergravity and string theory, exhibit attractor behavior, ensuring strong predictions and have been studied extensively before. A salient novelty of this study, compared to previous works, is the inclusion of an analytical expression for the reheating temperature, $T_{\text{re}}$, which makes it a dynamical quantity. This is crucial for determining all the cosmological quantities analyzed in this work. Our results show a universal scaling behavior for a tightly bounded $T_{re}$ in both models. We believe this is the first time that $T_{re}$ is so closely determined. This work complements previous Bayesian and numerical studies by providing detailed numerical and analytical insights into the evolution of cosmological observables and reheating parameters, offering also constraints on inflationary models based on observational data.</description>

      <title>Uncovering thermodynamic origin of counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis. To verify this result, we utilize both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and a holographic binary superfluid model, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We find that the counterflow and coflow instabilities in binary superfluids are all essentially thermodynamic. Except the one due to order competing via global thermodynamic instability, the others are caused by an eigenvalue of the free energy Hessian diverging and changing sign. We also observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. The nonlinear stages of the instabilities are also studied by full time evolution, where vortex dynamics is found to play a significant role, resulting in the reduction of superfluid velocity back to a stable phase.</description>

      <title>Rod Structures and Patching Matrices: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review the twistor theory construction of stationary and axisymmetric, Lorentzian signature solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations and the related toric Ricci-flat metrics of Riemannian signature, \cite{W,MW,F,FW}. The construction arises from the Ward construction \cite{W2} of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills fields as holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space, with the observation of Witten \cite{LW} that the Einstein equations for these metrics include the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The principal datum for a solution is the holomorphic patching matrix $P$ for a holomorphic vector bundle on a reduced twistor space, and $P$ is typically simpler than the corresponding metric to write down.
  I give a catalogue of examples, building on earlier collections \cite{F,AG}, and consider the inverse problem: how far does the rod structure of such a metric, together with its asymptotics, determine $P$?</description>

      <title>Hints of spin-magnitude correlations and a rapidly spinning subpopulation of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex astrophysical processes leading to the formation of binary black holes and their eventual merger are imprinted on the spins of the individual black holes. We revisit the astrophysical distribution of those spins based on gravitational waves from the third gravitational wave transient catalog GWTC-3, (Abbott et al. 2023a), looking for structure in the two-dimensional space defined by the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the heavier ($\chi_1$) and lighter ($\chi_2$) component black holes. We find support for two distinct subpopulations with greater than $95\%$ credibility. The dominant population is made up of black holes with small spins, preferring $\chi_1 \approx 0.2$ for the primary and $\chi_2 \approx 0$ for the secondary; we report signs of an anticorrelation between $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, as well as as evidence against a subpopulation of binaries in which both components are nonspinning. The subdominant population consists of systems in which both black holes have relatively high spins and contains $20^{+18}_{-18}\%$ of the binaries. The binaries that are most likely to belong in this subpopulation are massive and slightly more likely to have spin-orientations aligned with the orbital angular momentum--potentially consistent with isolated binary formation channels capable of producing large spins, like chemically homogeneous evolution. This hint of a rapidly spinning subpopulation hinges on GW190517, a binary with large and well-measured spins. Our results, which are enabled by novel hierarchical inference methods, represent a first step towards more descriptive population models for black hole spins, and will be strengthened or refuted by the large number of gravitational wave detections expected in the next several years.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of Dyonic AdS Black Holes: Comparative Analysis Using Different Entropy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) for the AdS dyonic black hole carrying the central charge $C$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, neglecting the pressure and conjugate volume along with comparison of different entropy models namely the Bekenstein-Hawking and the R\'enyi entropy model. Inclusion of the magnetic charge $\tilde{Q}_m$ gives rise to a richer phase structure of the study of thermodynamics by adding a non-equilibrium transition from an unstable small black hole to a stable black hole on top of the Van der Waals transition in the $T-S$ processes and a Hawking-Page transition in the $F-T$ plots. We study an extra mixed ensemble ($\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_m)$ due to the inclusion of $\tilde{Q}_m$ where we see Van der Waals phase transition and whose plots change as the entropy model changes though the style of transition remains the same. We observe an interesting phenomenon where changing the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$, the $T-S$ process changes the same way as when varying the central charge $C$ underlining some similarity that is not seen in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy model. We observe a similarity between the plots when both charges are turned off relating to the Schwarzschild black hole and the grand-canonical ensemble. One can observe that as the entropy models are changed, the homogeneity is not lost where the mass as a function of extensive variables is of order one and the rest zero. Finally, we see a similarity in the $\mu-C$ process across the entropy models signally some universality across entropy models as well as different types of black holes studied before.</description>

      <title>The Di\'osi-Penrose model of classical gravity predicts gravitationally induced entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the dynamics of the Di\'osi-Penrose (DP) model of classical gravity can entangle the mechanical degrees of freedom of two separate particles. For standard experiments of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE), we find that entanglement can be generated iff the particles are separated by a distance smaller than some limiting value $d_c$, proportional to the only free parameter of the DP model. Greater distances can be achieved through new experimental configurations, where the initial wave-function of the particles is allowed to spread perpendicularly (as opposed to parallely) to the spatial axis separating them. Although the DP dynamics asymptotically drives the system to a separable state, we observe that, for reasonable experimental parameters, GIE can survive for more than a day. In the context of the debate on the nature of gravity, our results prove that experimental demonstrations of GIE are insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emitted radiation and absorption effects in black hole dynamics lead to inelastic scattering amplitudes. In this paper, we study how these effects introduce an inelasticity function to the $2\rightarrow2$ eikonalised $S$-matrix and how they can be described using unequal mass and spin on-shell amplitudes. To achieve this, we formulate the inelastic coupled-channel eikonal (ICCE) using the KMOC formalism and the language of quantum channels, where off-diagonal channels involve mass and spin changes. This formulation allows us to re-use usual eikonal results but also suggests a different resummation of inelastic effects. We then apply this formulation to calculate classical inelastic processes, such as the mass change in binary dynamics due to the presence of an event horizon. Additionally, we provide a complementary analysis for the case of wave scattering on a black hole, considering absorption effects. In both scenarios, we derive unitarity relations accounting for inelastic effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum black holes (BHs), thought of as an excited multilevel system, can be effectively modelled by replacing an event horizon with a partially reflective membrane. This emergent feature affects their interaction with hosting environments, with the most pronounced effects happening for particles with mass~$m_{\rm p}\lesssim (10 M_{\odot}/M)\,10^{-11}\mathrm{\,eV}$, where~$M$ is the BH mass. We show that ultra-light bosons -- a viable dark matter candidate -- can be used to probe the quantum nature of BHs. We derive analytical expressions for the accretion rate and dynamical friction acting on exotic compact objects moving through an ultra-light scalar field, finding that while the accretion rate is sensitive to the quantum BH's reflectivity, the dynamical friction is the same as for classical BHs. We then use these expressions to estimate the orbital dephasing in the inspiralling of different binaries in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) band. Our results indicate that LISA may be able to discriminate quantum from classical BHs through their different accretion rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the main properties of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by transient hyperbolic encounters of black holes. We begin by building the set of basic variables most relevant to setting our problem. After exposing the ranges of masses and eccentricities accessible at a given GW frequency, we analyze the dependence of the gravitational strain on those parameters and determine the trajectories resulting in the most sizeable strains. Some non-trivial behaviors are unveiled, showing that highly eccentric events can be more easily detectable than parabolic ones. In particular, we underline the correct way to extend formulas from hyperbolic to parabolic orbits. Our reasonings are as general as possible, and we make a point of explaining our considerations pedagogically. The majority of the work is based on Newtonian dynamics and aims at being a benchmark to which more accurate calculations can be compared.</description>

      <title>Solving the Regge-Wheeler and Teukolsky equations: supervised versus unsupervised physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To expand on the burgeoning research on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their ability to solve the eigenvalue problems in black hole (BH) perturbation theory, we implement a supervised learning approach to solve the Regge-Wheeler and Teukolsky equations, the equations of gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild and Kerr BHs, respectively. To date, applications of PINNs using the data-free (unsupervised) learning approach have proven their ability to compute quasinormal mode frequencies of BHs, quantities with physical significance in gravitational wave astronomy. To investigate the potential use of PINNs to compute quasinormal mode overtones higher than the low-lying $n=0$ and $n=1$ modes (with $n$ indexing overtones), the present work has instead applied the supervised approach to simplify computations. Consistent with the universal approximation theory of neural networks, it is found that the PINN algorithm has the intrinsic ability to recover the complex frequencies for various spin sequences (i.e. $s=-2$, $a \in \{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4\}$, $\ell = 2$, $m \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, $n \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$), with approximation errors increasing with the rotation parameter $a$ and overtone number $n$ as a result of the residuals from the training data.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Cosmology Based on Gauss-Bonnet Theory with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on renormalizable cosmology based on the Gauss-Bonnet theory with torsion. Within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory, we study the matter field containing the Gauss-Bonnet correction term. By modifying the gauge model, which includes a charged scalar field and two families of fermions, and introducing torsion and Gauss-Bonnet corrections, we analyze the field equations in the super-symmetric hybrid inflation model, investigate the properties of torsion in a flat universe, the characteristics of the energy-momentum tensor, and the sensitivity of the theoretical model to correction parameters. This study shows that the Gauss-Bonnet correction term can directly affect the Hubble constant through the Einstein equations, providing a new observational perspective. This paper proposes a cosmological model that can be adjusted according to different Gauss-Bonnet correction models, providing a theoretical reference for future observational verification of various Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <title>The Lensing Effect of Quantum-Corrected Black Hole and Parameter Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-corrected black hole model demonstrates significant potential in the study of gravitational lensing effects. By incorporating quantum effects, this model addresses the singularity problem in classical black holes. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the quantum correction parameter on the lensing effect based on the quantum corrected black hole model. Using the black holes $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ as our subjects, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter on angular position, Einstein ring, and time delay. Additionally, we use data from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter. Our results indicate that the quantum correction parameter significantly affects the lensing coefficients $\bar{a}$ and $\bar{b}$, as well as the Einstein ring. The position $\theta_{\infty}$ and brightness ratio $S$ of the relativistic image exhibit significant changes,with deviations on the order of magnitude of $\sim 1\mu as$ and $\sim 0.01\mu as$, respectively. The impact of the quantum correction parameter on the time delay $\Delta T_{21}$ is particularly significant in the $M87^*$ black hole, with deviations reaching up to several tens of hours. Using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT) of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter, the constraint range under the $M87^*$ black hole is $0\le \frac{\alpha}{M^2}\le 1.4087$ and the constraint range under the $Sgr A^*$ black hole is $0.9713\le \frac{\alpha}{M^2}\le 1.6715$ . Although the current resolution of the EHT limits the observation of subtle differences, future high-resolution telescopes are expected to further distinguish between the quantum-corrected black hole and the Schwarzschild black hole, providing new avenues for exploring quantum gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>The generalized second law in Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Bekenstein generalized entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole, with the contribution of an external matter field affected by degrees of freedom near the event horizon. In the Euclidean section of the Schwarzschild manifold, we consider an Euclidean quantum effective model, a scalar theory in the presence of an additive disorder field. The average of the Gibbs free energy over the ensemble of possible configurations of the disorder is obtained by the distributional zeta-function method. In the series representation for the average free energy, the effective actions give rise to generalized Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Riemannian manifolds. Finally, is presented the generalized entropy density with the contributions of the black hole geometric entropy and the external matter fields. The validity of the generalized second law using Euclidean functional methods is obtained.</description>

      <title>Mapping eccentricity evolutions between numerical relativity and effective-one-body gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in compact binaries is considered to be a key tracer of their astrophysical origin, and can be inferred from gravitational-wave observations due to its imprint on the emitted signal. For a robust measurement, accurate waveform models are needed. However, ambiguities in the definition of eccentricity can obfuscate the physical meaning and result in seemingly discrepant measurements. In this work we present a suite of 28 new numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes with mass ratios between 1 and 6 and initial post-Newtonian eccentricities between 0.05 and 0.3. We then develop a robust pipeline for measuring the eccentricity evolution as a function of frequency from gravitational-wave observables that is applicable even to signals that span at least $\gtrsim 7$ orbits. We assess the reliability of our procedure and quantify its robustness under different assumptions on the data. Using the eccentricity measured at the first apastron, we initialise effective-one-body waveforms and quantify how the precision in the eccentricity measurement, and therefore the choice of the initial conditions, impacts the agreement with the numerical data. We find that even small deviations in the initial eccentricity can lead to non-negligible differences in the phase and amplitude of the waveforms. However, we demonstrate that we can reliably map the eccentricities between the simulation data and analytic models, which is crucial for robustly building eccentric hybrid waveforms, and to improve the accuracy of eccentric waveform models in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>The Study of the Canonical forms of Killing tensor in vacuum with {\Lambda}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. The general scope of the study is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein's equations that exhibit hidden symmetries or to identify the hidden symmetries in already known spacetimes that may emerge during the resolution process. In this preliminary paper, we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor, based on a geometrical approach to classify the canonical forms of symmetric 2-rank tensors, as postulated by R. V. Churchill. Subsequently, the derived integrability conditions of the canonical forms serve as additional equations transforming the under-determined system of equations, comprising of Einstein's Field Equations and the Bianchi Identities (in vacuum with {\Lambda}), into an over-determined one. Using a null rotation around the null tetrad frame we manage to simplify the system of equations to the point where the geometric characterization (Petrov Classification) of the extracted solutions can be performed and their null congruences can be characterized geometrically. Therein, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O) where some of them appeared to be new. The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superpotential method is a reconstruction technique which has proven useful to build exact cosmological solutions. We here employ the superpotential method in order to reconstruct the features necessary for the inflaton potential to drive inflation and lead to the amplification of the curvature perturbations. Such an amplification, at wavelengths shorter than those observed in the cosmic microwave background, is necessary in order to have a significant formation of primordial black holes after inflation ends. The technique is applied to the cases of a minimally coupled inflaton, to the nonminimal coupling case and to $f(R)$ theories of gravity. For such theories, a model dependent analysis of the features leading to the scalar spectrum enhancement is also presented.</description>

      <title>The ringdown-Hawking radiation connection in real and analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the usual picture of Hawking radiation, the emission is spontaneous; it is caused by nothing. In contrast, the radiation from the ringdown after a black-hole merger is caused dynamically by the fluctuations of the event horizon. We explore the possibility that Hawking radiation is also emitted dynamically by horizon fluctuations, in the form of quasinormal modes. In fact, we find that the fundamental, least-damped quasinormal mode is sufficient to radiate the entire Hawking spectrum of photons and gravitons, since the quasinormal mode spectrum is broadened by damping. The resulting Hawking spectra are accurate with no graybody factors. By comparing Hawking radiation to ringdowns, we find that the quantum fluctuations of the horizon should be on the order of 0.1 Planck lengths. We compare this result with predictions ranging over 60 orders of magnitude. Further support for the model is provided by a sonic black hole experiment, in which additional horizon fluctuations are seen to produce Hawking-like radiation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model does not contradict to the recent observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study simulates the characteristics of spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar bodies with electrical charge within the framework of the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. Employing the Krori-Barua metric ansatz (K.D. Krori, J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508) along with a linear form of $f(Q)$ model, {\it viz.}, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we obtain a tractable set of exact relativistic solutions of the field equations. A specific form of charge $(q=q_{0}r^{3})$ is considered here for the present analysis. It is noted that the model is valid up to the value of charge intensity $q_{0}\leq0.0009~Km^{-2}$. Beyond this value, the model does not permit physically viable results. We have obtained the best fit equation of state in the model, which is incorporated to solve the TOV equations numerically to determine the mass-radius relation within the parameter space used here. With increasing charge intensity $(q_{0})$ from 0.0002 to 0.0009, the maximum mass ranges from $2.84-2.92~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radii range from $12.00-12.20~Km$. Moreover, the predicted radii of some recently observed pulsars and GW 190814 show that our model also complies with the estimated radii based on the observational results. Our model is found to satisfy all the characteristic features, such as behaviour of matter variables, causality condition, energy constraints and stability criteria, which are pertinent in the context of a stable stellar configuration to emerge as a viable and physically acceptable stellar model in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of emergent electric field. This is distinguished from the fundamental one in that the emergent electric field directly appears in observations through the Lorentz force, while the latter enters the phase space as the canonical momentum of the electromagnetic field. In Hamiltonian classical electromagnetism this concept naturally appears after introducing the topological $\theta$ term. Furthermore, we show that in the spherically symmetric model the concept of emergent electric field allows us to formulate a modified theory of electromagnetism that is otherwise impossible. The relation between the fundamental and the emergent electric fields is derived from the imposition of general covariance of the electromagnetic strength tensor, which is a nontrivial task in the canonical formulation the modified theory is based on. We couple this theory to emergent modified gravity, where a similar distinction between spacetime and gravity is made such that the spacetime, which defines the observable geometry, is an emergent field composed of the fundamental gravitational field. In this more encompassing emergent field theory coupling gravity and electromagnetism, we show that the spherically symmetric model contains a nonsingular black hole solution where not only modified gravity but also modified electromagnetism is crucial for a robust singularity resolution and to avoid the existence of (super)extermal black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

Abstract: We investigate compact stars in the noninteger power (NIP) model of $f(R)$ gravity theory, which includes the higher-curvature correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The mass-radius relation of the compact stars in the NIP model predicts large deviations from those in the general relativity in the low-mass region, potentially allowing us to test the NIP model by future astrophysical observations. We also study the nonvanishing scalar hair surrounding the compact star and demonstrate that the chameleon mechanism works efficiently. They result in distinct scalar profiles inside and outside the star, which implies screening the fifth force mediated by the scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is regarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and constraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted accretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship between the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the case of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum inner shadow size of $S_{\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the black hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\circ}$ and the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the inner shadow exhibits novel configurations--taking on petal, crescent, or eyebrow shapes--significantly smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ across various parameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to the accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a diagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion disk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain parameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which could also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Charged superradiant instability in a spherical regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that time is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations which offer a way to achieve unitarity. We rewrite the QFT in Minkowski spacetime with a direct-sum Fock space structure based on the discrete spacetime transformations and geometric superselection rules. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then comment on understanding the scattering of states in de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach to future research in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of a simple renormalizable shift symmetric model with a higher derivative kinetic energy and quartic derivative coupling, that can serve as a toy model for higher derivative theories of gravity. The scattering amplitude behaves as in a normal effective field theory below the threshold for the production of ghosts, but has an unexpectedly soft behavior above the threshold. The physical running of the parameters is extracted from the 2-point and 4-point amplitudes. The results are compared to those obtained by other methods and are found to agree only in limiting cases. We draw several lessons that may apply also to gravity.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Observed Trends in FRB Population and Bi-modality in their Peak Luminosity Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective Lifshitz black holes with arbitrary dynamical exponent are addressed in the fluid/gravity membrane paradigm. The transport and the response coefficients in the dual Lifshitz field theory are calculated and analyzed, including the charge diffusion constant and the shear mode damping constant, along with the shear-viscosity-to-entropy density ratio. The Kubo formula is employed to obtain the electrical DC conductivity for the gauge sector corresponding to impurity through the holographic linear response of gauge vector fluctuations in the Lifshitz black brane geometry.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time transformation between the geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric coordinate reference systems requires relativistic corrections to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. To maintain consistency with Terrestrial Time (TT), solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) on average must exhibit no rate difference from TT. Although the IAU has established resolutions for transformations involving TT and TDB, the analogous transformation between TDB and a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential, especially with upcoming robotic and crewed lunar missions. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, at the rate of 56.0256 us/d, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Coport: A New Public Code for Polarized Radiative Transfer in a Covariant Framework$^\spadesuit$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativistic radiative transfer calculations are essential for comparing theoretical models of black hole accretion flows and jets with observational data. In this work, we introduce Coport, a novel public code specifically designed for covariant polarized ray-tracing radiative transfer computations in any spacetime. Written in Julia, Coport includes an interface for visualizing numerical results obtained from HARM, a publicly available implementation of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate the precision of our code by comparing its outputs with the results from a variety of established methodologies. This includes the verification against analytical solutions, the validation through thin-disk assessments, and the evaluation via thick-disk analyses. Notably, our code employs a methodology that eliminates the need for separating the computations of spacetime propagation and plasma propagation. Instead, it directly solves the coupled, covariant, polarized radiative transfer equation in curved spacetime, seamlessly integrating the effects of gravity with plasma influences. This approach sets our code apart from the existing alternatives and enhances its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Commutator technique for the heat kernel of minimal higher derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new technique of the asymptotic heat kernel expansion for minimal higher derivative operators of a generic $2M$-th order, $F(\nabla)=(-\Box)^M+\cdots$, in the background field formalism of gauge theories and quantum gravity. This technique represents the conversion of the recently suggested Fourier integral method of generalized exponential functions [Phys. Rev. D105, 065013 (2022), arXiv:2112.03062] into the commutator algebra of special differential operators, which allows one to express expansion coefficients for $F(\nabla)$ in terms of the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of a minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$. This procedure is based on special functorial properties of the formalism including the Mellin-Barnes representation of the complex operator power $H^M(\nabla)$ and naturally leads to the origin of generalized exponential functions without directly appealing to the Fourier integral method. The algorithm is essentially more straightforward than the Fourier method and consists of three steps ready for computer codification by symbolic manipulation programs. They begin with the decomposition of the operator into a power of some minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$ and its lower derivative "perturbation part" $W(\nabla)$, $F(\nabla)=H^M(\nabla)+W(\nabla)$, followed by considering their multiple nested commutators. The second step is the construction of special local differential operators -- the perturbation theory in powers of the lower derivative part $W(\nabla)$. The final step is the so-called procedure of their {\em syngification} consisting in a special modification of the covariant derivative monomials in these operators by Synge world function $\sigma(x,x')$ with their subsequent action on the HaMiDeW coefficients of $H(\nabla)$.</description>

      <title>Novel standard candle: Collapsing axion stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, various cosmic observations have produced differing posterior values for $H_0$, resulting in what is referred to as the $H_0$ tension. To resolve this discrepancy, utilizing other cosmological probes to constrain $H_0$ is advantageous. In the quest to identify dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles, collectively referred to as axions, have become leading contenders. These elusive particles can coalesce into dense structures known as axion stars via Bose-Einstein condensation. When these axion stars exceed a critical mass, typically through accretion or merging, they experience a self-induced collapse. This process results in short radio bursts, assuming a decay constant $f_a\lesssim10^{13}{\rm{GeV}}$, with the frequency depending on the axion mass and the luminosity determined by both the axion mass and decay constant. Therefore, we propose that collapsing axion stars could serve as a novel standard candle to constrain $H_0$. Even more interesting is that the radio bursts emitted by collapsing axion stars with specific parameters match the characteristics of observed non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Thus, FRBs generated by collapsing axion stars have the potential to be used as standard candles to constrain $H_0$.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics, namely the limit of vanishing speed of light, for the most general, four-dimensional, duality and conformal invariant electromagnetism. The theory is parameterized by a unique real constant $\gamma$, which remains playing a non-trivial role in the magnetic Carrollian case, while it can be removed in the electric Carrollian contraction, and we therefore focus in the former. Applying the technique of Lie point symmetries, we obtain that the magnetic limit is invariant under the Carrollian group, as well as under the local translation in Carrollian time $x^{0}\rightarrow x^{0\prime}=x^{0}+f\left(x^{i}\right) $ and $x^{i}\rightarrow x^{i\prime}=x^{i}$, with $f$ being an arbitrary function. A diagonal part of the symmetries span the Conformal Carroll algebra of level $2$, $\mathfrak{ccarr}_2$ in four dimensions. Two additional internal symmetries remain in the Carrollian limit of ModMax standing for the conformal invariance of the theory, as well as the invariance under duality transformations.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. NSs formed with stronger chaotic magnetic fields exhibit a lower maximum mass compared to those formed with weaker chaotic magnetic fields. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field can increase the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>
