      <title>Higher level $q$-multiple zeta values with applications to quasimodular forms and partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the generalized sum-of-divisor functions of MacMahon have been unified into the algebraic framework of $q$-multiple zeta values. In particular, these results link partition theory, quasimodular forms, $q$-multiple zeta values, and quasi-shuffle algebras. In this paper, we complete this idea of unification for higher levels, demonstrating that any quasimodular form of weight $k \geq 2$ and level $N$ may be expressed in terms of the $q$-multiple zeta values of level $N$ studied algebraically by Yuan and Zhao. We also give results restricted to $q$-multiple zeta values with integer coefficients, and we construct completely additive generating sets for spaces of quasimodular forms and for quasimodular forms with integer coefficients. We also provide a variety of computational examples from number-theoretic perspectives that suggest many new applications of the algebraic structure of $q$-multiple zeta values to quasimodular forms and partitions.</description>

      <title>Binary forms with covariant points close to the real axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real binary form $F(X, Z)$, Stoll and Cremona have defined a reduction theory using the action of the modular group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, and associated to each binary form a covariant point $z(F)$ located in the upper half plane. When the point $z(F)$ is close to the real axis, then at least half of the roots will be on a circle of small radius $r$. Conversely, we find conditions depending on the radius $r$ such that the covariant point $z(F)$ to be close to the real axis. The results have further applications to improving the reduction algorithm for binary forms of Stoll and Cremona.</description>

      <title>$(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over relatively discrete algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will consider $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'{\i}guez Camargo.</description>

      <title>MacMahonesque partition functions detect sets related to primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono constructs explicit expressions in the partition functions of MacMahon that detect the prime numbers. Furthermore, they define generalizations, the MacMahonesque functions, and prove there are infinitely many such expressions in these functions. Here, we show how to modify and adapt their construction to detect cubes of primes as well as primes in arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>The Differential and Boomerang Properties of a Class of Binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an odd positive integer and $p$ be an odd prime with $p\equiv 3\ ({\rm{mod}}\ 4)$. In this paper, we study the differential properties of the function $F_{2,u}(x)=x^2\big(1+u\eta(x)\big)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^*$ and $\eta$ is the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We determine the differential uniformity of $F_{2,u}$ for any $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^*$ and determine the differential spectrum and boomerang uniformity of the locally-APN function $F_{2,\pm 1}$.</description>

      <title>Moyennes de certaines fonctions multiplicatives sur les entiers friables, 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider logarithmic averages, over friable integers, of non-negative multiplicative functions. Under logarithmic, one-sided or two-sided hypotheses, we obtain sharp estimates that improve upon known results in the literature regarding both the quality of the error term and the range of validity. The one-sided hypotheses correspond to classical sieve assumptions. They are applied to provide an effective form of the Johnsen--Selberg prime power sieve.</description>

      <title>Short Solutions To Homogenous Linear congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Str\"ombergsson and Venkatesh proved that a system of homogeneous linear congruence modulo prime has a positive probability to have a short non-trivial solution. We extend this result and show that the same holds for square-free moduli. In the case of 2-variables single linear congruence, we show that there is a positive probability to have a short solution for all integer moduli as well as positive probability for having short non-trivial solutions which are primitive in a suitable sense.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Moments and Hecke Trace Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ono, Saad, and Saikia introduced moments for hypergeometric functions over finite fields. These authors and Pujahari have established moments for several $_{2}F_{1}$ and $_{3}F_{2}$ cases. We study $_{2}F_{1}$ and $_{3}F_{2}$ cases when the hypergeometric data is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and primitive. Moments are established in several cases using Hecke trace formulas of hypergeometric origin recently shown by Hoffman, Li, Long, and Tu. We also obtain several algebraic formulas in the finite-field setting and present conjectures for additional $_{2}F_{1}$ and $_{3}F_{2}$ moments.</description>

Abstract: For $G=\mathrm{SL}_2$ or $\mathrm{GL}_2$, we present explicit formulas for the nonabelian Fourier kernels on $G$, as conjectured by A. Braverman and D. Kazhdan. Additionally, we furnish explicit formulas for the orbital Hankel transform on $G$, a topic investigated by the second author, and provide an explicit formula for the stable orbital integral of the basic function. These results are applicable to local fields with residual characteristics other than two.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Mahler measures and special values of $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Mahler measures of two well-studied families of bivariate polynomials, namely $P_t=x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1}+\sqrt{t}$ and $Q_t=x^3+y^3+1-\sqrt[3]{t}xy$, where $t$ is a complex parameter. In the cases when the zero loci of these polynomials define CM elliptic curves over number fields, we derive general formulas for their Mahler measures in terms of $L$-values of cusp forms. For each family, we also classify all possible values of $t$ in number fields of degree not exceeding $4$ for which the corresponding elliptic curves have complex multiplication. Finally, for all such values of $t$ in totally real number fields of degree $n=2$ and $n=4$, corresponding to elliptic curves $\mathcal{F}_t$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}_t$), we prove that determinants of $n\times n$ matrices whose entries are Mahler measures corresponding to their Galois conjugates are non-zero rational multiples of $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{F}_t,0)$ (resp. $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{C}_t,0)$).</description>

      <title>Quantitative rank distribution conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the exact counting of all elliptic curves over $K = \mathbb{F}_q(t)$ with $\mathrm{char}(K) &gt; 3$ by Bejleri, Satriano and the author, together with the torsion-free nature of most elliptic curves over global function fields proven by Phillips, and the overarching conjecture of Goldfeld and Katz-Sarnak regarding the ``Distribution of Ranks of Elliptic Curves''. Consequently, we arrive at the quantitative statement which naturally renders even finer conjecture regarding the lower order main terms differing for the number of $E/K$ with $|E(K)| = 1$ and $E(K) = \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all modular invariant representations of the Kac--Moody algebras. Ahn, Chung, and Tye studied the string functions of the admissible highest weight representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and realized them as the characters of the generalized parafermionic theories. These string functions are allowed to have certain positive and negative rational levels, for integer levels they reduce to the well-studied string functions of the integrable highest weight representations of Kac and Peterson. In this paper we demonstrate that the mock modular part of $1/2$-level string functions can be evaluated in terms of Ramanujan's mock theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of positive discriminant (Mortenson and Zwegers, 2023). We also present elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities and mixed mock modular properties for certain examples of $1/2$-level string functions. In addition, we show that the negative level string functions can be evaluated in terms of false theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of negative discriminant (Mortenson, 2024).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we relate $L(1,\pi,\mathrm{Ad}^\circ)$ to the congruence ideals for cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over any number field. We then use this result to deduce relationships between the congruences of automorphic forms and adjoint $L$-functions. For CM fields, we apply the result to obtain a lower bound on the cardinality of certain Selmer groups in terms of $L(1,\pi,\mathrm{Ad}^\circ)$.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic approach to the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ be an elliptic curve and $p$ an odd prime such that $E$ has good ordinary reduction at $p$ and the Galois representation on $E[p]$ is irreducible. Then Greenberg's $\mu=0$ conjecture predicts that the Selmer group of $E$ over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ is cofinitely generated as a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module. In this article we study this conjecture from a statistical perspective. We extend the heuristics of Poonen and Rains to obtain further evidence for Greenberg's conjecture. The key idea is that the vanishing of the $\mu$-invariant can be detected by the intersection $M_1\cap M_2$ of two Iwasawa modules $M_1, M_2$ with additional properties in a given inner product space. The heuristic is based on showing that there is a probability measure on the space of pairs $(M_1, M_2)$ respect to which the event that $M_1\cap M_2$ is finite happens with probability $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\omega(n)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of $n$. Assuming a suitably uniform version of the prime $k$-tuples conjecture, we show that the number \begin{align*} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\omega(n)}{2^n} \end{align*} is irrational. This settles (conditionally) a question of Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>On the Real Zeroes of Half-integral Weight Hecke Cusp Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the distribution of zeroes of half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms on the manifold $\Gamma_0(4)\backslash\mathbb H$ near a cusp at infinity. In analogue of the Ghosh-Sarnak conjecture for classical holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, one expects that almost all of the zeroes sufficiently close to this cusp lie on two vertical geodesics $\Re(s)=-1/2$ and $\Re(s)=0$ as the weight tends to infinity. We show that for $\gg K^2/(\log K)^{3/2}$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspace with weight bounded by a large constant $K$, the number of such "real" zeroes grows almost at the expected rate. We also obtain a weaker lower bound for the number of real zeroes that holds for a positive proportion of forms. One of the key ingredients is the asymptotic evaluation of averaged first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>An average case efficient algorithm for solving two variable linear diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving two variable linear diophantine equations has applications in many cryptographic protocols such as RSA and Elliptic curve cryptography. Extended euclid's algorithm is the most widely used algorithm to solve these equations. We revisit two algorithms to solve two variable linear diophantine equations. For one of them, we do fine-grained analysis of the number of recursive calls and find a periodic function, which represents the number of recursive calls. We find the period and use it to derive an accurate closed form expression for the average number of recursive calls incurred by that algorithm. In the process of this derivation we get an upper bound on the average number of recursive calls, which depends on the intermediate values observed during the execution of algorithm. We propose an iterative version of the algorithm. While implementation of our algorithm, we verify a well known result from number theory about the probability of two random integers being coprime. Due to that result, our algorithm encounters an additional constraint for approximately 40% times. On almost all of these constrained inputs i.e. on nearly 100 % of them the algorithm outperforms two existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants of integrable polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integrable polygon is one whose interior angles are fractions of $\pi$; that is to say of the form $\frac \pi n$ for positive integers $n$. We consider the Laplace spectrum on these polygons with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and we obtain new spectral invariants for these polygons. This includes new expressions for the spectral zeta function and zeta-regularized determinant as well as a new spectral invariant contained in the short-time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace. Moreover, we demonstrate relationships between the short-time heat trace invariants of general polygonal domains (not necessarily integrable) and smoothly bounded domains and pose conjectures and further related directions of investigation.</description>

      <title>A sumset version of a conjecture of Pilz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pilz's conjecture states that for any finite set $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k\}$ of positive integers and positive integer $n$ in the union of the sets $\{a_1,2a_1,\dots,na_1\},\dots, \{a_k,2a_k,\dots,na_k\}$ (considered as a multiset) at least $n$ values appear an odd number of times. In this short note we consider a variant of this problem. Namely, we show that in the sumset $\{a_1,2a_1,\dots,na_1\}+\dots+\{a_k,2a_k,\dots,na_k\}$ (considered as a multiset) at least $n$ values appear an odd number of times.</description>

Abstract: In a groundbreaking paper, T. Fukaya and K. Kato proved a slight weakening of a conjecture of the author's relating modular symbols and cup products of cyclotomic units under an assumption that a Kubota-Leopoldt p-adic L-function has no multiple zeros. This article describes a refinement of their method that sheds light on the role of the p-adic L-function.</description>

      <title>Rational function approximations of the special function $e^{x}E_{1}(x)$ and applications to irrationality of Euler-Gompertz constant $\delta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{d4}, we gave a method to construct a continued fraction of the function $F(x):=e^{x}E_{1}(x)$. More precisely we define $F_{1}(x)$ as the reciprocal of $F(x)$ and we inductively define $F_{m}(x)$ as the reciprocal of ``$F_{m-1}(x)$ minus the main term of $F_{m-1}(x)$ at infinity''. We calculated the main term of $F_{m}(x)$ at infinity by using \cite[Proposition 2.1]{d4}. This method is analogous to the regular continued fraction expansion of real numbers. \\ \ \ \ \ In this paper we prove that the continued fraction converges to $F(x)$ for any positive real number $x&gt;0$ by following the proof of that the regular continued fraction of a positive and irrational real number $\alpha$ converges to $\alpha$. Essentially we prove inequalities for $Q_{m}(x)$ (in Theorem 4.1) and inequalities $F_{m}(x)&gt;0$ (in Section 5). In particular, we prove stronger inequalities $\displaystyle\frac{P_{2k}(x)}{Q_{2k}(x)}&lt;F(x)&lt;\displaystyle\frac{P_{2k-1}(x)}{Q_{2k-1}(x)}$ (than $F_{m}(x)&gt;0$) and give two proofs of these. In Section 6, we show an asymptotic relation between $Q_{2k}(x)$ and $Q_{2k-1}(x)$ by using properties of the classical Laguerre polynomial. In Section 7, we consider Euler-Gompertz constant $\delta$. As far as we know, irrationality of $\delta$ is still an open problem. We construct a sequence of rationals $\displaystyle\frac{A_{i}}{B_{i}}\ (i=1,2,3,\cdots)$ such that $\delta B_{i}-A_{i}$ approaches 0 as $i$ approaches infinity and give a sufficient condition of that $\delta B_{i}-A_{i}\neq 0$ for any positive integer $i$. Therefore, if it is proved that this condition holds, it completes a proof of irrationality of Euler-Gompertz constant $\delta$.</description>

      <title>The genus of division algebras over discrete valued fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a field with a set of discrete valuations $V$, we show how the genus of a division algebra over the field is related to the genus of the residue algebras at various valuations in $V$ and the ramification data. When the division algebra is a quaternion, we show the triviality of genus over many fields which include higher local fields, function fields of curves over higher local fields and function fields of curves over real closed fields. We also consider function fields of curves over global fields with a rational point and show how the genus problem is related to the $2$-torsion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of its Jacobian. As a special case, we show how the methods developed yield better bounds on the size of the genus over function fields of elliptic curves and demonstrate how they can be computed directly using arithmetic data of the elliptic curve with a number of examples.</description>

      <title>On fine Mordell-Weil groups over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Greenberg has posed a question whether the structure of the fine Selmer group over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ can be described by cyclotomic polynomials in a certain precise manner. A recent work of Lei has made progress on this problem by proving that the fine Mordell-Weil group (in the sense of Wuthrich) does have this required property. The goal of this paper is study the analogous question of Greenberg over various $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic field $F$. In particular, when the elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field, we obtain analogous results of Lei over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension and anti-cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$. In the event that the elliptic curve has good ordinary reduction at the prime $p$, we further obtain a result over the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$ unramified outside precisely one of the prime of $F$ above $p$. Finally, we study the situation of an elliptic curve over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension under the generalized Heegner hypothesis. Along the way, we establish an analogous result for the BDP-Selmer group. This latter result is then applied to obtain a relation between the BDP $p$-adic $L$-function and the Mordell-Weil rank growth in the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quadratic curves over $F_p$, the number of solutions, which is governed by an analogue of the Mordell-Weil group, is expressed with the Legendre symbol of a coefficient of quadratic curves. Focusing on the number of solutions, a quadratic curve analogue of the modular form in the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is proposed. This modular form yields the Gaussian sum and also possesses some modular transformation structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. We improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Bourqui's work on anticanonical height zeta functions on Hirzebruch surfaces, we study height zeta functions of split toric varieties with Picard rank 2 over global function fields, with respect to height functions associated with big metrized line bundles. We show that these varieties can be naturally decomposed into a finite disjoint union of subvarieties, where precise analytic properties of the corresponding height zeta functions can be given. As application, we obtain asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points of large height on each subvariety, with explicit leading constants and controlled error terms.</description>

      <title>Artin Symmetric Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an algebraic invariant attached to Galois representations over number fields. This invariant, which we call an Artin symmetric function, lives in a certain ring we introduce called the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions. This ring is built from a family of symmetric functions rings indexed by prime ideals of the base field. We prove many necessary basic results for the ring of arithmetic symmetric functions as well as introduce the analogues of some standard number-theoretic objects in this setting. We prove that the Artin symmetric functions satisfy the same algebraic properties that the Artin L-functions do with respect to induction, inflation, and direct summation of representations. The expansion coefficients of these symmetric functions in different natural bases are shown to be character values of representations of a compact group related to the original Galois group. In the most interesting case, the expansion coefficients into a specialized Hall-Littlewood basis come from new representations built from the original Galois representation using polynomial functors corresponding to modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Using a special case of the Satake isomorphism in type GL, as formulated by Macdonald, we show that the Artin symmetric functions yield families of functions in the (finite) global spherical Hecke algebras in type GL which exhibit natural stability properties. We compute the Mellin transforms of these functions and relate them to infinite products of shifted Artin L-functions. We then prove some analytic properties of these Dirichlet series and give an explicit expansion of these series using the Hall-Littlewood polynomial functors.</description>

Abstract: We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the set defined by a M\"obius transformation of positive integers is a set of multiplicative recurrence. A Khinchin-type lower bound is also established. This not only answers a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun but also strengthens their result. The key input in our proof is Tao's logarithmically averaged correlations of non-pretentious multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Koblitz formula and almost circulant matrices related to Jacobi sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider the arithmetic properties of the cyclotomic matrix $B_p(k)=\left[J_p(\chi^{ki},\chi^{kj})^{-1}\right]_{1\le i,j\le (p-1-k)/k}$, where $p$ is an odd prime, $1\le k&lt;p-1$ is a divisor of $p-1$, $\chi$ is a generator of the group of all multiplicative character of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $J_p(\chi^{ki},\chi^{kj})$ is Jacobi sum over $\mathbb{F}_p$.
  By using the Gross-Koblitz Formula and some $p$-adic tools, we first prove that
  $$p^{n-2}\det B_p(k)\equiv (-1)^{\frac{(n-1)(p+n-3)}{2}} \left(\frac{1}{k!}\right)^{n-2}\frac{1}{(2k)!}\pmod {p},$$
  where $p-1=kn$. We next establish some theories on almost circulant matrices and then show that
  $$\det B_p(k)=(-1)^{\frac{(n-1)(p+n-1)}{2}}p^{-(n-1)}n^{n-2}a_p(k),$$
  where $U_k$ is the set of all $k$-th roots of unity over $\mathbb{F}_p$, and $a_p(k)$ is the coefficient of $t$ of the minimal polynomial of the algebraic integer $\sum_{y\in U_k}(e^{2\pi{\bf i}y/p}-1)$. Also, for $k=1,2$ we obtain explicit expressions of $\det B_p(k)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraization of Mochizuki's anabelian variation of ring structures, perfectoid geometry and formal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.06840v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a multiplicative monoid with identity. Then I show that there is a universal one dimensional formal group law equipped with an action of $M$. If $M$ is $p$-perfect (i.e. $m\mapsto m^p$ is an isomorphism for some prime number $p$) then the universal $M$-formal group law comes equipped with a natural Frobenius endomorphism. There are a number of concrete applications of this result. If $K$ is a $p$-adic field and $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_K$ is the multiplicative monoid of the ring of integers of $K$, then there is a universal formal group (over a suitable (non-zero) ring) which is equipped with an action of the multiplicative monoid $\mathcal{O}$. Lubin-Tate formal groups arise from this universal monoid formal group law. This has applications to Mochizuki's anabelian ideas: if two p-adic fields have isomorphic absolute Galois groups then they have isomorphic multiplicative monoids $\mathcal{O}$ (but possibly non-isomorphic ring structures). The existence of the universal monoid formal group law for the monoid $\mathcal{O}$ implies that the additive structures of a ring can be interpolated into a universal algebraic family (while keeping the multiplicative structure of the ring fixed). Here is another important example covered by my result: let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $R^\flat$ be its tilt and the multiplicative monoid $R^\flat$ of $R^\flat$. Then there exists a universal monoid formal group law for this monoid which interpolates the additive structures of untilts with tilt $R^\flat$. Thus in some sense one has a unified approach to various phenomenon which are well-known in anabelian geometry and in perfectoid geometry. These results also provide a natural number field version of Fontaine's fundamental ring $A_{inf}$ of $p$-adic Hodge Theory (Remark~4.2.4).</description>

      <title>Casselman--Shahidi conjecture on the singularity of intertwining operators: groups of exceptional type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a sequel to our recent work on Casselman--Shahidi's holomorphicity conjecture on half-normalized intertwining operators for quasi-split classical groups, we modify our method, based on a lemma of Heiermann--Opdam, to prove certain cases of the conjecture for groups of exceptional type uniformly. One main ingredient, established here, is to find an algorithm to produce reduced decompositions of co-rank one relative longest Weyl elements, in terms of certain "small" counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quadratic residue patterns, algebraic curves and a K3 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic residue patterns modulo a prime are studied since 19th century. In the first part we extend existing results on the number of consecutive $\ell$-tuples of quadratic residues, studying corresponding algebraic curves and their jacobians, which happen to be products of jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In the second part we state the last unpublished result of Lydia Goncharova on squares such that their differences are also squares, reformulate it in terms of algebraic geometry of a K3 surface, and prove it. The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Local Langlands in families: The banal case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We state a conjecture, local Langlands in families, connecting the centre of the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$-modules of a quasi-split $p$-adic group $\mathrm{G}$ (where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field of the underlying local field), the ring of global functions on the stack of Langlands parameters for $\mathrm{G}$ over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$, and the endomorphisms of a Gelfand-Graev representation for $\mathrm{G}$. For a class of classical $p$-adic groups (symplectic, unitary, or split odd special orthogonal groups), we prove this conjecture after inverting an integer depending only on $\mathrm{G}$. Along the way, we show that the local Langlands correspondence for classical $p$-adic groups (1) preserves integrality of $\ell$-adic representations; (2) satisfies an "extended" (generic) packet conjecture; (3) is compatible with parabolic induction up to semisimplification (generalizing a result of Moussaoui), hence induces a semisimple local Langlands correspondence; and (4) the semisimple correspondence is compatible with automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}$ fixing $\sqrt{q}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Algebraticity of the Fast and Slow Triangle Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to show that both the fast and slow versions of the triangle map (a type of multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm) in dimension $n$ are ergodic, resolving a conjecture of Messaoudi, Noguiera and Schweiger. This particular type of higher dimensional multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm has recently been linked to the study of partition numbers, with the result that the underlying dynamics has combinatorial implications.</description>
