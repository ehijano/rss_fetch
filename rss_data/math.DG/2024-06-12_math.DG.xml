      <title>Post-Einsteinian Effects in the General Theory of Relativity from Higher-Order Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I of this series, the author has shown how to extend the framework of Riemannian geometry so as to include infinitesimals of higher than first order. The purpose of the present contribution is to initiate an investigation into the implications of higher-order differential geometry for the general theory of relativity. As we have seen, a novel concept of inertial motion is implied in the analogue of the geodesic equation when modified to include the effects of higher infinitesimals and it therefore should not come as a surprise that it has potentially observable kinematic consequences. The route we prefer to take goes through the Einstein-Hilbert action generalized to reflect the presence of higher infinitesimals and a cosmological constant. A variational principle yields an hierarchy of field equations, which reduce to the Einsteinian case at first order. In the weak-field limit, we recover the usual relativistic equation for a moving body to leading order. To exemplify the theoretical framework, we undertake a preliminary study of the Schwarzschild solution and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology in the presence of second-order terms. But the most exciting results concern the novel effects in orbital mechanics that arise when the higher-order corrections cannot be neglected. Indeed, the higher-order Riemannian geometry predicts a modification of Newtonian dynamics corresponding to the Pioneer anomaly for a spacecraft on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the solar system and to the flyby anomaly for the differential between ingoing and outgoing asymptotic velocities of a spacecraft passing near a rotating planet -- both of which are found to agree well with sensitive empirical findings.</description>

      <title>Unification of the Fundamental Forces in Higher-Order Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I of the present series of papers, we adumbrate our idea of Riemannian geometry to higher order in the infinitesimals and derive expressions for the appropriate generalizations of parallel transport and the Riemannian curvature tensor. In Part II, the implications of higher-order geometry for the general theory of relativity beyond Einstein are developed. In the present Part III, we expand on the framework of Part II so as to take up the problem of field-theoretical unification. Employing the form of the Einstein-Hilbert action to higher order as proposed in Part II, we show how in nearly flat space the higher-order terms give rise to a gauge theory of Yang-Mills type. At the 2-jet level, the electroweak force emerges after imposition of gauge fixing. In fact, the proposed form of the Einstein-Hilbert action permits us to say more: we argue that the equivalence principle results in a Proca term that brings about the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the standard model. Two empirical predictions support our reasoning: first, we obtain a theoretical value for the Weinberg angle and second, we find that -- without any adjustable parameters -- the implied value of Coulomb's constant agrees well with experiment. The final section examines the 3-jet level. The same mechanism that produces Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory at the 2-jet level eventuates in a chromodynamical force having $SU(3)$ symmetry at the 3-jet level.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous G2 and Sasakian instantons on the Stiefel 7-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homogeneous instantons on the seven dimensional Stiefel manifold V in the context of G2 and Sasakian geometry. According to the reductive decomposition of V we provide an explicit description of all invariant G2 and Sasakian structures. In particular, we characterise the invariant G2- structures inducing a Sasakian metric, among which the well known nearly parallel G2-structure (Sasaki- Einstein) is included. As a consequence, we classify the invariant connections on homogeneous principal bundles over V with gauge group U(1) and SO(3), satisfying either the G2 or the Sasakian instanton condition. Finally, we analyse the Yang Mills condition for those invariant connections.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits %incorporates both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>Classification of nilpotent almost abelian Lie groups admitting left-invariant complex or symplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the nilpotent almost abelian Lie algebras admitting complex or symplectic structures. It turns out that if a nilpotent almost abelian Lie algebra admits a complex structure, then it necessarily admits a symplectic structure. Given an even dimensional almost abelian Lie algebra, we show that it always admits a complex structure when it is 2-step nilpotent and it always admits a symplectic structure when it is $k$-step nilpotent for $k=2, \, 3$ or $4$. Several consequences of the classification theorems are obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data on the propagation of wildfires show that its short-time spread has a double semi-elliptical shape. Our main goal is to show that this shape can be accurately approximated in polar coordinates by choosing suitable parameters in Gielis superformula and, then, implemented in a geometrical model for wildfire propagation. In this model, the firefront can be determined by computing the lightlike geodesics of a specific Finsler spacetime, and we derive a concise and efficient expression of the geodesic equations in these coordinates.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove gap theorems in Yang-Mills theory for complete four-dimensional manifolds with positive Yamabe constant. We extend the results of Gursky-Kelleher-Streets to complete manifolds. We also describe the equality in the gap theorem in terms of the basic instanton, which is interesting even for compact manifolds.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that for any compact Lie group $G$ (odd or even dimensional), the tangent bundle $TG$ admits a left-invariant integrable almost complex structure, where the Lie group structure on $TG$ is the natural one induced from $G$. The aforementioned complex structure on $TG$ is inspired by Samelson's construction for even dimensional compact Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the quermassintegrals for compact hypersurfaces with capillary boundaries in hyperbolic space from a variational viewpoint, and then we solve an isoperimetric type problem in hyperbolic space. By constructing a new locally constrained inverse curvature flow, we obtain the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex capillary hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. This generalizes a theorem of Brendle-Guan-Li \cite{BGL} for convex closed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Morse Index Stability for the Ginzburg-Landau Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behaviour of critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau perturbation of the Dirichlet energy into the sphere $E_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Sigma \frac{1}{2}|du|^2_h\ \,dvol_h +\frac{1}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|u|^2)^2\,dvol_h=\int_{\Sigma}e_{\varepsilon}(u)$. Our first main result is a precise point-wise estimate for $e_\varepsilon(u_k)$ in the regions where compactness fails, which also implies the $L^{2,1}$ quantization in the bubbling process. Our second main result consists in applying the method developed in a previous joint paper with T. Rivi\`ere to study the upper-semi-continuity of the extended Morse index to sequences of critical points of $E_{\epsilon}$: given a sequence of critical points $u_{\varepsilon_k}:\Sigma\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of $E_\varepsilon$ that converges in the bubble tree sense to a harmonic map $u_\infty\in W^{1,2}(\Sigma,{S}^{n})$ and bubbles $v^i_{\infty}:\mathbb{R}^2\to {S}^{n}$, we show that the extended Morse indices of the maps $v^i,u_\infty$ control the extended Morse index of the sequence $u_{\varepsilon_k}$ for $k$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness on average of large isoperimetric sets in noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which is not isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n$, has nonnegative Ricci curvature, Euclidean volume growth, and quadratic Riemann curvature decay. We prove that there is a set $\mathcal{G}\subset (0,\infty)$ with density $1$ at infinity such that for every $V\in \mathcal{G}$ there is a unique isoperimetric set of volume $V$ in $M$, and its boundary is strictly volume preserving stable.
  The latter result cannot be improved to uniqueness or strict stability for every large volume. Indeed, we construct a complete Riemannian surface that satisfies the previous assumptions, and with the following property: there are arbitrarily large and diverging intervals $I_n\subset (0,\infty)$ such that isoperimetric sets with volumes $V\in I_n$ exist, but they are neither unique nor they have strictly volume preserving stable boundaries.
  The proof relies on a set of new ideas, as the present setting goes beyond the range of applicability of the methods based on the implicit function theorem, and no symmetry is assumed.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider circle patterns on closed tori equipped with complex projective structures. There is an embedding of the space of circle patterns to the Teichm\"{u}ller space of a punctured surface. Via the embedding, the Weil-Petersson symplectic form is pulled back to the space of circle patterns. We investigate its non-degeneracy. On the other hand, we also complete a conjecture that the space of circle patterns is homeomorphic to the Teichm\"{u}ller space of the closed torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of curved Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) sequences in parabolic geometry and their role in $K$-homology and noncommutative geometry. The BGG-sequences fit into $K$-homology, and we solve their index problem. We provide a condition for when the BGG-complex on the flat parabolic geometry $G/P$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ fits into $G$-equivariant $K$-homology by means of Heisenberg calculus. For higher rank Lie groups, we prove a no-go theorem showing that the approach fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of an extremal horizon in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory must admit a Killing vector field or is static. This implies that any such horizon must be an extremal Kerr-Newman horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Convergence stability for Ricci flow on manifolds with bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Ricci flow for complete metrics with bounded geometry depends continuously on initial conditions for finite time with no loss of regularity. This relies on our recent work where sectoriality for the generator of the Ricci-DeTurck flow is proved. We use this to prove that for initial metrics sufficiently close in H\"older norm to a rotationally symmetric asymptotically hyperbolic metric and satisfying a simple curvature condition, but a priori distant from the hyperbolic metric, Ricci flow converges to the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized K\"ahler manifolds via mapping tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the product of a $3$-torus and a compact K\"ahler (respectively, hyperK\"ahler) manifold we construct via mapping tori generalized K\"ahler manifolds of split (respectively, non-split) type. In this way we obtain new non-K\"ahler examples and we recover the known examples of generalized K\"ahler solvmanifolds. Moreover, we investigate the formality and the Dolbeault cohomology of the generalized K\"ahler mapping tori.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit, and does not involve analytic continuation or algebraic topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples of deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections and deformed Spin(7)-instantons (also called Spin(7) deformed Donaldson-Thomas connections) on the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$ endowed with the Calabi hyperK\"ahler structure. Deformed Spin(7)-instantons on cones over 3-Sasakian 7-manifolds are also constructed. We show that these can be used to distinguish between isometric structures and also between Sp(2) and Spin(7) holonomy cones. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial examples of deformed Spin(7)-instantons.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Ros principle and its application to surface theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exists the duality between normal family theory and value distribution theory of meromorphic functions, which is called the Bloch principle. Zalcman formulated a more precise statement on it. In this paper, based on the Zalcman and Ros work, we comprehend the phenomenon of the trinity among normal family theory, value distribution theory and minimal surface theory and give a systematic description to the relationship among the Montel theorem, the Liuoville theorem and the Bernstein theorem as well as the Carath\'{e}odory-Montel theorem, the Picard little theorem and the Fujimoto theorem. We call this phenomenon Bloch-Ros principle. We also generalize the Bloch-Ros principle to various classes of surfaces, for instance, maxfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski $3$-space, improper affine fronts in the affine $3$-space and flat fronts in the hyperbolic $3$-space. In particular, we give an effective criterion to determine which properties for meromorphic functions that play a role of the Gauss maps of these classes of surfaces satisfy the Gaussian curvature estimate.</description>

      <title>Bakry-\`Emery, Hardy, and Spectral Gap Estimates on Manifolds with Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectral properties and geometric functional inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $\ge3$ with (finite or countably many) conical singularities $\{z_i\}_{i\in\mathfrak I}$ in the neighborhood of which the largest lower bound for the Ricci curvature is \begin{equation}\label{d2} k(x)\simeq K_i-\frac{s_i}{d^2(z_i,x)}. \end{equation} Thus none of the existing Bakry-\'Emery inequalities or curvature-dimension conditions apply. In particular, $k$ does not belong to the Kato (or (extended Kato) class, and $(M,g)$ is not tamed. Manifolds with such a singular Ricci bound appear quite naturally., e.g. as cones over spheres of radius $&gt;1$
  For such manifolds with conical singularities we will prove
  * a version of the Bakry-\'Emery inequality
  * a novel Hardy inequality
  * a spectral gap estimate.</description>

      <title>Mapping class group of manifolds which look like $3$-dimensional complete intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the mapping class group of closed simply-connected 6-manifolds $M$ which look like complete intersections, i.~e.~ $H_2(M;\mathbb Z) \cong \mathbb Z $ and $x^3 \ne 0$ where $x \in H^2(M; \mathbb Z)$ is a generator. We determine some algebraic properties of the mapping class group; for example we compute its abelianization and its center. We show that modulo the center the mapping class group is residually finite and virtually torsion-free. We also study low dimensional homology groups. The results are very similar to the computation of the mapping class group of Riemann surfaces. We give generators of the mapping class group, and generators and relations for the subgroup acting trivially on $\pi_{3}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Bounding the diameter and eigenvalues of amply regular graphs via Lin-Lu-Yau curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An amply regular graph is a regular graph such that any two adjacent vertices have $\alpha$ common neighbors and any two vertices with distance $2$ have $\beta$ common neighbors. We prove a sharp lower bound estimate for the Lin--Lu--Yau curvature of any amply regular graph with girth $3$ and $\beta&gt;\alpha$. The proof involves new ideas relating discrete Ricci curvature with local matching properties: This includes a novel construction of a regular bipartite graph from the local structure and related distance estimates. As a consequence, we obtain sharp diameter and eigenvalue bounds for amply regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of hyperconvex representations of hyperbolic groups in ${\rm PSL}(d,\mathbb{C})$ and establish two structural results: a group admitting a hyperconvex representation is virtually isomorphic to a Kleinian group, and its hyperconvex limit set in the appropriate flag manifold has Hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than $2$.</description>
