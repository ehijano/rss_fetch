      <title>Predictive Non-linear Dynamics via Neural Networks and Recurrence Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing diverse non-linear behaviors in dynamical systems is a complex challenge, especially due to the inherently presence of chaotic dynamics. Current forecasting methods are reliant on system-specific knowledge or heavily parameterized models, which can be associated with a variety of drawbacks including critical model assumptions, uncertainties in their estimated input hyperparameters, and also being computationally intensive. Moreover, even when combined with recurrence analyses, these approaches are typically constrained to chaos identification, rather than parameter inference. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a methodology that uses recurrence plots to train convolutional neural networks with the task of estimating the defining control parameters of two distinct non-linear systems: (i) the Logistic map and (ii) the Standard map. By focusing on the neural networks' ability to recognize patterns within recurrence plots, we demonstrate accurate parameter recovery, achieving fairly confident levels of prediction for both systems. This method not only provides a robust approach to predicting diverse non-linear dynamics but also opens up new possibilities for the automated characterization of similar non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Tangent Space Causal Inference: Leveraging Vector Fields for Causal Discovery in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery with time series data remains a challenging yet increasingly important task across many scientific domains. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) and related methods have been proposed to study time series that are generated by dynamical systems, where traditional approaches like Granger causality are unreliable. However, CCM often yields inaccurate results depending upon the quality of the data. We propose the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI) method for detecting causalities in dynamical systems. TSCI works by considering vector fields as explicit representations of the systems' dynamics and checks for the degree of synchronization between the learned vector fields. The TSCI approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a drop-in replacement for CCM and its generalizations. We first present a basic version of the TSCI algorithm, which is shown to be more effective than the basic CCM algorithm with very little additional computation. We additionally present augmented versions of TSCI that leverage the expressive power of latent variable models and deep learning. We validate our theory on standard systems, and we demonstrate improved causal inference performance across a number of benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>A kneading map of chaotic switching oscillations in a Kerr cavity with two interacting light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical systems that combine nonlinearity with coupling between various subsystems offer a flexible platform for observing a diverse range of nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, engineering tolerances are such that the subsystems can be identical to within a fraction of the wavelength of light; hence, such coupled systems inherently have a natural symmetry that can lead to either delocalization or symmetry breaking. We consider here an optical Kerr cavity that supports two interacting electric fields, generated by two symmetric input beams. Mathematically, this system is modeled by a four-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant vector field with the strength and detuning of the input light as control parameters. Previous research has shown that complex switching dynamics are observed both experimentally and numerically across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we show that particular switching patterns are created at specific global bifurcations through either delocalization or symmetry breaking of a chaotic attractor. We find that the system exhibits infinitely many of these global bifurcations, which are organized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant codimension-two Belyakov transitions. We investigate these switching dynamics by means of the continuation of global bifurcations in combination with the computation of kneading invariants and Lyapunov exponents. In this way, we provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay between different switching patterns of periodic orbits and chaotic attractors.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Alternative climatic steady states near the Permian-Triassic Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>
