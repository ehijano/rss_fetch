      <title>Dagger-Drazin Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drazin inverses are a special kind of generalized inverses that can be defined for endomorphisms in any category. A natural question to ask is whether one can somehow extend the notion of Drazin inverse to arbitrary maps -- not simply endomorphisms. It turns out that this is possible and, indeed, natural to do so for dagger categories. This paper, thus, introduces the notion of a dagger-Drazin inverse, which is a new kind of generalized inverse appropriate for arbitrary maps in a dagger category. This inverse is closely related to the Drazin inverse, for having dagger-Drazin inverses is equivalent to asking that positive maps have Drazin inverses. Moreover, dagger-Drazin inverses are also closely related to Moore-Penrose inverses as we observe that a map has a Moore-Penrose inverse if and only if it is a Drazin-inverse. Furthermore, we explain how Drazin inverses of opposing pairs correspond precisely to dagger-Drazin inverses in cofree dagger categories. We also give examples of dagger-Drazin inverses for matrices over (involutive) fields, bounded linear operators, and partial injections.</description>

      <title>Simplicial effects and weakly associative partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new category of simplicial effects that extends the categories of effect algebras and their multi-object counterpart, effect algebroids. Our approach is based on relaxing the associativity condition satisfied by effect algebras and, more generally, partial monoids. Within this framework, simplicial effects and weakly associative partial groups arise as two extreme cases in the category of weak partial monoids. Our motivation is to capture simplicial structures from the theory of simplicial distributions and measurements that behave like effects.</description>

      <title>Frobenius reciprocity, modular connections, lattice isomorphism theorem and abstract principal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is to fill a gap in the literature: Frobenius reciprocity in the theory of doctrines is closely related to modular connections in projective homological algebra and the notion of a principal element in abstract commutative ideal theory. These concepts are based on particular properties of Galois connections which play an important role also in the abstract study of group-like structures from the perspective of categorical/universal algebra; such role stems from a classical and basic result in group theory: the lattice isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <title>The Category of Atomic Monoids: Universal Constructions and Arithmetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the category $\mathsf{AtoMon}$ of atomic monoids and atom-preserving monoid homomorphisms, which is a (non-full) subcategory of the usual category of monoids. In particular, we compute all limits and colimits, showing that $\mathsf{AtoMon}$ is a complete and cocomplete category. We also address certain arithmetic properties of products and coproducts, providing explicit formulas for some fundamental invariants associated with factorization lengths in atomic monoids.</description>

      <title>Lallement functor is a weak right multiadjoint</title>

Abstract: For a plural signature $\Sigma$ and with regard to the category $\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}$, of naturally preordered idempotent $\Sigma$-algebras and surjective homomorphisms, we define a contravariant functor $\mathrm{Lsys}_{\Sigma}$ from $\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}$ to $\mathsf{Cat}$, the category of categories, that assigns to $\mathbf{I}$ in $\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}$ the category $\mathbf{I}$-$\mathsf{LAlg}(\Sigma)$, of $\mathbf{I}$-semi-inductive Lallement systems of $\Sigma$-algebras, and a covariant functor $(\mathsf{Alg}(\Sigma)\,{\downarrow_{\mathsf{s}}}\, \cdot)$ from $\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}$ to $\mathsf{Cat}$, that assigns to $\mathbf{I}$ in $\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}$ the category $(\mathsf{Alg}(\Sigma)\,{\downarrow_{\mathsf{s}}}\, \mathbf{I})$, of the coverings of $\mathbf{I}$, i.e., the ordered pairs $(\mathbf{A},f)$ in which $\mathbf{A}$ is a $\Sigma$-algebra and $f\colon \mathbf{A}\longrightarrow \mathbf{I}$ a surjective homomorphism. Then, by means of the Grothendieck construction, we obtain the categories $\int^{\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}}\mathrm{Lsys}_{\Sigma}$ and $\int_{\mathsf{NPIAlg}(\Sigma)_{\mathsf{s}}}(\mathsf{Alg}(\Sigma)\,{\downarrow_{\mathsf{s}}}\, \cdot)$; define a functor $\mathfrak{L}_{\Sigma}$ from the first category to the second, which we will refer to as the Lallement functor; and prove that it is a weak right multiadjoint. Finally, we state the relationship between the P{\l}onka functor and the Lallement functor.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda .</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus be confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. Thus a timeseries may not have a unique source. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and timeseries data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. We show that the transformations preserve these relations, and thus have the mathematical property of being functors. Secondly we show that under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction algorithms are themselves functors from the category of timeseries-data into the category of dynamical systems. Finally we present the task of inverting the data into dynamics, using the language of Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of inverse limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of nuclear modules on an affine formal scheme as defined by Clausen and Scholze \cite{CS20}. We also study related constructions in the framework of dualizable and rigid monoidal categories. We prove that the $K$-theory (in the sense of \cite{E24}) of the category of nuclear modules on $\operatorname{Spf}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ is isomorphic to the classical continuous $K$-theory, which in the noetherian case is given by the limit $\varprojlim\limits_{n} K(R/I^n).$ This isomorphism was conjectured previously by Clausen and Scholze.
  More precisely, we study two versions of the category of nuclear modules: the original one defined in \cite{CS20} and a different version, which contains the original one as a full subcategory. For our category $\operatorname{Nuc}(R^{\wedge}_I)$ we give three equivalent definitions. The first definition is by taking the internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the category $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}$ of $R$-linear dualizable categories. The second definition is by taking the rigidification of the usual $I$-complete derived category of $R.$ The third definition is by taking an inverse limit in $\operatorname{Cat}_R^{\operatorname{dual}}.$ For each of the three approaches we prove that the corresponding construction is well-behaved in a certain sense.
  Moreover, we prove that the two versions of the category of nuclear modules have the same $K$-theory, and in fact the same finitary localizing invariants.</description>
