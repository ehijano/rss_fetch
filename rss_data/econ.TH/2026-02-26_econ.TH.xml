      <title>Delegation in Strategic Environments and Equilibrium Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask when a normal-form game yields a single equilibrium prediction, even if players can coordinate by delegating play to an intermediary such as a platform or a cartel. Delegation outcomes are modeled via coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) when the intermediary cannot punish deviators, and via the set of individually rational correlated profiles (IRCP) when it can. We characterize games in which the IRCP or the CCE is unique, uncovering a structural link between these solution concepts. Our analysis also provides new conditions for the uniqueness of classical correlated and Nash equilibria that do not rely on the existence of dominant strategies. The resulting equilibria are robust to players' information about the environment, payoff perturbations, pre-play communication, equilibrium selection, and learning dynamics. We apply these results to collusion-proof mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multidimensional Contests with Asymmetric Players: Equilibrium and Optimal Prize Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $n$-dimensional contest between two asymmetric players with different marginal effort costs, with each dimension (i.e., battle) modeled as a Tullock contest. We allow general identity-independent and budget-balanced prize allocation rules in which each player's prize increases weakly in the number of their victories, e.g., a majority rule if $n$ is odd. When the discriminatory power of the Tullock winner-selection mechanism is no greater than $2/(n+1)$, a unique equilibrium arises where each player exerts deterministic and identical effort across all dimensions. This condition applies uniformly to all eligible prize allocation rules and all levels of players' asymmetry, and it is tight. Under this condition, we derive the effort-maximizing prize allocation rule: the entire prize is awarded to the player who wins more battles than his opponent by a pre-specified margin, and the prize is split equally if neither player does. When $n$ is odd, and players are symmetric, the majority rule is optimal.</description>

      <title>Simple vs. Optimal Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion pricing has emerged as an effective tool for mitigating traffic congestion, yet implementing welfare or revenue-optimal dynamic tolls is often impractical. Most real-world congestion pricing deployments, including New York City's recent program, rely on significantly simpler, often static, tolls. This discrepancy motivates the question of how much revenue and welfare loss there is when real-world traffic systems use static rather than optimal dynamic pricing.
  We address this question by analyzing the performance gap between static (simple) and dynamic (optimal) congestion pricing schemes in two canonical frameworks: Vickrey's bottleneck model with a public transit outside option and its city-scale extension based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). In both models, we first characterize the revenue-optimal static and dynamic tolling policies, which have received limited attention in prior work. In the worst-case, revenue-optimal static tolls achieve at least half of the dynamic optimal revenue and at most twice the minimum achievable system cost across a wide range of practically relevant parameter regimes, with stronger and more general guarantees in the bottleneck model than in the MFD model. We further corroborate our theoretical guarantees with numerical results based on real-world datasets from the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City, which demonstrate that static tolls achieve roughly 80-90% of the dynamic optimal revenue while incurring at most a 8-20% higher total system cost than the minimum achievable system cost.</description>

      <title>A Model of Polarization on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model of social media in which users produce different types of content and choose whom to follow. Even when abstracting from algorithmic bias, linking costs shape networks and polarization. In the welfare-maximizing equilibrium, lower linking costs can raise welfare but also increase exposure to extreme content, while very low costs reduce welfare and heighten polarization by discouraging moderate contributors. Policies that incentivize content provision can generate large welfare gains by changing who produces information, whereas link subsidies or attention reallocation mainly affect exposure and have limited welfare impact. These insights help explain why exposure-based interventions on social media platforms often yield ambiguous effects on polarization.</description>

      <title>On click-fraud under pro-rata revenue sharing rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-fraud is commonly seen as a key vulnerability of pro-rata revenue sharing rule on music streaming platforms, whereas user-centric is largely immune. This paper develops a tractable non-cooperative model in which artists can purchase fraud activity that generates undetectable fake streams up to a technological limit. We defend pro-rata by showing that it is fraud-robust: when fraud technology is weak, honesty is a strictly dominant strategy, and an efficient fraud-free equilibrium obtains; when fraud technology is strong, a unique fraud equilibrium arises, yet aggregate fake streams remain bounded. Although fraud is inefficient, the resulting redistribution may improve fairness in some cases. To mitigate fraud without abandoning pro-rata, we introduce a parametric weighted rule that interpolates between pro-rata and user-centric, and characterize parameter ranges that restore a fraud-free equilibrium under technology constraint. We also discuss implications of Spotify's modernized royalty system for fraud incentives.</description>

      <title>Selective Disclosure in Overlapping Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an overlapping generations model where each agent observes a verifiable private signal about the state and, with positive probability, also receives signals disclosed by his predecessor. The agent then takes an action and decides which signals to pass on. Each agent's action has a positive externality on his predecessor and his optimal action increases in his belief about the state. We show that as the probability that messages reach the next generation approaches one, agents become increasingly selective in disclosing information. In the limit, all signals except for the most favorable ones will be concealed.</description>

      <title>Robust Mechanism Design with Anonymous Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practice, auction data are often endogenously censored and anonymous, revealing only limited outcome statistics rather than full bid profiles. We study robust auction design when the seller observes only aggregated, anonymous order statistics and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue over all product distributions consistent with the observed statistic. We show that simple and widely used mechanisms are robustly optimal. Specifically, posted pricing is robustly optimal given the distribution of the highest value; the Myerson auction designed for the unique consistent i.i.d. distribution is robustly optimal given the lowest value distribution; and the second-price auction with an optimal reserve is robustly optimal when an intermediate order statistic is observed and the implied i.i.d. distribution is regular above its reserve. More generally, for a broad class of monotone symmetric mechanisms depending only on the top k order statistics, including multi-unit and position auctions, the worst-case revenue is attained under the i.i.d. distribution consistent with the observed k-th order statistic. Our results provide a tractable foundation for non-discriminatory auction design, where fairness and privacy are intrinsic consequences of the information structure rather than imposed constraints.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, it becomes necessary to solve the "Master equation", in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>
