      <title>SpikEmo: Enhancing Emotion Recognition With Spiking Temporal Dynamics in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In affective computing, the task of Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has emerged as a focal area of research. The primary objective of this task is to predict emotional states within conversations by analyzing multimodal data including text, audio, and video. While existing studies have progressed in extracting and fusing representations from multimodal data, they often overlook the temporal dynamics in the data during conversations. To address this challenge, we have developed the SpikEmo framework, which is based on spiking neurons and employs a Semantic &amp; Dynamic Two-stage Modeling approach to more precisely capture the complex temporal features of multimodal emotional data. Additionally, to tackle the class imbalance and emotional semantic similarity problems in the ERC tasks, we have devised an innovative combination of loss functions that significantly enhances the model's performance when dealing with ERC data characterized by long-tail distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple ERC benchmark datasets demonstrate that SpikEmo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in ERC tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-xm/SpikEmo.git.</description>

      <title>WavChat: A Survey of Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

      <title>X-CrossNet: A complex spectral mapping approach to target speaker extraction with cross attention speaker embedding fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) is a technique for isolating a target speaker's voice from mixed speech using auxiliary features associated with the target speaker. This approach addresses the cocktail party problem and is generally considered more promising for practical applications than conventional speech separation methods. Although academic research in this area has achieved high accuracy and evaluation scores on public datasets, most models exhibit significantly reduced performance in real-world noisy or reverberant conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel TSE model, X-CrossNet, which leverages CrossNet as its backbone. CrossNet is a speech separation network specifically optimized for challenging noisy and reverberant environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as speaker separation under these conditions. Additionally, to enhance the network's ability to capture and utilize auxiliary features of the target speaker, we integrate a Cross-Attention mechanism into the global multi-head self-attention (GMHSA) module within each CrossNet block. This facilitates more effective integration of target speaker features with mixed speech features. Experimental results show that our method performs superior separation on the WSJ0-2mix and WHAMR! datasets, demonstrating strong robustness and stability.</description>

      <title>Robust Steganography with Boundary-Preserving Overflow Alleviation and Adaptive Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of the Internet, the vast amount of data has created opportunities for fostering the development of steganographic techniques. However, traditional steganographic techniques encounter challenges due to distortions in online social networks, such as JPEG recompression. Presently, research into the lossy operations of spatial truncation in JPEG recompression remains limited. Existing methods aim to ensure the stability of the quantized coefficients by reducing the effects of spatial truncation. Nevertheless, these approaches may induce notable alterations to image pixels, potentially compromising anti-steganalysis performance. In this study, we analyzed the overflow characteristics of spatial blocks and observed that pixel values at the boundaries of spatial blocks are more prone to overflow. Building upon this observation, we proposed a preprocessing method that performs overflow removal operations based on the actual overflow conditions of spatial blocks. After preprocessing, our algorithm enhances coefficient stability while minimizing modifications to spatial block boundaries, favoring image quality preservation. Subsequently, we employed adaptive error correction coding to reduce coding redundancy, thereby augmenting robustness and mitigating its impact on anti-steganalysis performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method possesses a strong embedding capacity, maintaining a high level of robustness while enhancing security.</description>

      <title>Compact Visual Data Representation for Green Multimedia -- A Human Visual System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Human Visual System (HVS), with its intricate sophistication, is capable of achieving ultra-compact information compression for visual signals. This remarkable ability is coupled with high generalization capability and energy efficiency. By contrast, the state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard achieves a compression ratio of around 1,000 times for raw visual data. This notable disparity motivates the research community to draw inspiration to effectively handle the immense volume of visual data in a green way. Therefore, this paper provides a survey of how visual data can be efficiently represented for green multimedia, in particular when the ultimate task is knowledge extraction instead of visual signal reconstruction. We introduce recent research efforts that promote green, sustainable, and efficient multimedia in this field. Moreover, we discuss how the deep understanding of the HVS can benefit the research community, and envision the development of future green multimedia technologies.</description>

      <title>HARP: A Large-Scale Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has transformed digital content creation and manipulation. Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research. We aim to democratize powerful visual editing across various industries, from entertainment to education.
