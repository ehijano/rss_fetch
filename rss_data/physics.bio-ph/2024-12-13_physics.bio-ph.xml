      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enhanced chemiluminescence vertical flow assay for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Democratizing biomarker testing at the point-of-care requires innovations that match laboratory-grade sensitivity and precision in an accessible format. Here, we demonstrate high-sensitivity detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) through innovations in chemiluminescence-based sensing, imaging, and deep learning-driven analysis. This chemiluminescence vertical flow assay (CL-VFA) enables rapid, low-cost, and precise quantification of cTnI, a key cardiac protein for assessing heart muscle damage and myocardial infarction. The CL-VFA integrates a user-friendly chemiluminescent paper-based sensor, a polymerized enzyme-based conjugate, a portable high-performance CL reader, and a neural network-based cTnI concentration inference algorithm. The CL-VFA measures cTnI over a broad dynamic range covering six orders of magnitude and operates with 50 uL of serum per test, delivering results in 25 min. This system achieves a detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL with an average coefficient of variation under 15%, surpassing traditional benchtop analyzers in sensitivity by an order of magnitude. In blinded validation, the computational CL-VFA accurately measured cTnI concentrations in patient samples, demonstrating a robust correlation against a clinical-grade FDA-cleared analyzer. These results highlight the potential of CL-VFA as a robust diagnostic tool for accessible, rapid cardiac biomarker testing that meets the needs of diverse healthcare settings, from emergency care to underserved regions.</description>

      <title>Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the advantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic equations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial correlations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of active soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collective behavior of living creatures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>

      <title>Elastic Modulus Versus Cell Packing Density in MDCK Epithelial Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic moduli of tissues are connected to their states of health and function. The epithelial monolayer is a simple, minimal, tissue model that is often used to gain understanding of mechanical behavior at the cellular or multi-cellular scale. Here we investigate how the elastic modulus of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells depends on their packing density. Rather than measuring elasticity at the sub-cellular scale with local probes, we characterize the monolayer at the multi-cellular scale, as one would a thin slab of elastic material. We use a micro-indentation system to apply gentle forces to the apical side of MDCK monolayers, applying a normal force to approximately 100 cells in each experiment. In low-density confluent monolayers, we find that the elastic modulus decreases with increasing cell density. At high densities, the modulus appears to plateau. This finding will help guide our understanding of known collective behaviors in epithelial monolayers and other tissues where variations in cell packing density are correlated with cell motion.</description>

      <title>Data-driven theory reveals protrusion and polarity interactions governing collision behavior of distinct motile cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on 14 candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, protrusion, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering suppression for in vivo optical coherence tomography measurement using B-scan-wise multi-focus averaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular rotors form twisted conformations upon photoexcitation, with their fluorescent relaxation time serving as a measure of viscosity. They have been used to assess membrane viscosities but yield higher values compared to other methods. Here, we show that the rotor's relaxation time is influenced by a combination of membrane viscosity and interleaflet friction. We present a theory for the relaxation time and obtain a correction factor that accounts for the discrepancy. If the membrane's viscosity is known, molecular rotors may enable the extraction of the elusive interleaflet friction.</description>
